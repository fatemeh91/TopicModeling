review/text: first off, i hate cleaning dishes so i use my dishwasher A LOT. i do rinse off my dishes before putting them in for wash so i don't really have any issues with "stuck-on" foods.these tablets do a decent job, just like any other tablets i've used. however, these are individually packaged in a small plastic wraps. they are not the type with disintegrating packaging. i'm an extremely lazy person so having to rip the plastic and then walk all the way to the garbage can, wait for the motion sensor of the garbage can to detect me and open the lid, just to discard the wrapping, becomes very tedious. if you don't doing all that work, dishes and glasses come out stain-free and clean.overall, i'm very satisfied with this product. i'd give 4.5 stars if i could.
