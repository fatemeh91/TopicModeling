review/text: I can't complain about the message this machine produces as I haven't used it much! lol I got this machine few months ago and still can't use it as it produces a huge amount of harsh vibrations that reaches the handles which makes it really difficult to hold. I tried to convince my wife to use it on me but she always refuses preferring to make it with bare hands saying "It really hurts"! also as soon as you plug and operate this machine it produces a very very noisy and scary sound that really freaks me out every time i try to operate it. It feels as if it's going to explode or at least burn.If i had the chance to return it I'd definitely do, too bad I can't as I already left the US
