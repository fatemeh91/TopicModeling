review/text: I compared this thermometer with a brand new one given to me by a nurse. Professional thermometer read: 97.9, 97.9, 97.9 (normal for me). Vicks read: 98.4, 98.3, 98.4, 97.8. 97.9, 98.0, 98.0, 98.0. Fifteen minutes later, professional read: 97.8, 97.8. Vicks read: 98.2, 97.9, 97.7. This degree of inaccuracy raises serious questions about the manufacturer.
