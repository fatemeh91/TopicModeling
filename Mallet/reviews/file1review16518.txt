review/text: The product seems to perform as stated. I have been using this product for several months and I am less sore between workouts. I have noticed a more "chiseled" look in muscle structure -- the only downside -- does not taste good when mixed with water; but I mix it with my diet (sugarless) green tea and it tastes OK.
