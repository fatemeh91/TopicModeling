review/text: I was surprised after having a left ankle osteotomy that my physician prescribed a heavy compression knee high stocking for my repaired foot. While it was initially difficult to get on over the swelling appendage, it did provide some comfort by almost acting like a mild cast. I learned to have my foot totally dry before pulling it on and occasionally used baby powder to help slide it on.My problems with this compression stocking, besides the fact that it's very ugly, are two-fold. After wearing it for about an hour, the compression on my toes became too strong and caused pain. And after pulling it on and off about 20 times, I began to tear it. I don't know if washing it ended up weakening the fabric or if it just wore out.Everyone's experience is bound to be different depending on your usage and how it fits you. The prices on Amazon are much better than in the retail stores.
