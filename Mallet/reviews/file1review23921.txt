review/text: I have just one link for you:[...]Don't just purchase things because you "hear" about their efficiency. Do some research before you buy stuff.I believe in traditional Chinese medicine and many kinds of alternative medicine, but crap is still crap and in fact this illegitimizes real alternative medicine. This has been diluted TWO HUNDRED TIMES; read up on what it is and how it's made before you put it into your body.Fortunately this is nothing more than a placebo so at least you're not harming anything but your wallet.
