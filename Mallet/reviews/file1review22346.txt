review/text: I bought the Glade Holiday Apple Cinnamon Value Pack in a lightning deal. Once I got it, it smelled so great and I liked the package so much I ordered more for holiday presents. The three products are good quality and the cinnamon essence makes your house (or office) smell marvelous. I purchased for home, work and friends.This was a great deal & the shipping was fantastic as usual.
