review/text: I was let down by this product. The idea was nice but the execution did not come through for me. The makers claim that the ends are sharp but they are squared off. The ends appose reasonably well but are bowed slightly so in order to grasp a hair you need to squeeze fairly hard, that is when the ends slip past one another. I am used to using a stainless steel surgical grade forcep and these are nowhere near that level. Dissappointed that I spent this money.
