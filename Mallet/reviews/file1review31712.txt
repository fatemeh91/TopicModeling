review/text: I am a fan of Source Naturals vitamins and have been for about 10 years. The vitamins are always obtained from natural sources and formulated into excellent and effective products. I found the x1 30 mg softgels COQ10 to be sufficient for my needs, and feel an almost immediate effect when using the product (taken with a meal) I do not recommend taking this product with dinner, or you might find yourself up all night. It adds a great amount of non-nervous energy and vitality. I also take Source Naturals NKO Neptune Krill Oil and this product is certified and manufactured by a company for Source Naturuals that uses only 100% Neptune Krill Oil, which means that your getting your money's worth. Their products are high quality and do what they are advertised to do. If you don't take vitamins regularly, then expect that it may take some time to see benefits thereof
