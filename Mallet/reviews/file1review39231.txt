review/text: For the cheap cost of these cutters all you have to do is use them twice and it covers the cost. You do get what you pay for though. The accesories are very cheap feeling. The scissors are junk and the "cape" is a cheap plastic bag with a string. Now the clippers are actually pretty good and cut well with just two or three passes. I was releived to see that the different pieces are labeled just like they are at a barbershop so if you like a two just like I do you will know which one to use. These clippers do tend to pull if you start moving to fast even after being oiled, but it is nothing really that horrible. If you leave these clippers running for too long they start to get REALLY hot and you can even start smelling burning hair. So the second time I used them I just turned them off if I was pausing for a second and that seemed to fix that problem.So overall I recommend these clippers to someone who is cutting only one persons hair at a time and wants something cheap that will get the job done well. I would not recomend this to someone who has to cut a whole family's worth of hair every couple weeks. I would advise getting a WAHL with a cool running motor.
