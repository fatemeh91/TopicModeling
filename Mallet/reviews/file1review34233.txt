review/text: This Mayinglong Musk Hemorrhoid Ointment Cream works but has a few problems that might prevent customers from wanting to seek buying it. First of all, and most importantly, it DOES sting upon applying it to the area. Alright, stinging is such a light word. It downright irritates. BUT... it's only for a few seconds. I'm sure you can deal with the sudden increase in pain if the result is relief soon after (possibly even instant relief if you're lucky). Another problem is that the medicine smells and you do NOT want family and friends smelling this stuff. That would be really embarrassing, haha. I guess if the hemorrhoid pain you're experiencing increases enough you won't even care what other people think about the smelly medicine- you'll be focused just on making sure the pain is gone and honestly that's what matters the most. Overall, it's a good product but it certainly has some flaws so you've been warned.
