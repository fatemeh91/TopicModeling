review/text: Talk about one good product - MAN!I used to struggle daily each morning to get my socks on.A lot of times I would have to rest or go back to bed, myhips and thighs would just be killing me.This simple device is a godsend to anyone trying to get dressedany day of the week. I would put my socks on and not remove themuntil the last thing at night. I would take naps during the dayand leave my socks on. Not anymore! It is such a breeze puttingmy socks on I do it several times a day!My sock getter- oner goes with me hunting, fishing or traveling.YES, YES, YES!
