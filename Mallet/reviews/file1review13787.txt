review/text: I purchased the owl lite from ads I saw on TV. It is advertised as credit card sized, but that is misleading. It is in fact the shape of a creidt card, but it has the thickness of three credit cards stacked. That is too large for my wallet. It works as advertised so I may throw one in my gym or computer bag, but i can't put it in my wallet which is what I wanted.
