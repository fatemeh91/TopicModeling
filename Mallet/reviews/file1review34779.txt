review/text: I love this deodorant, This is strictly what I use. I love the pine smell of it, and unlike most natural deodorants I have tried this works amazing. I work in construction...and very rarely does this fail me.. and on the rare occasion that it does just another spray or two keeps me smelling fresh.
