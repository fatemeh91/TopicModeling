review/text: I really enjoy this product and I am going to buy another one for my other bathroom. it is easy to install and really sturdy. It cuts out the step of training from floor potty to toilet. It is the perfect size for little bums so they don't fall in the toilet. (my son is really skinny) its easy to hang and if you want you can put it in an extra large Ziploc and take it with you when you have to go out in case you need to use a public toilet. great product and totally worth the price!
