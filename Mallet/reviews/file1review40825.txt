review/text: It's alright. It gives a great shave and love the fact that the fact that the shaving cream is basically built in (I share a bathroom with other college girls, and as you can imagine, space is a premium). However, the blades are almost $3 each a Kroger. They're cheaper on Ebay, but do I really want 72 blades?I had problems reaching some angles with it, especially when the soap was new. While I think it gives a better shave than the Venus, it's not a very good value. I also noticed that my blade began to rust (I did not use it every day, so it lasted longer than it would have) when the soap began to run low. I really liked the Silk Effects, but I haven't been able to find the blades lately.
