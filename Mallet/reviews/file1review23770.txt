review/text: I have plantar fasciitis. The doctor sold me a $75 pair of "professionally fit" orthotics that hurt my feet something awful! I ordered these and the pain is gone! They make my regular work shoes too tight, but casual shoes are fine if you take out the insole that came with the shoe. I will order the "thin" version to see if they work in my dressier shoes and boots. No more expensive crap for me!
