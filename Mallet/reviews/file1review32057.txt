review/text: Many of us know how tough red wine is to get out. When I spilled a few drops on my light colored shirt and pants a few weeks ago at an office reception I was pretty worried.A coworker loaned me a Tide to Go however, and after about 3 applications, most of the wine was gone. What tiny bit remained visible came out in the wash. That made me a believer and I have bought several for the office, home and on the go.
