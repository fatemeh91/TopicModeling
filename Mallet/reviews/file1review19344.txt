review/text: I bought this for my 2 year old who is potty training. We went through 3 other covers until we finally found this. I couldn't be happier with how it works. It's water proof with out feeling like you're sleeping on a plastic bag. It has a nice cushion and has been very durable. For affordable price and fast shipping. Will get the bigger size when we upgrade beds.
