review/text: I am a foster mother and one of my children takes 5 pills a day at different times, so I thought this was the answer to organizing them. I was wrong. The organizer is difficult. Each of the days comes in a box with 4 different compartments. The morn, noon, dinner, bedtime. These are not marked dark enough so they are hard to read. Each box has a label of the day of the week on it, but only on one side of the box, hence, pain in the but putting them back in the container right. You organize your days by putting the boxes in the box. You have to remove the correct box and open it each time you need a pill, then like a puzzle, put it back in the right spot, with the lettering on top. I would just rather open his pill bottle, it is much easier.
