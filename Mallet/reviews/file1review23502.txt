review/text: I love love love Heathers peppermint capsules for my IBS. So i figured this is a fiber I can trust. WRONG! I only did the 1 dose of half a teaspoon. I couldn't even do the second one to get a full dose in for the day. I had cramping and nausea and felt ill so badly i couldn't stand straight. I thought well maybe it's just me. My fiance tried it who has no stomach issues and has no issue with fiber at all. In fact I swear his stomach is like a goat. He can endure anything well not this fiber. He took the same amount as me and had the same reaction. We both swore off this fiber and threw the whole can away. Waste of money for me and him. And he is the type that will eat something again that made him sick before. Sorry but I will never order this fiber again.
