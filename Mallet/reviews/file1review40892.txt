review/text: WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A PRODUCT FOR A SPECIAL JOB, like your back is itching and it need scratching or you want to put medication on your back or the heel of your foot or the back of your thighs and legs and can't reach those body parts...you need help, you need a good helper, a dependable helper.I like this applicator because it is a highly likeable design, one can put meds or lotions on and then simple snap out the head on the applicator and wash it with soap and water and put it back on in a snap.The lotion or med smooths onto the body like paint on a wall.The only thing I think needs to be imporved is maybe the size of the roller but they may have tested things and found that a better application of meds or lotion occurs with a smaller head. I like this product! It fits in my desk drawer at work because it folds.
