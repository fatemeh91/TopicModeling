review/text: I have been using gillette products for 40 years. These Fusion blades do not klast 5 shaves the green strip turns white and the blades are not that sharp. You get about 5 good shaves and then forget it.I am moving to an electric shaver because these blades don't last like previous blades from 2 years ago that Gillette made.They are expensive and they do not give yu many shaves.
