review/text: As a man, and having sensitive skin and a tough beard also, I suffer from the worst of both worlds!!!. Thanks to these razors, I get a close shave and my skin goes unaffected and is left smooth for the wife to touch. I only see that you can only get a few good shaves from each razor and then it is basically showing wear and not shaving close enough. While everything else in the world has cheapened up, so has the metal we use in the US. But, for the money, it is the best manual razor I feel out there. I subscribe to auto delivery and save additional money right through Amazon. These razors in a 4 pack at Walmart are $15.97 and I pay $10.38 from Amazon with auto delivery, so why not!. With these tough economical times, why not save a dollar and I wrote this to let other people know about this deal that is available. Thank You.
