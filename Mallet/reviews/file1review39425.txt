review/text: I ordered this massager because I had read great reviews about it. To my surprise, when I received it, it was a different model. I paid $20 extra for this model because I wanted something of quality for my girlfriend. The model they actually sent me I could have got for $20 cheaper from EBay. I feel cheated and like I was ripped off. I contacted the vender and when I told them of this they simply cut off communication and no longer answered my emails.
