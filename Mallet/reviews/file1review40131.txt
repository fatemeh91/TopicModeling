review/text: I started exercising more at home (P90X), and needed a good mat to work out mat for our hardwood floors. The Valeo Yoga Kit does the trick with a pretty big mat and good cushioning. It's the same thickness as the other "generic" mats out there, but it comes complete with a strap, bag, and 2 yoga blocks (which you use in P90X).My only gripe is the ridiculous purple color (not very manly). But it does the trick. The only other thing is the initial slight chemical smell of the mat. Of course, it fades over time. I'd recommend airing it out when you receive it.
