review/text: My husband was always forgetting to take his meds and forgetting to check his diabetes. This nifty thing has 4 alarms for meds and 2 extra for whatever you want. He doesn't forget his meds anymore and he checks his sugar! I can load a whole weeks worth of meds into the tray and remove them one day at a time. I just love it!
