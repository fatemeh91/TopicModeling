review/text: This is dull, cheap steel and the local knife shop couldn't even hone it. I cut myself trying to use it, and have relegated it to opening mail. These people should be forced to shave their entire bodies with this piece of garbage. A butter knife gives a better shave.Do not buy this for any reason.
