review/text: This sweeper really does do a surprisingly good job picking up small debri for in-between cleanings. My only complaint (and it's a big one!) is that the handle is in three pieces that WILL NOT stay together. I am constantly dropping part of the handle and putting it back together while using it. I finally got fed up and put some glue reinforced by tape around the sections. If not for that it would get 5 stars!
