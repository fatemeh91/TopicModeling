review/text: Sure Clear deodorant worked as well as Secret, the deodorant I've used for years. Previously other deodorant products had caused a rash, but since Sure Clear was unscented no problem occurred. My husband also tested the product but he did break out with a rash and discontinued the test. I did a price comparison check and Sure Clear was less expensive then Secret. So I plan to switch and have recommended the product to other family members.
