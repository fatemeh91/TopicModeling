review/text: These automatic or painless tweezers (they call them different things) are a personal favorite. My hands shakes slightly from carpal tunnel and these making doing my eyebrows much easier. They are easy to use and grip the hair for easy removal. Another great product by Tweezerman. I'm always happy with the products I buy from this company.Tweezerman tweezers are worth the extra money. You can buy cheaper tweezers, but they won't work as well or hold up as long as a pair of tweezerman.I have found that each pair of these I have bought outlast my keeping up with them by far. They remain sharp and remove hair/splinter/etc easily. They grip well and are easy to handle.The only down side I have found is my own fault and that's misplacing them or someone borrowing them and finding them equally great and never returning them.To clean them I always soak them for a minute or so in alcohol it removes and oils and kills germs.Love the product and always come back to them.
