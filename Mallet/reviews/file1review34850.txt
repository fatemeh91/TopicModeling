review/text: I am not sure there's any thing in this patch other than the glue that makes the skin itches for a long time even after you quit using them.then it's so weired that you will not find any of information about on it on the web, and there no customer service contacts for them anywhere.you're really better of buysing the real thing from walgreen or cvs, and make it worth it.
