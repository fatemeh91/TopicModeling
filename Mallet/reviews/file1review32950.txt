review/text: I foundWellesse Joint Movement Glucosamine With Chondroitin and Msm 33.8 fl oz (1000works great at keeping joint issues at bay. If I start to feel pain or discomfort I realize it's been awhile since I've taken any. Once I resume the pain subsides usually within a few days to a couple weeks. I have large German Shepherd Dogs - they love the taste and it helps resolve the older dogs' joint stiffness. If it tasted better or they used fewer ingredients like Sucralose I would increase to a 5 star rating.
