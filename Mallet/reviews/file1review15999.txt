review/text: Stay far away from this product. The design of the head allows bactaria to stay in the brush head of the product....that's right...the part you put in your mouth. Current owners can remove the brush head and see the black gunk that builds up under the brush head and into the upper handle part. Do yourself a favor, buy the SonicCare, or at least the better Oral B product that has a sealed head.
