review/text: I have been taking these vitamins for 2 months now and haven't found anything negative to say. It's easy to remember to take one a day and they don't have a funky taste/smell. I haven't felt sick at all from them either. I am also taking an extra calcium supplement (as you would need to do with most any prenatal vitamin, I think) and a little more iron (since I am deficient). Also, I have added Omega 3 Fatty acids (fish oil) to my diet--some prenatal vitamins are starting to include this as it may help brain development.
