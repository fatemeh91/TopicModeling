review/text: The pluses - it was comfortable, reasonably priced. The minus was that it did not cover enough of my thumb to be of use to keep my "trigger thumb" from bending - which hurts a lot. I have a small hand, I ordered the small size, but the thumb part didn't extend high enough to immobilize my thumb. I did not return it because after just one day's wear, the stitching was coming loose at the top of the thumb sleeve so I just skipped it. For anyone with this problem, just wrap your thumb with about two turns of that self-sticking bandage wrap stuff that's available in different widths - I use 1" - and is flesh tone which frankly looks better than a bright blue thing that everyone feels compelled to ask you about. Unless you like that sort of thing!
