review/text: While it does do its job when used properly, as a distance runner and weight lifter, it just got a bit too much for me to use. The appetite control was NOT good for me, as I desperately needed calories. And if you didn't drink 1-2 gallons of water a day, you were definitely dehydrated. The thermogenic also worked quite well, but was sometimes uncomfortable. However, as a supplement, it does exactly as it should when used properly.
