review/text: When the wax is placed under warm running water, it softens from a heavy syrup to a consistency like dripping honey. Then it thickens slightly after placing it on the skin (there's a spatula included to aid in spreading the wax). It removed a good bit of hair from my legs. The process was not pain-free, but it didn't hurt as bad as some other products I've used in the past. This brand was actually less messy than the other brands on the market. My skin bruised slightly in the more tender areas of my legs, but if the hair stays off for a length of time, it's worth it. Not all of the hair came off my legs, and the kit didn't have a sufficient amount of sheets for hair removal. However, I'd say this is the best wax product on the market and I'll definitely buy this again.
