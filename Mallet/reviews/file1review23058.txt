review/text: I looked at the reviews for this sweeper and decided to get one. What a waste of money! It won't pick up much, a hair here or there, maybe. The brush is VERY soft. It would work great if the brush was stiffer so that it could grab on to the stuff on the floor. Oh well, you get what you pay for. As for the others who like it...
