review/text: I give this a 4 because of taste since I feel like it is very sweet. Unfortunately, I cannot say anything about growing out my hair because I am a bit slow (lol) and get my hair braided to wear a lace front. So I do not see my hair often enough to see length. I can speak on the growth of nails, and not so much that my nails are growing because my nails are naturally strong and grow, but I can tell there is a difference since I work in a lab and wear gloves all the time. My nails used to get soft and flimsy right out of the gloves and now they are still firm coming out of the gloves and after being washed so many times.I also notice I am energetic. I work 12 hr shifts and used to drink Monsters and Rockstars for taste and energy often but now I rarely buy them. I can even get 5 hrs of sleep and still function at work for the 12 hrs without feeling insane.In the end, I feel this product works and I love that it is liquid because I am sure if there were a pill, it'd be horse size.
