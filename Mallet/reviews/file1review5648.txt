review/text: My wife has used both the Vitaminder Pill Case Stacker for her meds and theVitaminder Vitamin Dispenserfor her vitamins. She discovered the pill case stacker was perfect for keeping her small pierced earrings and rings separated when we travelled. Never mind the expensive leather jewelry travel case that I bought for her! By the way, she's a Gem too - but I couldn't quite fit her in the pill stacker! ~ The Boss
