review/text: I have been using my trimmer for about ten months now and it is still going strong. I purchased it because i like to shave in the shower. I just put another one in my basket as this is something that I will want to have for a long time. The battery holds a charge for a long time although I only use it about once a week. The trick to using this product is to use it almost exclusively as a wet razor. It requires soap or shampoo but gets a good close shave on my head and has attachments for beard length and blending. I am hairy but well trimmed. I use it as a whole body trimmer. It looks a little cheap but it is actually pretty durable. Again, it does not work well as a dry razor. But lather up this is smooth and efficient.
