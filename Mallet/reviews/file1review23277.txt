review/text: We use this sweeper on our flat rugs AND bare floors to pick up cat litter, cat hair (did I mention that we have cats?), and human crumbs. It works perfectly and quickly, collecting a surprising amount of debris. And you don't have to go over and over the same area. The handle components occasionally have to be re-tightened but I have not had any problem with the handle coming apart. I cannot say how this might work on carpets or shaggier rugs.
