review/text: This is not a product I would get again. One bottle is 20 pills and you need to take 2 pills five times a day. That is way too much pill taking for me. If I'm getting sick, the last thing I want to do is think about taking pills that many times a day. And it only covers you for one time of being sick. I did test it when I felt a cold coming on and it did nothing to defend against it.They do a good job of detailing what is in the product though, I give them that.
