review/text: Our bathroom sink and tub both had extremely slow drains. We tried various chemicals and they did not help. I was about to ask a plumber to use a drain jetter (a high pressure water spray at the end of a flexible tube) to clear it out, when I saw this and decided to give it a try.It worked on the first try. I have 6 more charges left in the system. The cost per use is trivial, way cheaper than using chemicals. The only complaint I have is that it has some kind of "fresh scent". If they got rid of that, this would be a 5 star product.
