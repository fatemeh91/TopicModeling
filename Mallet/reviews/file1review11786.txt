review/text: I just received my HUGE canister of whey protein and really like it so far...only I can't seem to find the scoop! Does one come in the package? If so, how big is the scoop? A tablespoon? Teaspoon? I don't have a way of measuring out 32 grams, lol :) Otherwise, the taste is great, which makes me happy because I'm really picky!
