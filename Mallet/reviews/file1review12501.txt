review/text: Bought this product a month ago. Decided to purchase it because I don't normally have daily bowel movement. I considered the price to be very high. The first day I tried the product, I experienced severe case of diarrhea and stomach cramps. Nothing weird came out of me but the frequent diarrhea was bad enough for me to handle.I gave the product 3 stars just because it did help me release some of the "junk" that I had inside my body for not having daily bowel movement. But I would say this product is definately not for everyone. I have quit taking the pills. Instead, I have been eating more fruit, vegetables, and drink plenty of water. They can actually help you to have regular bowel movement naturally, without depending on this type of product.I read articles on WebMd, and most doctors don't even recommend this type of product because they believe that every human body is capable of releasing bowel movement on its own.So the question is, do we really need this type product or do we just think we need it?
