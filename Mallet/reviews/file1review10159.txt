review/text: I ordered the vanilla butter cream and got vanilla so the order was wrong. And while I will drink it if I have to, there are such better-tasting products on the market, why use this one? I find myself using all the others I have and reordering those. This one sits on the shelf.You might think it silly to complain about taste when really we take these products to get fit -- but try doing this twice a day and you will eventually start dreading drinking this. We suffer enough in workouts. Why not at least enjoy some of these supplements?
