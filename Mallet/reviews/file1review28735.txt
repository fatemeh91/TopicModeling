review/text: I bought the double chocolate cause it's on sale and I've read a lot of good things about ON. To me the taste is nothing to write home about, pretty much the same as other brands. It sits real well in my stomach after drinking it ... I'm lactose intolerant and some other brands upset my stomach a bit, no problem whatsoever is Gold Standard. I'll probably stick to this brand.
