review/text: After trying to conceive for a year, becoming pregnant and then miscarrying, I decided this time around I would try Fertilaid in hopes of speeding the conception process. I experienced GREAT results withFertileCM: for Fertile Cervical Mucus(I highly recommend it, btw!) so I figured even if this didn't help, it couldn't hurt. WRONG! I went from regular (28-30 day) periods and ovulating, to just the opposite! I haven't ovulated in 2 months and my cycles are all out of whack! After reading the other reviews, I fear Fertilaid is to blame. I have quit taking it and hope to be "normal" again soon!Having said that, for irregular cycles it may be worth a shot. My cousin tried this (she doesn't ovulate or menstruate regularly) and she got her first positive ovulation test while on this product. She didn't get pregnant, but it gave her hope that maybe soon she will be.So to summarize...Regular cycles: proceed with caution! Or don't proceed at all!Irregular cycles: It could be worth a shot.
