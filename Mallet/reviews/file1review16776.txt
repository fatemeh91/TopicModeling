review/text: I have fibromyalgia and multiple chemical sensitivities, so I need to avoid excess chemical exposure. This includes flouride, which is potentially dangerous in large amounts and which I was over-exposed to as a kid through fluoridated drinking water and toothpaste. Weleda is by far the best fluoride-free natural toothpaste I've found. Salt and baking soda are just abrasive enough to really get all the plaque and crud off my teeth, without damaging the enamel. My teeth have never felt cleaner!
