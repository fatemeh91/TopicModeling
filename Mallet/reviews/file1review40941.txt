review/text: I started taking these pills three days ago. While they were not what I wanted (I wanted just green tea pills, not a mixature), I decided to give them a try. After three restless nights I traced it back to these pills. Each pill has 200 mg of caffeine. And by following the directions, which state to take one pill mid morning followed by a pill and a glass of water. Then to repeat it again in mid afternoon. I was pumping myself full of 400 mg of caffeine. These pills are not worth it.
