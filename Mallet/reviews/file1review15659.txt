review/text: The old cruisers were much better. The new improved ones are not &quot;improved&quot; at all. I agree with Ferrety4 in the last review. This Grandma got a sample pack of the &quot;improved&quot; Cruisers, it was enough to steer me clear!I want to spend time with my Grandson rather than doing laundry because of some silly purple striped diaper leaking! Take it from a Granny who has 3 sons and 1 Grandson........Purple is not good for males no matter what their age!!!
