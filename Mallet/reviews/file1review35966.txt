review/text: Very happy with the quality of this product. I was unable to get my local supply which of course is extremely fresh. I bought this based on the favorable reviews. Very happy to use this as a good substitute. Your best bet as far as bee pollen is to find a good quality local provider. If you are not able to, I can endorse this product.
