review/text: I like Dr. Bob's Portable Neck Traction a lot. I have used it successfully to significantly reduce pain when my neck was out of alignment. I was also able to completely eliminate my adult son's neck problems with it--in one treatment for him! Before using the device, it helps a lot to warm the neck muscles for about 10-15 minutes with moist heat. Also, according to a physical therapist I was seeing, the maximum length of time a muscle will stretch is 30 seconds, so I apply and release the pressure by inflating and deflating the neck traction device. It requires a little fussing around to do it that way, but it works really well. I highly recommend this product and have had no problems with leakage of the air pressure.
