review/text: It may not make for a whole lot but I throw in a pair of disposable earplugs. Say you had to blow that single whistle (all day ...--...), your ears would be ringing so bad it could hinder your rescue and possibly cause permanent hearing damage. Some may argue the other end of that logic, just my 2 cents tho. Also D.doctor "The white cord is supposedly for fishing" FYI, Doug states on his web site[...] , that the 50 ft. of #69 Black Nylon Thread / Fishing Line: This is heavy-duty nylon thread, not cheaper and weaker polyester. At a minimum of 10.5 lb. (4.8 kg) test, it is strong enough to double as fishing line. I've caught some nice sized fish using this line and the rest of the fishing gear in the kit.
