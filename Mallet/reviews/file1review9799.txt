review/text: Bought these for my first aid kit for splinters, etc... They're better than all other brands, but not the best over all.Fortunately, unlike the 1 and 2 star reviewers, I'm not cursed with scab-covered ingrown hairs all over my body. But I do get occasional random slivers of random crap under my fingernails, in my finger tips, etc... And when I do, I like to use the Tweezerman Petite Tweezer Set instead:http://www.amazon.com/Tweezerman-Petite-Tweezer-Leather-Case/dp/B000WI1WAM/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&s;=beauty&qid;=1272973122&sr;=8-6The fine tweezers in the petite set are sharper than these yellow suckers. They are also more compact and come in a protective case that will keep the tips from getting bent. Two features that are very beneficial for both backpacking and camping first aid kits. The set is a little more pricey, but well worth it if these are going in your first aid kit.
