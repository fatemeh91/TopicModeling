review/text: This shaver packs more power into a cordless shaver than I've ever gotten from a Panasonic or Norelco; it's powerful enough that holding it while shaving can numb your fingers from the motor's vibration. However, the shaver foils fail too soon, and usually while I'm shaving the top of my head, which means I end up getting a nice gash cut in my scalp about once a month.Wahl needs to put some R&D; into toughening up its foils. Be prepared to spend $15 a quarter on replacement foils.
