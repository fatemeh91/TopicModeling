review/text: Everyone has been singing the praises of Omega 3 and fish oil. This is another way to supplement that provides Omega 3 benefits and a little variety as well. It has a bit fishier smell when taking, but no bad aftertaste or burping (like happens with cod liver oil sometimes). The fact that it is one step further down the food chain is an interesting concept - not to mention that the availability of krill is much higher than fish (kinda like grass vs beef :)).Twinlabs has a good reputation as a dependable lab.
