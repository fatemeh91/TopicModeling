review/text: My husband is usually the one who gets hit the hardest with colds and illness when the house gets sick. He's often the only one who gets sick and almost always the one who stays sick the longest. So, when the kids woke up sick one day it was no wonder that by that evening he was starting to feel a little off. He immediately began taking this, and not even at the recommend dosage, and it completely passed him!! He never did end up getting sick. I, on the other hand, am nursing a newborn and the package clearly stated not to take while pregnant or nursing and so was unable to take these..yup, I got sick, and it wasn't pretty. I'll definitely keep these in the cabinet for him, just in case! ;)
