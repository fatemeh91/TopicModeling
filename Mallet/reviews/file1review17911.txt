review/text: Seems to work well. I bought it because sometime I wake up with a raw throat in the morning and think it's from snoring during the night. I bought these hoping they would slow down any snoring I may be doing. As I said I sleep alone so I don't know if they are doing the job or not, but I don't seem to have the raw throat anymore in the mornings.
