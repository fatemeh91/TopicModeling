review/text: I have never purchase a pill splitter before but I can tell you about my experience with this one. It is convivent and safe. I like the no slip orange padding and the area to storage cut pills. I can easily keep this item in my purse for use anywhere and have no concerns about safety or losing pills. I am cutting very small pills and it can be a little challenging but I feel like this would be the case with any pill cutter.
