review/text: If you're looking for something that seriously suppresses your appetite then this product probably isn't what you're looking for. It does take the edge off but I found it didn't completely take away my hunger and especially when I have PMS.There are some really good things about it though. I usually loathe instant coffee but this stuff actually tastes pretty good and best of all, it's portable. You can take the packets anywhere you go. Even if you're male, you could still stick a couple of them in your wallet.I have lost about 25lbs and I use this about twice a day. It does take the edge off my appetite, doesn't give me jitters at all or interfere with my sleep and even though I'm not actively "dieting" right now, it does seem to help me burn fat and has helped me keep the weight off.Bottom line: Not a tremendous help in suppressing appetite but it does help you burn fat and gives you extra energy without that jittery feeling. Also, very portable and tastes good.
