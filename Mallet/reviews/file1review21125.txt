review/text: Very confusing.I ordered the automatic switch and received what is apparently a manual switch. You have to hold the switch down or it turns off.The box clearly states Automatic switch yet the manual clearly states that it is a manual momentary switch.I also bought mine through who Amazon lists as DAB which turned out to be Potential Dynamix LLC.Also what I received was an open box, which was quite worn looking, was literally open and there no shrink wrap or tape. The end of the box was crushed yet Amazon had shipped it an oversized box so they had to have tossed this obviously worn, not sealed box as the lid was 1/2 way open.I was told by customer service that if I wanted a brand new unit I should buy it from Amazon.com not from a 3rd party with fulfillment by Amazon.com very confusing to me, I assumed that fullfillment by Amazon.com meant I would receive a new product in a factory sealed box. Apparently not the case. Also as this is a personal use item I would think it would be illegal to sell such used!I have not experience with how this heating pad works as I am not going to handle it unless I have a new one.
