review/text: I have been using Poliquin Primal Greens for the last few months, and I asked a friend for a less expensive alternative. On hisrecommendation, I tried green vibrance. There are tons of great reviews. I don't get it. The taste was awful. My wife, son and Iall tried this and there was no comparison. So I am returning it. I dont know if this was a bad batch (thought I doubt it), but I cannotunderstand how anyone could stomach this product, despite the health benefits.
