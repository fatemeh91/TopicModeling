review/text: Have been using Method Daily shower spray for years and loved it. My last "subscribe and save" shipment arrived with new bottle design and a"new formula". This new formula is horrible. It leaves what looks like water streaks on all the surfaces in my shower. I hate it and now have 7 bottles of something that I will not use--not to mention being out what I paid for this shipment. I cannot believe that the company actually thought this was an improvement!! Did they not test it on some real showers??? Please bring back the old formula!!!!!
