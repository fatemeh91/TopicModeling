review/text: I had hoped the Panasonic brand trimmer would live up to both the high esteem that I hold for Pansonic brand electronics and also the excellent ratings by other reviewers. My trimmer initially seemed like it might be a good product but after a month or so it began to work erratically and by the end of two months is not working at all. Also, when it did work it was very uncomfortable as it often pulled rather than cut hairs. I would not purchase this if I had it to do over. I gave it three stars but that is probably an inflated score.
