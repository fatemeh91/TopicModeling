review/text: Not only do I love Kool n Fit, I'm going to go spray some on as soon as I'm done here! It's a great product for aches, pains, bruises and tired, overworked muscles. If you can't have a massage, this is the next best thing! Use it even if you can have a massage. It is very economical, spray or splash all around the painful area, not just where it hurts. And don't rub it in, let it air dry. Keep it away from broken skin and keep your undies on when applying. I believe it is the best analgesic there is: works great, easy to use, not greasy and smells good! Gotta go--it's waiting for me.Kathryn Merrow - The Pain Relief Coach
