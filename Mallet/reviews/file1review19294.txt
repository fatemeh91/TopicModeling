review/text: It's my obligation to say Thank You to this product and give them a positive review! I have near normal sperm count but the doctor says he is worried about my sperm morphology(I forgot the nos.). I tried this product, around September, before we start IUI/IVF. Our start of IUI was this month(Jan. 2011), we already have the medicines we need for the IUI. But guess what, we don't need the IUI anymore. MY WIFE IS PREGNANT, 6 weeks! :) I don't know if the my sperm count and morphology has improved coz I did not do sperm test(I am pissed doing the process). There's no harm in trying this product. Gob Bless and good luck...
