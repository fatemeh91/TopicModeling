review/text: A friend of mine gave me a few packets of this- 2 chocolate and one orignal vanilla. the consistency is very thick, so I recommend using only half a packet- as it will fill you up. I tried the chocolate at first- mixed it with chocolate soy and it was tasty but as I stated very thick because I used the whole packet. My friend told me that the vanilla tasted like cake batter- I'm not a true vanilla fan, but this is soooooooooooooooo good... I mix 1/2 a packet with some vanilla soy and it tasted like pancake batter- but not too sweet. I supplement this as a snack or meal (lunch). I'm trying to lose 10lbs and using this product with eating fresh fruits and salads will surely get me there. I'm full, satisfied with no shaky or hungry feeling. Yummy, yum, yum... You'll love it!!!Use 1/2 of a packet with 8 oz of soy or skim milk. A Full packet is very thick. I used a shaker bottle for about a minute and it was the perfect consistency.
