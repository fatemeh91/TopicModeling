review/text: My temperature had been below 96 degrees and I was having a hard time losing weight. After looking at Dr. Oz's page, I found out about Guggul and did my research and decided to give this product a try...WELL my temperature is now between 97-98 degrees and I have lost 4 pounds and it's been a week since I started taking it. Very pleased with the results so far. I have added Ginger tea and cayenne pills to the mix as well and made some adjustments to my diet based on some information I found on Dz. Oz's page. The delivery was very fast too!
