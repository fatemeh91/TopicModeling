review/text: This showed up on time and this waaay cheaper here then it is on Optimum Nutrition's site. This kind doesn't make my stomach hurt like other protein powders. Also it tastes & mixes better too, it doesn't get in nasty clumpy chunks in the shaker cup. I'm not in love with the price, but i really don't know where you would get this any cheaper.
