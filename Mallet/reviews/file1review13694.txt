review/text: This foot massager is not for the weak of heart. This thing is very powerful; so powerful that it hurts sometimes. The hard plastic bumps are not comfortable in the least. The first one we got was broken. The vibration wasn't working correctly so the company sent us another one and we returned the broken one all free of charge. Although, it did take a while to convince them that it was broken. I can't use it because it hurts my feet, but my wife likes it and she sometimes props it up and uses it on her back. Overall, I think it's over priced. I'm not sure that we ever got it to heat up and the IR, is a joke if you ask me. It's come down in price since we bought it, but I still don't think it's worth $100.
