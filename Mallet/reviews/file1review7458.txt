review/text: I became acquainted with walkers & rollators after my husband's heart attack - and found out that mobility was going to be 'key' to improving his health. A wheeled walker - rollator - answered this need. Since that time I also suffered a back injury and found out first hand that all rollators are not created equal. The first decision to consider is 'where am I going to be using this walker most? Indoors/housebound? Or for transport in and out of a vehicle - to the store, clinic, etc. Either way you will most likely prefer a lightweight and easily transportable device and this D-Lite model fits the bill. Indoors, the swivel wheels make it a God-send for turning in tight locations. Outdoors 8" swivel wheels are a must for maneuverability especially in snowy areas. The only place I fault this D-lite model is on the quality of the wheel for use outdoors. In my experience the rollators having the 'gray/white' rubber wheel have proved to have more traction and be the more durable wheel. The removable basket is a great convenience and this rollator also has an excellent seat and back rest. One last note: if you are outdoors more than in or traveling over rough or uneven ground - you will want to compare the Cosco Ability Care Traveler (or Cruiser with backrest) Style Rollator.
