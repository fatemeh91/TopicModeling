review/text: I needed a protein supplement to add to my diet and after reading the Consumer Reports item on protein powders containing heavy metals I was cautious to buy one that contained no heavy metals and Solgar's fit the bill. The taste isn't great, but that is not important to me. Very satisfied with the product and take it daily.
