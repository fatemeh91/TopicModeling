review/text: I am not a fan of green veggies, but realize they are important to health and well being. I searched for supplements and decided to go with this one based on the user reviews. I feel much better and have more energy now! I'm pretty much a skeptic so I was shocked at the difference! The taste is not that bad. I mix it with 4 ounces of oj and 2 ounces of water. It isn't a sipping drink so knock it back in a two or three swallows! I'll definitely keep buying.
