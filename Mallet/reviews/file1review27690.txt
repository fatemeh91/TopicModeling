review/text: This is the best protein powder that I have consumed compared to other similar products. I did some research on the type of protein that is good for muscle building and everyday consumption and found a lot of information about whey protein. I researched different brands and found Optimum Nutrition very popular. I feel good after drinking protein shakes. I got the best deal on Amazon for a 5 lbs protein powder tub. I am so happy with the product that I have signed up for frequent automatic shipments.
