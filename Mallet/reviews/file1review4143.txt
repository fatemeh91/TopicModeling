review/text: After getting my prime membership I realized that I can get a lot of everyday items here on amazon.com with free shipping and at a very reasonable cost. So one of those items turned out to be the ever so expensive (at the grocery store) razor blades. I for one dread the day I have to run to the store and spend close to $30 on razor blades, I find it to be so expensive and outrageous that it offends me. Of course in comes amazon with a great price on a package of 8 blades for a great price, under $20 and free shipping, that's nearly $2.50 per each razor blade. Truly a great deal, I even saved 15% extra because I signed up for an automatic re-order in 6 mnths. Go amazon!
