review/text: The service was good and the product is as described, but there is one reason I'm rating it with two stars. I had similar thing and I wasn't happy with it, because it often slipped off my belt (it had a belt clip) or the clip slipped off the case.This one is with loop, but the seller (and the photo) doesn't tell you, that this loop has button, which unbuttons relatively easy and the result is the same - you can easily lose the thing.One more drawback that all the similar products have - the case doesn't protect the lighter very well - the front button may scratch it, because (part of it) appears inside the pouch.
