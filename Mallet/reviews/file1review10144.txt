review/text: The photo provided is very deceiving - it looks like you are getting 5 PACKS of bags. In fact you are receiving 5 individual bags. I was surprised to receive only five bags for the price charged - making them much more expensive than what I could purchase at a home improvement store or even the grocery store! Will not make that mistake again. The bags are high quality lawn bags, but I can buy the exact thing (and same number) for less than half price at the grocery store.
