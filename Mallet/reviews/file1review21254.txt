review/text: This is a really great toothbrush. I'm the son of a dentist, so I was taught at an early age the "proper" way to brush your teeth. Well, after the VERY first time I used the Oral B S-200, my teeth felt more clean than my regular toothbrush ever got them, and felt more like they do right after coming from the dentist for a cleaning! This is a great product that is priced well, and well worth the purchase.I think my favorite feature is the built in timer that pulses the toothbrush every 30 seconds so you know to switch to a different part of your mouth. My only complaint is that it's hard to brush your tongue with, but my tongue scraper takes care of that just fine.
