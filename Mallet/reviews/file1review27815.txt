review/text: After having used the CVS brand whey flavored cookies and cream, I almost yelled for joy after trying this. The flavor is great!! Doesn't have this overly-artificial sweetener taste, mixes easily and it's actually yummy. And the price? Beats much of the competition including CVS brand. So glad to have discovered this product. Highly recommend!!
