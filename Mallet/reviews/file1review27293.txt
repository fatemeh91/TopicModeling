review/text: If you're like me you don't like wasting money on useless supplements. I spent over $300 a month trying lots of Different products and after almost a year of testing this product, ISO-pure zero carb, and ON 100% casein are all I use. Yeah you could spend more but why? I use this for bulking along with maltodextrin. Now food sells big 12 lb bags as a complex carb.
