review/text: I thought I was buying a duplicate of the shaver that was stolen from my motel room when I was on a business trip. The one I had to replace was very good, but this one is even better.I have a very tough beard (I typically use the electric shaver before taking a shower, then a traditional hot lather-and-blade shave afterwards). This shaver gives me a close enough shave that I really don't need to use the blade to have a better-than-passable shave. In addition, the charge seems to last forever.After decades of using Norelcos, I highly recommend this model Remington.
