review/text: We've been trying for 15months for baby #2 to no avail; two rounds of Clomid didn't help either. I've known abt Fertilaid for a while now so I finally decided to give it a try- am very regular with my periods.I calculated my fertile days and started taking fertilaid one week before that and YEP it worked. I couldn't believe it when I got a ++ on two tests. I didn't finish the whole bottle.Please give it a try, it really works and it's ALL NATURAL.
