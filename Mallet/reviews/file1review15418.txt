review/text: My hair was very damaged from bleaching, the dryer, and flat iron. After using this shampoo for about 6 weeks, my hair dresser says my hair is in great shape and has remained so with regular use for about six months now.Trouble is this shampoo has been discontinued. So you must purchase from amazon or else where if you want it.
