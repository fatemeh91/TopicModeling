review/text: Great shaver however the battery sucks! After few months with minimal use, the battery no longer charges, so now I have to throw it out. I am sick and tired of this stupid approach to making products - make a weak product so that it can break fast and sell them cheap so people can buy them every 4 months. This is BS, I would rather pay more for a better product so that I don't contribute to the pollution of the Earth. Not buying another shaver from Remington, although the trimmer was excellent.
