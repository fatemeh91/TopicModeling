review/text: I bought the product at GNC. They explained it was one of the most popular weight loss products they have...and guaranteed that it worked! After a week, I gained weight! My stomach and waistline had ballooned. I think I experienced water weight gain from taking the pill and even my face got fat! I stopped taking it and just decided to diet/excercise. 565% weight loss? not for me...and you should return your bottle too.
