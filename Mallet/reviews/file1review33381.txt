review/text: Love these blades! Although everyone recommends the sharper Feather blades I am more than content! After a decade of ingrown hairs, skin irritation, and razor bumps with cartridge razors I will never turn back! I have tried double, triple, four, and even five bladed razors (disposable razors and cartridge razors) I can now say that my face is happy!
