review/text: I just recently had to replace my last ADC ADSCOPE and it broke my heart, i had it for six years, had i not been leaving it out in my car in the arizona sun i doubt it would have met the end it did, because of the sun damage this winter the tubing froze and broke, (just dont hang any stethoscope in your car) i work as a paramedic and much prefer ADC over any other brand, i have gone threw a Littman or two and for the enviroment i work in the ADC was far superior for hearing over a diesel engine, i did use a littman on occasion when also working as a tech in the clinical setting, as its better in a "quieter" enviroment, but in the ride i had to pile linen under the arm to hear the bp and not just road/engine, and i just plain dont like the electronic ones, but hey when the poo hits the fan most people are happy to use what ever stethoscope is closest to them (even the $2 disposables lol), so really in the end it comes down to what you will be using it for and what you can afford. they all have their place, really i have been reading these reviews and i think sometimes its only the brand/price getting reviewed and not the actual product, if your looking for a affordable, reliable in any setting stethoscope in my opinion i highly recommend you try ADC
