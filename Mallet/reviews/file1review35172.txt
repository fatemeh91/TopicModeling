review/text: I am in agreement with the delicious theme. It is my favorite flavor of all the Glucerna bars and I cannot for the life of me figure out why my local grocery doesn't keep it on the shelves. Tough for me to stop at one myself. As of this post, though, the price can't be beat [undercutting American Diabetes Association wholesale connection ... I checked.]
