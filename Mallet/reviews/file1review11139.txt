review/text: These rollers kind of defeat the purpose. I am constantly ripping off sheets because it appears to have little pick-up ability. Does not pick-up pet hairs very well. Now I am stuck with a box of these. I will never buy this brand roller again. The rollers from Jos. A. Bank have the best pick-up I have found.
