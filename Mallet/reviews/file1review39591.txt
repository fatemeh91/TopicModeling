review/text: This review is an update on a previous one. I've owned 4Readers glasses for several years. They are great looking, great lenses, frames and best of all, priced great, which means about once a year I can afford to replace a few lost, sat on, etc, pairs. This time when I ordered, my order got filled by Amazon with another, Much cheaper product, which I returned. And complained about of course. 4Reader customer service actually called me because it was such a bizarre story, they wanted to hear it in person. I was able to send them the link to the order and once they saw that indeed I used their link but another company called Saving Guatemala Kids, got the order, they took great care of me. It is still a mystery how the other company got the order, filled it and actually accepted the return, but I now have the correct glasses on the way. I read some reviews who sounded like they got the same glasses in that weird window of time, if so, you need to let 4Reader customer service know about it. I'm sure they are still as confused as I but it looks like the link is fixed. Happy reading!
