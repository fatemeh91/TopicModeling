review/text: I like this anti-perspirant a lot. It's very effective and it really helps to protect against odor and wetness. It also has an anti-stain formulation, which is important for your clothes. The only thing I don't like is the sweet, powdery scent, but fortunately it fades in no time. Maybe a more fresh or a minty smell would help, especially for men. I recommend it for active people, but also for anybody who's looking for a good, effective anti-perspirant.
