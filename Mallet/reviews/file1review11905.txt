review/text: This brace was effective for a time. The problem I had was that the elastic broke down quickly. The brack began to lose it's form and bunch up. As this occurred, the overall strength of the brace diminished and provided less and less support. I like this type brace for providing passive support of the tendons along the arch and bottom of the foot. This particular item from this particular manufacturer did not satisfy my needs entirely.
