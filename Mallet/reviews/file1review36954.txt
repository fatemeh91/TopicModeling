review/text: Duro-Med Mboss Sock and Stocking Aid with Ridges, BlueThe Duro Med Mboss Sock aid I would give it a 3 out of 4. A couple minor problems. One when you go to pull your sock on the ropes can slip through the clips as your pulling' so be sure to check them from time to time. Also the sock aid very rarely will pull the sock up over your heal. If your socks do not have the elasticity they used to it will pull them up father. My good socks it gets them up to the heal which is far enough for me to be able to get them.
