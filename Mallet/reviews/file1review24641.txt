review/text: an extra push. I didn't see it as a helpful dietary supplement. I was mostly hyper all day, with no weight loss.Earlier this month, I was preparing to move and I needed more energy, I took two blue Zantrex-3 pills and I was up for at least 24 hours. But when I came down, I basically crashed.During the two weeks I took the pills I did not see any weight loss results, but around 7pm at night, I would feel jittery, like I wanted to crawl out of my skin. In addition, my coworkers thought I was on illegal drugs because I was so wired.I decided to stop taking the capsules and have just been trying to fight the battle of the bulge with diet and exercise.
