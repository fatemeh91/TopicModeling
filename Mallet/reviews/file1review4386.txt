review/text: The Fusion has been one of my husband's favorite razor for some time. These blades are the best price I could find. It's much more convenient for me to order these online, save some money, and not have to go to the pharmacy area because the blades are locked up in my local drug store.I have continued to purchase the replacement cartridges through Amazon.
