review/text: Wonderful product. I have to say it is definitely my new favorite. The size is awesome, hits all the right spots. The rotator beads work very nicely, and the bullet in the rabbit is just amazing. The material it is made of is easily cleaned, a little on the hard side but still nice. It's the best in my opinion.
