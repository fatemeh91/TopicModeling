review/text: This was the first shave stick I've purchased, and I bought it based on comments made on badgerandblade.com. It's got a great peppery scent that I love. It's distinctive and surprisingly soothing. Sometimes I'll pick up and sniff the box when I'm in the bathroom. The scent left by the soap after the shave is subtle, so I make sure to use an unscented aftershave balm. Great for face lathering and has a pretty traditional foil wrap around the stick. The little plastic base makes it easy to handle. Speick makes a wide range of facial products all with the same scent. This will always be in my shave den.
