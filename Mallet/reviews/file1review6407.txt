review/text: I often have back spasms & keep this by my chair in the livingroom to use. May not use every day, but when I need it, it is a godsend! Instead of having to try to press out the spasm with a wall corner or begging my husband (who can never get it right), I use this & it really works. Bought a trigger point book also that helps me find the right place to press. If you have upper back spasms, shoulder spasms & don't mind taking charge of your problem, this item really is for you!
