review/text: My husband just loves this shower gel. I think it is great, too, for the price. It has a nice scent, cleans skin well without drying it out, rinses off well, and the pump always works without fail (we've gone through at least a dozen of these in the last few years). If I were crazy rich I would prefer a high-end shower gel with expensive ingredients like essential oils--the kind that smell out of this world, but of course, that would cost four times as much money so I usually only purchase those shower gels in small bottles for an occasional splurge. This Alba gel, however, is a great everyday alternative to bar soap (which can be messy and inconvenient, and make it harder to clean your shower/tub due to soap scum) and it is also a nice alternative to less expensive grocery store shower gels (which generally smell icky and artificial). The smell of this is clean and fresh, and it is good for both men and women.My only complaint is that the last couple bottles we bought did not have a clean/simple label with solely orange and white colors on it. It also had some silly looking lettering in pink which messes with the "decor minimalism" for those of us who care about that kind of thing. It is a minor infraction, to be sure, but something to take note of if you care about such things. :)
