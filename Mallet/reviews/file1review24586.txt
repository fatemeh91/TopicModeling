review/text: I took this for 2 weeks & threw the bottle out. It gave me a caffeine buzz, but I had no weight loss - in fact I gained a couple pounds. I did exercise & drink tons of water. I don't overeat in calories. And one day I coupled it with a thyroid enhancer that is suppose to be safe with other diet supplements & I should have gone to the emergency room with all the negative symptoms I had. I'm glad this works for some people, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
