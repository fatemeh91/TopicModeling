review/text: The Aquafresh Advanced Whitening Toothpaste is supposed to safely whiten teeth without bleaches. I can't say that I noticed a huge difference in my teeth, but they do seem whiter. It is probable, however, that I'll notice a bigger improvement after using the paste for a longer period of time, perhaps after using the tube for a month or so. The taste of the paste is very much like the regular Aquafresh. Aquafresh toothpaste leaves a very fresh feeling in your mouth. At this point, not having tried the whole tube yet, I would say that the paste is good. Although at $3.50 to $4.50 a tube, I've seen comparable results with Close Up Toothpaste for under $2.00 a tube.
