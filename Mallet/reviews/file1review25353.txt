review/text: I have been using this weighing scale + body fat monitor for almost a month now and absolutely love this product. It is very consistent in both weighing and body fat measurements. I tried a few weighing scales before which gave me a different weight reading every time I stepped on them. This one gave me very consistent weight readings and the body fat readings fluctuated by not more than a 1%, as described in the product literature. I highly recommend this product to anyone!Did I mention that I bought this precise instrument just for $19.99 on Amazon's Friday sale!?
