review/text: I started using Miracle Greens in June of 2005. I was tired, frequently experienced URI's, including sinus infections, and had no stamina. Now it is nearly December. I have lost 10#, without really trying to (but then I have a lot to lose), have had no sinus infections, colds, or flu. I use Miracle Greens as my breakfast 5 days a week. I mix MG with milk, juice and frozen fruit for a "smoothie". I am surprised at how well it satisfies me. I also relax a bit realizing that if my eating doesn't go well the rest of the day, I have at least started with a good dose of "vegetables & fruits." I am very pleased with the product and don't tend to be one who "sticks with" supplements. This is one, however, on which I am SOLD!
