review/text: I've been searching for a good after-shave skin product that would moisturize my face after using an electric razor because my skin gets very dry and itchy, especially in the winter months. I've tried different brands of after-shave and skin lotions, but this seems to be the best. My face has never looked healtier! I only wish the price were a little lower ($5.99 in store) and had a &quot;manly&quot; scent (this has really no scent, which is not bad, but...). I highly recommend it.
