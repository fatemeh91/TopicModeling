review/text: No, this product won't take the place of a skilled massage therapist, but for someone with chronic muscle tension and pain, it will provide significant relief. It does help if you alternate between the two power settings -- ten minutes high, ten minutes low, ten minutes high -- or something like that, so that the muscles experience a change of stimulus.My only dislike is that I can't have the heat without the massagers running. My biggest like is that it does the entire body, not just shoulders or shoulders and back.
