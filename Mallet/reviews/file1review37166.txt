review/text: My hand pain started almost two decades ago, the result of an industrial fire. My first pair of compression gloves were ugly and made of an elastic material that wore out pretty quickly. The pain was minimal enough that I just didn't bother replacing them.Recently, the pain began increasing to a level I couldn't ignore. After spending some time researching the possibilities, and hesitating over the thought of wearing gloves again, I decided on the Thermoskin gloves. I wish I had gotten them sooner.The gloves seem durable, made of what looks & feels like the neoprene in my knee braces, but much thinner & more flexible. The seams are on the outside, so the inside is soft & smooth. They add just a little warmth, are easy to work in, only take a reasonable amount of effort for me to get on & off, and have reduced the amount of swelling & pain in my fingers & hands. I wish they were a little longer; the material stops a little short of the last knuckle of each finger.I was surprised when the measuring chart put me into a medium, but they fit right. Make sure to use the chart & measuring guide on the Swede-O website. They also have a video that shows how to measure your hand for a proper fit.All in all, I would recommend these gloves to anyone with issues related to hand pain. I fact, I already have, but he is still more concerned over the way they look than the benefit they might bring.
