review/text: I agree with Reviewer from Stamford CT in advising Schick to stop exploring other designs, and support their best product: Personal Touch razor for women. Cartridges are harder than ever to find in &quot;normal&quot; drugstores: Has Schick discontinued production? Foolish! Are drugstores ordering inferior products in ice-cream colors designed to lure indiscriminate new razor users? Silly! I've had both my PT razors for many years and keep finding new sources for blade cartridges. But Amazon's prices are the best I've found so far, so as long as Shick makes 'em and Amazon stocks 'em, I'll be back to buy 'em!
