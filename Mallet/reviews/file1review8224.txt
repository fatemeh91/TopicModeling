review/text: The bottom bristles while a little stiffer than the side ones, but still overall pretty soft. I would say this is fine for gentle cleaning like it is described, but I do not get where they get vigorous cleaning from with such soft bristles. The handle length seems adequate, and the actual handle is indeed comfortable to grip and has a non-slip surfaceIt will do for light jobs and has its place, but the softness of the bristles limits what I would call vigorous scrubbing.
