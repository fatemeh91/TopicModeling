review/text: After trying many Method products, I've come to realize that some are so-so while others are fantastic. The Method Window Wash Glass and Surface Cleaner falls under the 'fantastic' category. I truly love this product. It smells great and I haven't had any more problems with streaking than Windex. I usually use crumpled newspaper to clean my windows and mirrors, and they are streak free 99% of the time. I have slowly been switching all of my household cleaners over to more natural and less harmful products so I am very happy that I found this window cleaner.
