review/text: As a public service to all you guys using electric shavers - I've had many, and this was by far the worst. I bought the shaver new about 2 months ago and it is now dead. Here's my experience:1. Although the shave is comfortable and never pulled hair out, it plain missed whiskers sticking straight out. Even multiple passes to the same area...uncanny that it would not cut some whiskers or take 10 passes to cut some. The hairs it would miss were plentiful. Requiring much more time to get a good shave.2. After the cutting head lid was openned to clean it out, and then closed, 80% of the time the shaver would not power on. It turned out that the cause of this was the 3 motorized stubs which engage with the cutting blades to spin them, were somehow binding up, so if you manually moved them the shaver would start up. This process went on 80% of the times I went to use it. Finally, the shaver would not start up at all no matter what I did.3. The trimmer is terribly designed, small, and would be more at home on a toy shaver.A huge dissappointment.
