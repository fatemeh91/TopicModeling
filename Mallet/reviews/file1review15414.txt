review/text: I bought this oil and started using it to help grow my hair. I am from India and I know what "real" hair oil should be. This is a watered down "American" version of a traditional Indian hair oil. The oil should be "made in India" to use the correct base oil and herbs. I called the company up and after the representative sound nervous by me asking questions, she told me the oil is made in the USA !! What a joke! If I want something Indian, I want it made in India! Is that asking a lot? I don't want a Toyota car that is "made in America". Anyways, sorry for the ranting but the oil doesn't work and is a real "fake". Sorry Banyan. I have read good reviews on Vadik Herbs and other brands so I'll check them out and let you all know...
