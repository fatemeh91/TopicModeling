review/text: I had irregular periods after taking birth control for years. I was trying to get pregnant but was not having any luck because I couldn't tell when I was ovulating. I asked my doctor if she thought FertilAid was safe and/or effective and she said it couldn't hurt. I was pregnant after only 1 month of taking it! I don't know if it was because of the pills or if it was just the right time but I ovulated on time after taking the pills. If you have irregular periods this is worth a try.
