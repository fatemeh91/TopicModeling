review/text: I've only owned about 3 different, but I like this one the best so far. The best feature is the length adjustment. It is so nice to not have to keep track of a bunch of attachments, it really cuts down on the junk around the house. I haven't had any problems with power, though you do have to make sure to have a full charge before starting. Plan 8 hours ahead. I wish they made an all metal, corded model with this kind of length adjustment.
