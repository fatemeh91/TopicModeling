review/text: I bought this because a friend recommended it and from searching the web, it seemed like dentists recommend this toothbrush more than the sonicare ones. But after using it for a month or so, I feel like the sonicare was better for my teeth. This brush is pretty rough on your teeth--it feels like it's grinding them down when I use it, even though I'm not really even pressing the brush to my teeth.
