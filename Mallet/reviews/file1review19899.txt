review/text: This item is very simple to install and the white plastic makes it very easy to clean. My son (22 months) has no problem sitting on it. The shield for boys is not high enough to sit him close to the front but if I move him to the rear of the seat the stream doesn't go over the shield. Great design, if it wasn't so pricey I would get rid of my portable potties and purchase 2 more of these.
