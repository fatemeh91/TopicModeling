review/text: Any man wanting to wear a beard or mustache should consider buying one of these. I started wearing a goatee about a year ago and decided then to buy it. It's been the perfect tool for maintaing a well groomed appearance on a day to day basis and it has performed without a glitch. The adjustable depth blade guard provides for easy control, and consistency, of the length at which the beard is cut. It's also great for keeping eyebrows trimmed if your inclined to do so. Remove the guard and one can easily use the trimmer to carefully shape the limits of facial hair or otherwise get rid of unwanted/unsightly hairs. After nearly a year of service I expect to be using this trimmer for many more.
