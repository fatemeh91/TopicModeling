review/text: I am still awaiting any immense benefits, but the only way I can drink this is in orange juice while holding my nose. It's been just over a week, so I'll be happy to give further updates and let you know if I get use to the awful taste. Rating is based on taste alone. After my first try, it sat for two weeks before I was brave enough to try again. Hopeful :)
