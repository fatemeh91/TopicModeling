review/text: I have used N.O. Explode, 1MR, C3, Red Bull, Spike, Endorush and so on and so on for over 8 years. I go to the gym 5+ days a week religiously and lift heavy and hard. I have always loved drinking this stuff before a workout to get me jacked up (oh, I played with Jakd 3D too) because that mixed with some carbs and great music makes for a good workout every time. Lately though, I have been starting to take a good look at the things I put into my body. Anyone reading this.....look at one of the labels of your pre-workout drink. You can probably identify only a handful of the components that make up what you drink. What the hell is the rest of that stuff that you not only can't pronounce but, really, what are all those chemicals for? I don't know, either. But I do know that one of the main ingredients is Beta Alanine. This one of the main components that gives you that hyped up feeling and can make you feel like you skin is itching underneath. This is one of the main things that puts your workouts in overdrive and it is all natural! I mix 2 tsp of this with 2 tsp Arginine, 2 tsp Creatine Monohydrate, 400 mg Caffeine and a scoop of Gatorade powder. Buying all of this will last about 6 months and contains NONE of those funky ass chemicals that (for me) is questionable. NOW supplements have also been around for quite some time and I will pick a tried and true company every time. I highly recommend this product and please try my recipe! I am also posting this review on the NOW Arginine purchase I made. By the way.......I saved about $40.00 a month by switching to this blend instead of the others.
