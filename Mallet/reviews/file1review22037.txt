review/text: I was one of those poor souls who was addicted to the medicated lip balms because of severely dry and chapped lips. I decided it was time to wean myself off of the medicated addicting stuff, and I finally hit the jack pot when I found Palmer's lip butter in chocolate peppermint. The peppermint added the little bit of coolness that I need to feel like it's medicated, but not really medicated, you know? My husband and son love the scent of it! When I put it on in the car my 3 year old will always say "mmmm, I smell chocolate, mama!"I love this product so much, that although I'm not able to find it in any of the drugstores around here anymore, that I'm about to order some from the internet!
