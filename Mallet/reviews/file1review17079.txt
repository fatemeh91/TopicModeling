review/text: After owning several Wahl trimmers, I wanted something more reliable but didn't want to break the bank. This product is perfect and was on sale for $14.77. This product feels well built, the charge lasts for and weeks, and has nice adjustable guard for various lengths and for trimming sensitive areas that is also removable for precise beard and mustache trimming.My only reason for 4 star is the misleading "Made in PRC" label which I do not believe is a TLA (Three Letter Acronym) for "Puerto Rico Commonwealth" but more likely "People's Republic of China." Really Remington, are you really that concerned to have a "Made in China" sticker on your product when I believe all Apple products and just about every other high tech device I own was probably made there? 5 star product well built in China minus 1 star for trying to hide it.
