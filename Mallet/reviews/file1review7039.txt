review/text: I used a Wahl electric razor for many years, literally until it wore out. Then I purchased a Norelco as friends had recommended it. I used it about a month, returned it and got my money back. Next came a foil Remington. Same story. Neither razor would shave close. I then ordered a Wahl Shave System 4000. It's just like old times, a close, comfortable shave every time. And it cost less than the Norelco and Remington,
