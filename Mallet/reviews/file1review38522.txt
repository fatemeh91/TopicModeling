review/text: I too was offered this curler as a Goldbox item. My eyelashes are extremely hard to curl...got that way as I got older. Most mascaras take the curl right out after using a crimping style curler.I tried using this curler as directed, didn't really work to well for me. Then I tried it AFTER the crimping. SUCCESS. The heat really helps to hold the curl in. I finally look like I have eyelashes again. The curl lasts for hours. The person that wrote about the red BARS turning white wasn't looking at the right thing. The very tip starts out red & turns white...within seconds.Would recommend this product & I don't do that often, but try it more than one way to see how it works for you (see next review about mascara first, not my method though)
