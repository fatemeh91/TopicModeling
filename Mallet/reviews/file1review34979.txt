review/text: I found this product in a health food store and decided to try it on the owners recommendation. I'm so glad that I did!!! My stomach feels so much better..no more pain! Love the German Chocolate flavor...tastes just as good as G. C. cake!!! I try to make sure to follow the directions...1 tablet 20 minutes before a meal x 3 meals, but sometimes on the weekends I forget to take them with me if I leave the house. No problem! Found that I can take one up to an hour after I eat and it still works great!! Unfortunatly I paid over $15 for a bottle at the store, but now after finding them here, I can now get two bottles for the price of one!!
