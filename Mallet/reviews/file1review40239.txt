review/text: My husband and I really liked this toothpaste. It tastes much better than other whitening toothpastes that we've tried. It also left our mouths feeling fresh and clean much longer than our old toothpaste did. I don't know if it did much to whiten our teeth, and if it did, the difference was only subtle. Overall, I think we like it enough to switch from the toothpaste we've been using for the past five years.
