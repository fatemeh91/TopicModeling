review/text: Wish I had bought this sooner! It was not available at my local retailer, so I bought a "character" seat that was available. The "character" seat slides around on the toilet seat and is not safe and does not feel secure for my daughter. The Baby Bjorn attaches easily and securely, and also removes easily from my elongated (vs. round) toilet. Although the Bjorn costs more than my initial one, it is well worth it.
