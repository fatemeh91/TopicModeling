review/text: I've tried a half a dozen "all natural" or "organic" type deoderants with very, very limited success. The best before I tried this one was from Burt's Bees with Sage oil. I live in south Louisiana and if I don't want to offend myself or anyone else around me in the summer months in the past I usually just gave in and used standard deoderant/anti-perspirants. The Weleda Wild Rose Deoderant WORKS. It smells nice going on and does a great job keeping me smelling nice - no matter what the weather or what I had for dinner the night before.
