review/text: I recently purchased this lighter and the quality is awesome!..It has a nice hefty feel..not flimsy at all. Emblem on front is raised and adds more dimension to the standard zippo..love that about this lighter. stays lit even in windy conditions.Use often and have only put lighter fluid in once so far..Highly recommend this lighter.
