review/text: Was received when promised and in a timely manner and worked great for awhile but after five or ten uses it has started coming apart when it is placed in the off position. At first you could turn it from on to off and it would stay together but now that has changed and it comes apart. When it is on and working it works great and gets the job done. It is just irritating to have to assemble it before each use.
