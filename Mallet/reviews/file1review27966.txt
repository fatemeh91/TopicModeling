review/text: Obviously if you're looking to get some lean muscle mass on ya' you're trying to get some good quality protein. From my experience Optimum Nutrition has always provided products that work very well and are reliable. I take a protein shake about a half hour before i work out to get the protein digested and ready for my muscles and then one immediately after working out to give them that quick shot of protein. Doing this, doing frequent cardio, and eating right and I saw visible results in about a month or two after i started taking working out seriously. Getting yourself motivated is half the battle. So if you can do that you're golden. But to see results I, in addition to any other person who knows about nutrition and fitness, would probably tell you to go with Optimum Nutrition. I use their protein, their multivitamin, and their creatine. Seeing results is what will make anyone keep going; using this has gotten me there. Great product. When in doubt go with ON.
