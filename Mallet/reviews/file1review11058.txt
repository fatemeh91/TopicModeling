review/text: I purchased the softgel capsules from a different vendor, but I wanted to pipe in and say that these things are the real deal! I've always been cursed with bad breath--even immediately after brushing my teeth and using mouthwash. Not only has this problem stopped (and almost immediately, too, within 2-3 days), but my sweat smells less and my BMs aren't even offensive (won't smell like roses, of course, but come on)...For reference, I take 2 capsules twice a day. I had no problems with cramping, etc. I think $10-15 a month is a reasonable price to pay for the boost in confidence, and I'll be ordering more before my existing supply runs out!
