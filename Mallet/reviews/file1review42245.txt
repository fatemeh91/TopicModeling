review/text: I was having difficulty swallowing and decided to get this liquid vitamin. I feel just like I did taking my vitamin pills each day, so I'm assuming it's working just as well. I do, however, dread having to take it. Not only does it look gross, it tastes terrible. As I read reviews of it tasting like blueberries, kiwi, or pineapple, I started wondering if I got a bad batch, because mine doesn't taste like any fruit I've ever eaten. I tried drinking it straight and I gagged. Then I tried mixing it into applesauce. I gagged and couldn't even finish it. Finally I tried it in orange juice and it's a little more palatable. I think in the end it may make me dislike orange juice. lol I've never had a liquid vitamin in the past so I can't compare, but as soon as I can swallow again, I'll be going back to taking a pill each day. My mouth will be much happier.
