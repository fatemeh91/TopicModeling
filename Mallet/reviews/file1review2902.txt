review/text: These have definitely been helping to balance my hormones: my premenstrual mood swings have been less severe since I started taking these (after the first month of taking these I noticed this).I do not like the smell/flavor of these (who are you people who think these smell/taste pleasant? I am envious!), but that's a small price to pay. Am on my second bottle.
