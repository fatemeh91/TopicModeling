review/text: I've been an avid fan of Secret since I started using deodorant, and only recently have found that it isn't always the most effective. I knew a guy who didn't like the scent of male deodorant and confided in me that he actually used Lady Mitchum because it was next to odorless and very powerful. I decided that if what he said was true than this was the deodorant that should be calling itself strong enough for a man. Two years later, I still faithfully use Lady Mitchum. If you've ever had one of those days where you're running around like crazy and you get to work and realize you haven't put on deodorant, this is the only deodorant I would use. I've done that before with no problems at all whereas with Secret I would just have to run to the store and grab some more. I would definitely recommend this for any lady (or man, for that matter) who wants a light scent with a powerful deodorant and anti-perspirant.
