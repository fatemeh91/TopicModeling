review/text: I just used this for the first time and I'm very happy with the results. I've tried other waxes and have even made my own but decided to try this wax because it was very reasonably priced. I liked the fact that you can cut the strips to use on your face or leave them whole for larger areas such as arms or legs. I just finished my upper lip area and forearms (I am brunette with noticeable hair on my arms) and they are baby smooth. I did have some red dots on my arms right after I pulled the strips off but just half an hour later they are almost gone. That happens to me anyway no matter what type of wax I use because the skin is delicate and you really are ripping each hair out at the root. But that is the price to pay if you want long lasting smoothness. I found this at a "big box store" and I'm hoping it isn't discontinued because I would buy it again. I have allergies and couldn't smell the scent of it but I don't really care what it smells like since I use it just before showering anyway. Wish I could find more of the strips to buy as replacements for when I run out.
