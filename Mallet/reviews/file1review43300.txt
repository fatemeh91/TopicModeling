review/text: I love that this spray is a more natural product than Windex, and I LOVE the way it smells, but that is all. The product leaves lots of streaks no matter how many times I go over it, and simply does not clean glass or mirrors very well at all. I really don't understand the glowing reviews. Will continue looking for a better product.
