review/text: So i was starting to get sick one day a few months ago and a bartender at my job recommended these to me. I didn't really believe him at the time and just did the usual "drink a lot of water and take vitamin C" deal.2 nights ago, i couldn't sleep a wink and was rolling around in bed with the sweats all night, then yesterday, as the day went on, i started getting the chills really bad, along with a terrible headache and full body ache. I had to call out of work, it was so bad.So i remembered my co-worker's advice and went and got some of these Wellness Pills and took 2 (i'm cheap and figured taking 2 instead of the recommended 3 would still work). I took a total of 6 pills yesterday over the course of 7 hours before i went to bed. I slept really well, minus waking up at 5 in the morning completely drenched in sweat (i'm assuming it was my body rejecting whatever i had and that the pills were actually working). I woke up at 9 this morning and i feel completely better.Honestly, as sick as i was last night, i really thought i was gonna be out of commission for at least 3 days. Wellness Pills have made a believer out of someone who's already extremely skeptical. The price isn't too bad considering how fast you can get over a sickness. I'm gonna keep this bottle handy for whenever i'm feeling something coming on, or just take one with my daily multivitamin to ensure i'm always at 100%.
