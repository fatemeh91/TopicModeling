review/text: I originally bought this brush to clean out baby bottles. It has since proven to have many uses. The long handle gets into pretty much any container including those hard to clean drink containers. It is sturdy and the brush is abrasive enough to get things clean. I found that some of the brushes have metal handles that will rust and break after several months of use. I have had this one for quite a while and it is still in perfect shape. Would highly recommend.
