review/text: I had pretty bad acne as a teenager and the doctor told me to wash my face with Lava soap and use Amantle aka acid mantle as a moisturizer. I have been using only these two products on my face since I was 16 and I am now almost 53. I don't have any wrinkles and people comment on how nice my skin is. Takes me about a yr to use up a jar of this.
