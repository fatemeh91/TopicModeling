review/text: When I got my Walk Fit inserts, I tried the medium pads because I thought I had a high arch. I ended up with the low pads because they felt the best. They are very comfortable, but I have low back trouble and thought it would help ease my back pain. They haven't, but they do make walking easier on my feet and legs. I do recommend them if you stand or walk a lot. I don't take my shoes off until I go to bed at night.
