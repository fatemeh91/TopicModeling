review/text: We started off with a plastic tub for our son until he was about 1 month and a half old. This tub fit in the kitchen sink, had a foam base and was angled like a car seat. He cried about 80% of the times we gave him a bath.A friend recommended this inflatable tub, so we bought it and he absolutely loves it. He's completely relaxed from the time he gets into the water, and usually for a while even after he gets out.We fill the tub half full, so we have to be careful and support his head while his body floats, but it's pretty easy because he's so relaxed. One hand supports his head and neck while the other hand washes him. It's actually easier to wash his back this way since we don't have to flip him around, like we did with the previous tub.Some people might prefer the tubs that fit in the kitchen sink, since you can wash the baby while standing and don't have to squat.But for us, a calm and relaxed baby versus a crying and thrashing baby made all the difference in the world.
