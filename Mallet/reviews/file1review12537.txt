review/text: I took this about a year ago, and I almost ended up in the emergency room. I was stuck in the bathroom at work for at least 15 mintues, with cramps that were so severe, I couldn't even STAND UP and pull up my pants.I went directly to my doctor's office when the cramps subsided- afraid I had done permanent damage by being stupid enough to take these pills. (and I took the recommended dosage). Luckily, the cramps didn't come back and I threw away the remaining pills.
