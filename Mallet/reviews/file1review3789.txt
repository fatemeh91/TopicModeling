review/text: Of course its easy enough to ignore the plethora of research saying this stuff is beyond bad for your liver but what really takes the cake is the fact that many people [not including myself] think it tastes downright awful. Me and my friends drank this tea and while the first one or two cups were tasty, I found one of my friends complaining of how disgusting it was while the other one threw up several times. While my experience was marginally good, I can't say i would endorse this product.
