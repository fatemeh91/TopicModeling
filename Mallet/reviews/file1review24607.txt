review/text: I don't usually write reviews but I think it's unfair that this product has such a low rating... I LOVE this stuff! Yes, I had to give up coffee in the morning - but it's worth it!I started off with just taking 1 pill at a time about 3 times a day before meals because I did a lot of research and some people had up with reactions because they're allergic to Niacin and didn't know it (red hot flushing face, etc.) - I only felt myself ever just get a little flush if I didn't eat until like an hour after taking them.After about a week I bumped it up to 2 at a time (as directed). The major things I see with this (that I love about it) is; not only does it make me feel fuller faster but it also has this crazy way of making me not even INTERESTED in food (I'm a big time late night snacker) - I have had absolutely NO CRAVINGS for any snacks at all and just the thought of them makes my stomach churn! (Unfortunately, this product was no match against my PMS symptoms &lt;&lt;GIMME CHOCOLATE NOW!>> but that's not a deal breaker over 1 week a month!)Like some other reviewers have said, I usually don't take it as directed. I've found 2 in the morning and 2 before dinner is a perfect median for me. Oh, and whatever you do DO NOT take this pill after 6pm if you like to go to sleep at 10pm (like me) - I learned my lesson on this after the first night.I thoroughly enjoy the boost of energy you get from the pills (2 pills = as much caffeine as 2 cups of coffee, which is probably a big factor on why a lot of these people have issues with it) - I also enjoy that I haven't experienced any type of "crash" from it when they wear off. Now if I could just convince myself to start working out, I know the results are going to be even more gratifying. :)
