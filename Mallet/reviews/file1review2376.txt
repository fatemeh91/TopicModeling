review/text: I've always had dry eyes problem in the past. It's especially unbearable by the end of the day at work and right after I wake up in the morning. So I keep eye drops at the office and humidifier by the bed. But the problem's been getting worse recently. So I searched online and found this.After taking it for maybe five days I began to feel an improvement. Now I just finished my first bottle, and I can't recall any serious eye irritations in the past two weeks. So I'll continue to buy this every month, until I find a cheaper solution.
