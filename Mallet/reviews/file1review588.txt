review/text: I have been taking prescribed statins for years and developed muscle pains in my legs that many neurologists cannot diagnose. Finally, an alternative medicine doctor said it could be &#34;statin-induced neuropathy&#34;, so I stopped taking the prescribed statins.My cholesterol levels went up without the medications. I searched for alternatives to lower my cholesterol and came across the book &#34;Statin Drugs and their Natural Alternatives&#34; by Jay Cohen, M.D. One of the things mentioned was Cholestin(Red Yeast Rice). The first red yeast rice I tried was Choleast by Thorne Research and after 3 months decreased my cholesterol some but not to acceptable levels. Then, I switched to Cholestene by High Performance Formulas. To my and my Doctor's surprise after only 2 months of taking 2 capsules daily, my total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels are down to acceptable levels. Even my Doctor asked what I've been taking. Part of the message I wish to convey is that NOT all Red Yeast Rice formulas have the same effectiveness...so be aware of this.
