review/text: My husband had severe gout about 20 years ago, and with the medicine they put him on he was at the doctors regularly for blood tests, and always getting more prescriptions. Then we heard about Black Chery, being good at relieving gout , so we tried it. Needless to say for about 20 years, we have not had to go to a doctor about the gout, or get a prescription. Don't know if it would work for everyone, but in my mind it would be worth the effort to try it. Remember that herbs and such take a while to work in to the system, so if you try it give it a good month or two to start working.The cost of taking this yearly is a lot less than prescriptions and doctor visits.
