review/text: I have a very strong gag reflex and this is the one and only protein shake that I can drink and enjoy. The taste is really, really good. Not chalky, not funky sweet. I mix it up in those blender/ shaker things with the wire ball. It blends SO well. A few vigorous shakes and it's totally dissolved. I mix it with rice milk and love the taste. Thank you to all the other great reviews that attracted me to buy this product.
