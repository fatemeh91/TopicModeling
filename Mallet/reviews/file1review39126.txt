review/text: Lots of safety oriented accessories that should be included only if you are having a five-year old cut your hair. I cut my own and find that the included guards are missing a length somewhere between short and shaved. I realize that this is a personal preference but I would pay the dollars for an infinitely adjustable guard in the 1mm, 5mm range. These clips are so much more powerful than the cordless model that I was using previously. A great product overall. I would buy it again...
