review/text: I bought this recently, and always had problems keeping the batteries in. I had to hold the cap on the whole time for it not to turn off. The sensor also lasted much less than 500 tests. I have had the monitor about 6 months and used it less than 100 times, and now it wonk work until I replace the sensor. It was a lot of money for poor quality, but it did seem to measure alcohol level consistently
