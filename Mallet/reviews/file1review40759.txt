review/text: This medication planner is the best I've used! My husband has a brain injury and forgets to take his meds all the time, even with an alarm set on his cell phone. Now the alarm goes off on the planner and he has to go to it in order to turn it off. Its loud enough for people with normal hearing, and the sound carries well in our 1200 square foot home. It's also portable for times when we're out of the house. It's just perfect for us! No more missed meds!
