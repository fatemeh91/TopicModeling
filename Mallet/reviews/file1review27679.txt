review/text: Not much to say other than it actually taste like chocolate, unlike their vanilla and strawberry (yuck!). I've been buying this brand and flavor for a couple of years now and have no intention of switching. The price is the lowest I've found to date so I'll be buying again from this vendor when I need more.
