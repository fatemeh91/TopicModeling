review/text: I had to buy a new BP Monitor. After finding out this machine was rated #1 in the U.S. I bought it & wasn't sorry. It is easy to use & has a memory function to compare previous readings. The on screen display is nice. The Monitor is more than a BP & Pulse reader. This Omron Monitor is well worth the price. It comes with a nice carrying case too.
