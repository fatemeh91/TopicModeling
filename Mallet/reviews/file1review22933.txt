review/text: I bought that sweeper a month ago, and I can say that it was a very bad purchase. I have a wood floor and the sweeper makes a lot of noise, it is impossible to clean in the edges or corners and its head doesn't turn. I do not recomend ti buy this product, in addition the stick has three parts which separate constantly
