review/text: I started taking these capsules about a month ago. I have not had a formed bowel movement since. Nearly every time I go to void, I squirt a little from the other orifice. I was hoping to become regular and normal, but this product can't deliver that. At least not for me. I'm still taking it because I need it and I spent all that money for two bottles, but when they are gone, I'm looking for something else. This can't be healthy for my colon.6/8/11: Just opened the second bottle. It wasn't damaged and the seal was intact, but when I pulled back the seal, powder blew out all over the place. I poured all the capsules out to inspect the contents and there were 6 caps that were completely obliterated and the powder was all out of them. WHAT A MESS. There is no way I won't be handling that powder every time I pour a couple out into my hand for as long as this bottle still has caps in it. I just called the company and they told me to contact the seller on Amazon, so that's what I'm about to do. If they replace the damaged bottle with a new one, I will post here.Took a while to get the right number and for them to "find me", but they are sending me a brand new bottle of caps. All's well that ends well. They stand by their products.
