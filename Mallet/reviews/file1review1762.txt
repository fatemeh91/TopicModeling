review/text: I read all of the previous reviews and thought I'd give this product a try. I have had cracked heels for years that my husband has repeatedly told me was due to foot fungus. I've tried athlete's foot sprays and creams which work for a while but then stop. After only a few days of cleaning my feet with this product my heels are almost completely smooth! I've never had that fast of a response using sprays and creams. Plus, I've been using it as a body-wash and have noticed a decrease in body odor after I exercise. I love this stuff!
