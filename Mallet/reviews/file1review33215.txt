review/text: i bought these because of the enormous endorsement by my super health conscious (vegan) friend. when i got them i couldnt believe the funk! i have taken them and did not notice if they helped or not. i take them occasionally when not feeling well (but only at night). they give you the WORST breath and you can taste them for a while after swallowing. the after taste actually prevents me from taking them on a daily basis. too bad, because i would like to see what all the hype is about. smell is AWFUL.
