review/text: I am responsible for the operation of an eco tour dolphin watch boat, HOKU NAI'A, off the Waianae Coast of Oahu in Hawaii. My trip manager will not leave the pier without MotionEaze. He uses it to help passengers who feel a bit queezy once we are out at sea looking for the dolphins. Its' the only product that we have ever found, in thirty years of doing this, that works after people already feel queezy. Most other products are just one more foreign object in their tummy by that time, but this one is applied externally and so doesn't have that problem, and it is effective for about 90% of the people we apply it to. Please do keep this product available for us.Thanks.
