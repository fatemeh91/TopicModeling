review/text: I think the chair is a good value for the money, but when the battery charger was missing from the box, I called Comfort Products at 1-800-971-4630 (from the instructions) to get the charger sent to me. It is nearly impossible to speak to someone -- they want you just to leave your name and number and they will call you back (NOT!!!). During the last month, I've made four phone calls on four different dates and have spoken to two people -- a customer service rep for retailers and the credit manager. Guess what -- no response, no call-back, no charger.If you open the box and find there's no charger, TAKE IT BACK! You won't ever know if the massager works or not because you won't be able to get the charger.
