review/text: First, they are protien bars not snickers or 3 musketeers or anything of the sort. I work out five times a week and eat healthy everyday, these bars are my treats, they have most of the protien I need in one meal and they taste fabulous IF you compare it to a non fat low carb alfafa sprout and goat cheese wrap. I have tried a good majority of the protien bars out there and this is pretty much the only one I like. two thumbs up!
