review/text: This product comes in 2 parts held together with 4 screws. Unfortunately, one of the screw holes was not threaded and I had to tap it out with a 1/4-20 tap. I suppose someone got distracted on the assembly line. I don't think many people would have a tap set on hand to fix this themselves. I suppose I would have simply had to leave one screw off if I didn't cut the threads in the hole. Once I got it together, it worked fine. I prefer digital scales, but home digital scales just don't seem to last more than 6 months. This balance bar scale should last forever.
