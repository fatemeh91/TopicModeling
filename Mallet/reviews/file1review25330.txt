review/text: Years ago I received one from my dentist and have been using them ever since. My dentist doesn't give them out anymore which is a shame. I think they are great as they are durable, flexible and comfortable. Some others I have tried just don't do a good enough job such as those found on the end of a toothbrush that you can buy and others can scrape you too hard like the metal ones if you are not careful. Its great to carry with you especially after you've eaten something like garlic or cheese to help remove the remains from your tongue and so you don't continually have that taste in your mouth. Brushing just isn't the same for me unless I have my scraper to accompany it.
