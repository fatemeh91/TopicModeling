review/text: Not writing an in-depth product analysis, just posting to say I love this protein. It is decent in water, but I enjoy it the most in some light vanilla soy milk. Delicious in regular milk as well. Can't go wrong here. I do recommend a shaker for mixing, though! Pretty impossible to fully dissolve with a spoon, same with any other brand of protein powder, however, so definitely not a con.
