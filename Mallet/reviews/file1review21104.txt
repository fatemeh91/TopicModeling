review/text: This is the best type of heating pad I've ever used. The heat is intense and the moist heat really helps my neck and shoulder pain. A friend loaned me one first and after I tried it I knew I had to buy one of my own. The moist heat seems to provide longer pain relief than a regular heating pad.
