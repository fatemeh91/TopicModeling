review/text: I bought this model a year ago and have never had it effectively cut nose hair. It's as if there are no blades! It's completely ineffective and a waste of money. I've tried it continually over the past year and repeatedly end up going back to my old Panasonic model, which works much better. At long last, the Wahl goes in the trash.
