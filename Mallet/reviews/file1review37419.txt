review/text: This product is great! I prefer it over shaving or waxing. No fuss or muss.With this tool, all I need is this tool and spray a bit anti-baterial spray afterwards.The only things I didn't anticipate was that I neededed to glide this tool slowly and many times through the same area. You can feel slight plucking sensation, but since my hair is quite fine, the pain was not that bad and a lot less compared to waxing. Also, since I don't need to do this routine so much now, I have to re-read the instruction manual every time I use it. I'm using it once 2~3 weeks now. I love it, and will definitely buy another one if this one breaks.
