review/text: I drink this for breakfast every morning. I mix it with 8th Continent Complete light vanilla soy milk. It has less calories thsn skim milk, and is loaded with vitamins and minerals. I'm not a fan of soy milk, but mixed together this it's like a milkshake. I enjoy the flavor so much that I'm bummed when I've finished it. It keeps me full for about 3 1/2 hours. When I'm hungry again I eat a handful of raw almonds and I'm good until lunch. Slim Fast has come a long way.
