review/text: Although I received the batteries quickly, they were the wrong ones, namely, no-Max versus Max, which I ordered (and paid). Luckily, the seller offered me a discount of 25%, which I hope will cover for me getting the inferior batteries. However, I got too much involved with this purchase, trying to get the tracking for the shipment, as well as trying to recover from the seller sending me the wrong batteries, which left me with quite sour taste in my mouth. Luckily, I will not need to purchase another pack of batteries for more than one month, until which I hope that I will find a better provider. Otherwise, the batteries have been marked as "USE BY 2015", which shall suffice me, provided that I received them on 1/4/2013. I can only hope that the promised life will be true.
