review/text: I switched to this product because of good reviews, i was hoping it would be the answer to my dreams, namely a Gel which feels good on the skin, smells good and works great when shaving, unfortunately i have found this product less than ideal for my sensitive skin type, it makes my skin itch after using it, it also does not give the close shave i was hoping for, therefore i would advise people to check carefully before they buy, if their skin is sensitive they might wish to consider another product.
