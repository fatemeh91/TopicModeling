review/text: I was skeptical because I had recently quit Ambien cold turkey due to side effects and dependency, and was again experiencing a lot of trouble falling and staying asleep. I had been taking benydryl to put me to sleep but that was starting not to work either. I picked a small pack of this up at the health food store to give a shot, since it was pretty cheap for 12 gels. Low and behold it worked! It relaxes me similar to ambien, but not as immediate and dramatic. Hopefully it will continue to work for me. My insomnia is more of an inability to turn my thoughts off, like I will lay awake replaying conversations I had at work all day long.
