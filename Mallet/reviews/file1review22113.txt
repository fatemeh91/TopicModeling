review/text: Tom's of Maine is known for only incorporating natural ingredients in it's toothpaste. This particular brand of toothpaste carries the certification of the American Dental Association (thus it has fluoride and is not too abrasive). Best of all it is sweetened with xylitol, a natural sugar from birch trees which has been proven to kill bacteria instead of feeding them. Xylitol is the best addition to a toothpaste product in years, and dentists recognize that it definitiely improves oral health. This toothpaste uses calcium carbonate as the abrasive; this being a much milder abrasive as compared to silica (finely ground sand).This brand does not have any tartar inhibitors or desensitizers added to it. If you need tartar-control, then I would recommend the following:Tom's of Maine Natural Whole Care Anticavity & Tartar Control Plus Whitening Gel Toothpaste, Cinnamon-Clove, 0.91 oz (25.8 g), Case of 12 Tu, or for sensitive teeth: Toms of Maine Sensitive Care SLS-Free Antiplaque Toothpaste for Sensitive Teeth, Black Currant - 4 OzWhat I really like about Toms' of Maine is the label. It explains what is in each tube! No other toothpaste does this and Tom's of Maine is to be highly commended for liting each ingredient and why it is there.The only drawback to this toothpaste is its price. It will cost slightly more than other toothpastes, but knowing what you are getting inside the tube is worth the extra price to this mouth.Dr. Jim Koenig, DDS
