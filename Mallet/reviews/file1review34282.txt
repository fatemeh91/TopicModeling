review/text: This is one of those products that you wish you had years ago. I also have been ordering the product provided by ABBREVA exclusively since they are very professional and seem to have consistent access to this hard to find (trustworthy source quality). My next order will be my third. I'm stocking-up since everything that helps seems to be difficult to come by. No comparison to any other competitor. It's just that good! Also, buy some finger cots to apply more effectively so you don't have unsanitary or weird smelling hands.
