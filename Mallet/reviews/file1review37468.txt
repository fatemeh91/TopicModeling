review/text: This stuff tastes like nothing I've ever tasted before -- it's sickly sweet but not in a pleasant way -- not tart like Dex4 tabs or refreshing like some liquids. It also doesn't work as fast but very nearly.That said it's a must for diabetic SCUBA divers who might experience hypoglycemia while diving -- it takes a little practice but you can use it underwater so you don't have to surface if you start feeling the hypoglycemic slump coming on. A tube of this and a little moderation of activity and you can avoid a full-on blood sugar crash. No muss, no fuss, no emergency in the water.NOT recommended for people who can't feel the drop or are not aware when they are hypoglycemic. Divers' Alert Network has more info on DWD (Diving While Diabetic).
