review/text: this monitor is great, all the complaints about it not working correctly are going to be user error or someone that has abnormal anatomy. there are picture directions right on the cuff so i don't really understand how people are getting confused where to place the cuff.only complaint is that every singe time i use it it claims i have an irregular heart beat but i was at the doctor a week before i bought this and the nurse and doc both took my BP more than once each and didnt notice anything. i think the monitor just thinks Sinus arrhythmia is automatically irregular HB.
