review/text: Hubby and I have been trying for 1 year. My AF comes after 46 to 52 days. And last for 8 days. I started taking FA July 20th. So far I feel twinges in my ovaries. My hormones and moods are not "all over the place". I can feel the difference. I have not ovulated yet, however im going to in the next few days.
