review/text: This eye gel helps me sleep through the night and so far, the others only give me an hour of relief or so. Dry eye syndrom is so painful, and life altering that if you are frustrated and exhaused from lack of sleep because you're waking with eye lids stuck to your eye balls...you must try this gel! Be sure to take omega 3, get plenty of fluids, and talk to your doctor about tear duct plugs. You'll be better in no time :-)
