review/text: Superlative product. Closest shaves I've had in years of using those silly multi-blade monstrosities from the "big names" in men's grooming. Effortless in use. I get typically six to seven shaves from a blade, versus two or three from the others. More important, each shave is as close as the one before it. I probably change blades more often than I need to -- that's the level of quality of this product from Merkur. Highly recommended! Oh, and get a Merkur razor (handle) for a perfect combination.
