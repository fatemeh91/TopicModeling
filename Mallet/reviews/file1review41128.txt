review/text: Well .. I'm a female and this is my second day trying out this product. I have a problem of ingrown hairs. I have been seeing a little progress in some parts of my body, but at some parts I guess my skin is a little more tough so it might take longer to get to see results. The only problem in this product is that it didn't mention when I bought it that it was a travel size. I only found out that it was when I received it and it said on the receipt that it was a Travel size. I'm not good at relating sizes (oz) to actual size. So just in case you are like me. This is a tiny little travel container.
