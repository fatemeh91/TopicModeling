review/text: Our son has a metabolic disorder that is helped by taking biotin. These capsules were very small compared to other brands of 5 mg biotin capsules we'd purchased. After a few weeks on these, my son became symptomatic again. We switched him to GNC brand 5 mg capsules and he stabilized. It is my opinion that these capsules did not contain a full 5 mg of biotin or that they did not contain biotin at all. The FDA really doesn't regulate vitamins well, so those of you taking them for medical reasons should find a reliable manufacturer. Country Life is not reliable. I wanted to give this product zero stars, but the application would not let me do that--so consider my rating zero stars.
