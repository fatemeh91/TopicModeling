review/text: I got this as a present from my husband. My life has become so much more convinient with this epilator. Of course, like all others who think so, epilators are suited only to those who are accustomed to plucking of hair from roots.The specialised detachable shaving heads work very well n are very easy to clean. I have now been using this for about an year n its perfect.
