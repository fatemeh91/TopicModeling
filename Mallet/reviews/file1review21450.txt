review/text: My hygienist always comments on how good my teeth and gums look. She can always tell which of her patients use a sonic toothbrush vs a manual toothbrush. Definitely recommend.Do be cautious when buying replacement heads. Make sure the replacement head matches the original. There are lots of varieties, and easy to confuse.
