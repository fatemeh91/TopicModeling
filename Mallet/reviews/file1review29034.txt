review/text: This shaver gives a nice clean cut, however it seems to take over twice as long as my last Braun shaver. My previous Braun has two heads while this one only has one. At the time, I didn't give it much thought, but in retrospect, I would have sought after one which had two. All in all, paying an extra $30 for one of the nicer Brauns would have been a better idea.
