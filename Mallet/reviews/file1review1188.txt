review/text: I was hunting for another product very similar to this one. Decided to give the less expensive product a try. It is very good for the money, but is not as soft as my original choice. These certainly can and should be a part of complete oral care program. The dispensing carry case is handy. If a person does not have access to floss, or any other between the teeth cleaning items this product is definately worth a try. I will likely buy them again.
