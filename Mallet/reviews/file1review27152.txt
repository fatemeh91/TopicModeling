review/text: I have only just started using this. I love the fact that when I get tired of vanilla, I can add chocolate powder or peanut butter. I try to eat well but life being what it is, I don't always eat what I should. I am past 50 yrs old and I am using this to make sure that my protein intake is being supplemented.
