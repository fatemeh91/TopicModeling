review/text: I am a firefighter/paramedic in a major US city, I was in need of a stethescope that was cheap and worked great. I bought this in hopes that it was just as great as a littmann cardiology, it's close. The sound quality is about 80% to a littmann, but the design and build quality are not. The diaphragms are always falling off and the bell housing seems to sometimes spin freely. Delphi did send me a new diaphragm, but it was a Littmann, works bettter now.
