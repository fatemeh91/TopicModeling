review/text: The ph level of this water is high, slightly higher than evian. It really changes and hydrates your body, we are so acidic these days and not healthy. I felt a difference in myself after an hour of drinking a few glasses. Research the ph difference, it is a blessing. They just started selling it in the US, I think it's only available at stores in the us and online, won awards in france.
