review/text: These batteries are fine for toys, remote controls, etc, but not for battery eaters like digital cameras. I guess they just don't have high capacity although they are called "high performance". I used to use these in my Canon A510, and 2 batteries would be gone in like 2 hours! It is a big hassle to keep changing batteries, especially when you are travelling. I blamed my camera at first, but when I tried a pair of 2500mah rechargables, I know the difference - The battery life is at least 2-3 times longer!
