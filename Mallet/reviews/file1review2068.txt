review/text: I have had this brace for a month now, and have been wearing it most nights. I noticed that after I wear it, my foot often hurts more but in a different way than it did before I wore the brace. I guess that is just the tendons stretching. I also noticed a little swelling one day. My feet are pretty flexible, so in order to feel like it is stretching my big toe I have to put it on pretty tight. The rigid plastic piece that goes along the bottom sometimes presses uncomfortably on the bone in the ball of my foot (the big toe joint). I realize that this could be because I have very boney feet (there is very little padding in the palms of my hands as well). This sometimes makes my foot hurt the next day, and I can only wear sneakers or foam flip flops at the moment :( I prevent this by wearing a gel bunion pad underneath the brace, but I try not to do that too much because that makes it fit even tighter and I worry about blood circulation. I hope this review is helpful; I think I really should have just gone to the doctor to begin with.On the product itself, it came very quickly and seems to be made well. Considering what it is intended to do, I think it is pretty comfortable. I have no complaints about the product itself, other than the fact that it sometimes puts too much pressure on the ball of my foot, I am just not sure it was the answer for my specific issue. It does actually make sleeping more comfortable, since when I'm not wearing it, unless I am sleeping flat on my back which I don't do much, I feel like any time my big toe touches the mattress it's being forced more out of place. This brace prevents that very nicely. I just don't feel like it's reversing the condition at all, which some reviews have claimed.
