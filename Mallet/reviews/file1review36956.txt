review/text: This item works fairly well but could be a little wider and grip the socks better. I have large feet (13 EEEE) and have some problems with the socks sliding off the plastic before they are as far as my heels. I also wish the strap was a bit longer. That would probable not be a problem for those with smaller feet. It still does what it's supposed to but sometimes I have to try it 3-4 times before I get the top of the sock up far enough to grip it with my hands and pull it up the rest of the way. It's still a good product tho'.
