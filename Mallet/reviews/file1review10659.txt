review/text: I have changed my eating habits once and for all and this includes drinking habits as well. I only eat whole foods and i only drink water and needless to say when im not hungry and when i wake up in the morning or before a workout i drink this stuff down.Unflavored and it still doesnt taste bad, There is no horrible after taste either.Whats best is its all 100% natural no artificial ingredients or flavorings like other wheys and supplements on the market. NowFoods is #1 in my book.Its been 2 weeks of constant working out my muscles are bruised and im getting cut! dropping body fat like a mad men on crack lol.This is my 2nd purchase and next time im maybe getting the 5lb because this 1lb goes to fast!Anyways its a great whey supplement with BCAA and there is no need to buy any BCAA supplement as long as your eating healthy and taking this stuff!Love it love it love it. Try it out its good!
