review/text: This has been a reliable trimmer for my beard and mustache. Eventually my toddler dropped it one too many times, and the height adjuster doesn't stay above 4. Even that would be ok for my current style, but the battery is practically dead, so every week I need to charge it all day and night just to get one use out of it.I'm seriously considering buying this model again if I don't go for thePhilips Norelco T780 Rechargeable Vacuum Trimmerinstead.
