review/text: This is an excellent choice for the average guy. I am in my late 20's, working, living a regular active lifestyle. I will not vouch for the hardcore fitness guy, because that is not me. Through the years I have bought other brands of deodorant when on sale (ie. Right Guard, Mitchum, Old Spice, Sure), and have found myself always going back to Degree (others become back-up). The other brands that I have used can be somewhat comparable. Mitchum works alright, but it has much less deodorant and is more expensive. Old Spice also is a contender, but the smell is a little strong and its cross brands are not always consistent with one another. Overall, Degree is an excellent choice for the average guy who needs a quality, non-budget breaking deodorant.Update; I tried the "Ion Technology" Degree and it was awful, stick with the regular Degree.Degree for Men Deodorant With Silver Ion Technology, Cool Impact, 3-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)Pros:-Budget priced-Bigger stick than more expensive brands (ie. Mitchum)-Not an overwhelming perfume smell-Never a problem with wetness-No white residueCon:-Sometimes cheaper at drug store
