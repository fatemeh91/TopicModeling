review/text: Let me first say that I really like this product, it is extremely comfortable and does an excellent job blocking out light, however what good is it if it falls apart in two weeks? I have purchased these masks in the past and got a very reasonable amount of use out of them(8-12 months used every night) before they fell apart. But, this time, the inner liner came off both masks within two-weeks of use. So, what to give it for stars, hmm, well 5-stars for comfort and functionality minus three stars because I couldn't enjoy the functionality for very long.
