review/text: The Brook stone foot bath is the ultimate luxury item for aching tired overworked feet. The jets that you can direct downward or upward to create a hot tub experience for your feet. I didn't discover these until I was almost done. There is an air control on the unit that controls the bubbles. One thing to note, I purchased the Masada Peppermint Tree Oil and the Tea Tree Oil with the foot bath for a 120 dollars. Please note that the manual recommends against using bath salts as they say it will clog the unit.But other than that I am very happy that I spent the extra money to buy the Brook Stone Foot Bath.Foot Baths - Heated foot bath
