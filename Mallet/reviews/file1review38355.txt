review/text: I have been using epilators for many years and I find this product to be very easy to use and fast with the new double heads. The only thing that would be an improvement would be a travel bag instead of the nice box in comes in. I also prefer the epilators with a cord because that last one I had the battery didn't last very long. If you haven't tried a epilator in many years you need to try it again. They are not that painful as before. I received my product in a timely manor. I only wish Amazon would take paypal. KRK
