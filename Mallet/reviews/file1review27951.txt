review/text: Because you have one friend that uses this product and hasn't seen results that means it doesn't work? Try using your brain before posting another review. Your friend's lack of progress is not an indication of this products ability to perform its purpose. Whey Protein is not a magic shake that is going to give you muscle. You need a good diet and equally good training in the gym in order to see results. The purpose of protein is to fuel the rebuiling of the muscle tissue you break down in the gym. Since most protein consumption takes time, and is inconvenient directly after a workout, whey protein is ideal. It mixes fast, requires no preparation, and whey is digested faster than any other type of protein.That being said, Optimum Nutrition produces the highest quality whey protein. It mixes well, and tastes great. 24g per scoop is a perfect amount as well. I take one in the morning and two postworkout...among other things.
