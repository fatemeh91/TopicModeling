review/text: This has a good taste. If you are going to mix with a spoon, it is much easier in water ... although the taste is obviously watered down. Tastes better in milk, in my opinion, but it is also tougher to get the powder to completely dissolve when mixing by spoon. Of course if you're using a blender, you will not get any lumps no matter what you mix the powder in. I typically have a scoop before lifting in the morning. For breakfast afterwards, I've found that it tastes great mixed in with oatmeal, fruit, and nuts (the chocolate coloring of the powder makes this look like gruel, so if you like your food to be aesthetically pleasing, maybe this is not a good change of pace for you).I've used this product for several years now to supplement my diet because I've always felt that it is relatively cheaper than other protein powders but without sacrificing too much in quality. I've consistently bought the chocolate flavor because it is typically the cheapest, for whatever reason. Occasionally I will buy a 1 or 2 pound bag of a different flavor just to keep my tastebuds interested.
