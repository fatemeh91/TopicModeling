review/text: This was my third purchase of this item. The mask is super soft, comfortable and roomy for you eyes, unlike many others that are uncomfortably tight and flat. You don't even feel like you are wearing a mask.Mine lasted for two years without any damage or fraying.I highly recommend this item and will not hesitate to reorder when needed. I love the convenience of being able to purchase it on Amazon because I could not find a product this good in any store.
