review/text: If you've noticed that your coffee doesn't taste like it did when the coffeemaker was new, you need Dip-it. Forget vinegar and water or trying to clean those hard-to-get-at places by hand! The reason I use Dip-it? Simple: it does a great job removing coffee oils and water scale from the coffemaker. I use it after every 30 or so brewing cycles with my Hamilton Beach BrewStation Deluxe, and it keeps my coffee tasting like it did the day the pot was new. I highly recommend this product.
