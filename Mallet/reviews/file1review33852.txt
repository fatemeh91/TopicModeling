review/text: I ordered the frosted lilac (which actually looks more pink than lilac)a few months ago right as I was coming to the end of nursing school. All throughout school I was wondering if I was going deaf because I purchased a cheesy little stethoscope from the bookstore at school (which they should not be allowed to sell!!). I couldn't hear anything when I tried to listen to lung sounds!! When I purchased this stethoscope I was amazed at the difference! I am working as a nurse now and have had only a few problems with it, but it's usually on elderly patients who don't quite understand that "I'm going to listen to your lungs" is not an invitation to start chatting! I gave it only 4 stars because while it works pretty well considering the low cost, I've noticed that I can hear a lot easier with some of my coworkers stethoscopes. I still don't think I can convince myself to buy a Littmann when this brand's prices are so much lower!
