review/text: I love this shaving gel. It's amazing how it can cushion your skin to prevent nicks and cuts. My skin felt very smooth after shaving and the shave was very close. My husband also tried this out, and loved it! He said that he'll only use Gillette Shaving Gel in the future since he got the ""best shave of his life."" We both highly recommend it. We also liked the Pacific Light fragrance.
