review/text: This came quickly is made to fit well into all Cylinder based meals carriers like the Bento meals from Zojirushi or Tiger. definitely makes regularly cleaning much simpler and faster if you pack your meal carriers a fair bit like I do. nothing defective or cheap about the brush. Good cleaning tool.
