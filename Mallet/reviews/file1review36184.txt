review/text: I bought this to help my stomach make a thicker mucous lining to help heal a stomach ulcer. This product helped my ulcer pain slightly. I think it would work better if it didn't have additional ingredients that are stomach irritants. I switched to dried licorice root and it worked tremendously better. The dried root still has the DGL so I had to monitor my blood pressure. If you have high blood pressure the DGL licorice is the way to go, but I would try a different brand than this. I'm not a doctor and I'm not offering this information as medical advice.
