review/text: After much researching, got this for my daughter for Christmas. She is a server and wanted this because her feet were hurting after her shifts. She loves it! Says it works great and the only problem is all of her friends want to come over and use it too. Very happy with my choice as I had read a lot of bad reviews for some of the other spas. This was one of the most expensive foot baths, but it seems it was well worth the money.
