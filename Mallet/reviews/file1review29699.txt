review/text: I received these pads as a gift from a friend. I was really excited as I liked the feel of the cloth better than the feel of my disposable pads. These pads work really well for me during the day when I can change them if I feel they are not keeping the wetness away. The negative is that at night I always wake up wet. In the beginning I thought maybe it was because my body wasn't used to my babies schedual and I was leaking excessivly but it has been almost 6 weeks and they just do NOT work at night!
