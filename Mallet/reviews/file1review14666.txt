review/text: I've been using this product on and off for a month. When I take it (usually with breakfast) I notice a slight but noticeable effect on my concentration levels. Obviously you have to focus on a task, i.e., stop slacking, but when you do, you tend to become less distracted. If I need to turn around some work in an expeditious manner, I'll pop a pill and focus. Generally I'll look up and notice that two hours have elapsed, with the finished product in front of me (of good quality).I've noticed zero side effects. I experienced a slight headache once, but as I said, I've been consuming this pill for over a month and only had one headache. What do you have to lose by trying it? It's cheaper and safer than taking prescription drugs, e.g., Adderall.
