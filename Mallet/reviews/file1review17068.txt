review/text: A review for a beard trimmer doesn't need to be lengthy - they're basic devices. They need to:(a) trim your beard well, and(b) not break.I have had many different beard trimmers over the years and, surprisingly, this is the only one that has performed these two functions without fail.For the money, pick up this no thrills but exceptionally functional beard trimmer. Unless you need your beard trimmer to perform five other superfluous functions, you will not be disappointed.
