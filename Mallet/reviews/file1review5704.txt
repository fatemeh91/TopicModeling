review/text: As long as they keep making this model, this is the one I'm going to get. The 9-volt battery really makes a difference, and if you use rechargeable batteries it's no big deal to switch them out every few uses. It does suck up a lot of power, but that's a GOOD thing while you're using it. VERY strong vibrations. Every toy I've tried to buy since that uses AA or AAA batteries has been disappointing; this one has me spoiled.The last one of this type I bought several years ago, and it's finally giving up from old age. I'm about to buy another.
