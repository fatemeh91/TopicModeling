review/text: I sent for these because I have liked the product for a long time. They truly pack a lot of nutrition into one of these bars. They are easy to take along while hiking or long walks on the beach, and are an adequate meal substitute. And they taste good...On hindsite though, the large quantity I had to buy will have me seeking out a variety pack next time.
