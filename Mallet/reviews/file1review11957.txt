review/text: Before I got pregnant I was using a different brand of prenatal vitamins, But then I got pregnant.... I didn't have any typical pregnancy symptoms UNTIL I tried to take a prenatal vitamin. I would promptly throw it up within 30 minutes. I tried different brands, quantities, and taking them in every possible way imaginable (ground up, with milk, in the middle of a large meal, morning, afternoon, evening, right before bed, with a large glass of milk as I laid down for bed). I easily tried 4-6 different brands of prenatal vitamins. My stomach just did not want them. That's when I stumbled on these by chance. And lo and behold, I took them without a problem. Seriously I didn't even need to take them in a "special way" just popped one without any side affects. I think once I might have taken it in the middle of my night (I'm a flight attendant so, time zones can mess with pill schedules) and my stomach was a bit upset, but didn't upchuck which is still saying something.Try these. They are easy on your digestion and even more of a plus they won't back you up either.
