review/text: I have tried the wart bandages, the liquid remover as well as the freeze off kinds(do it yourself and at the doctor's office) without any luck getting rid a couple of warts. In a desperate attempt I even took a razor blade and attempted to cut them out. I will never have to try that again. PediFix Wart Stick is amazing. I have not had any issues of redness in the area it's being applied as some of the other reviewers have stated. After using for about 2 weeks, the warts have been shrunken to roughly 1/4 of what they were. I just wish that I had tried this product sooner.
