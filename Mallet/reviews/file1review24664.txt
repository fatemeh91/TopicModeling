review/text: I'm on day 7, and I've lost 3 lbs. NO, its not a miracle pill. I've been doing this, weight watchers and turbo jam every other day. But it DOES give me the energy I need to work out! I take 2 first thing in the morning, and ONE at 2 pm. I would not take ANY after 2 pm, because I know I won't sleep then. And the one time I took 2 pills at 2 pm, I didn't fall asleep until 4 am. So....take them in moderation, along with a proper diet and exercise program, and they will give you a boost!
