review/text: For almost twenty dollars (thirty dollars list, according to Amazon ...), I thought this might be a pretty good trimmer. And the reviews seemed good, so I bought one. Well, I tried several new batteries in the trimmer, but it still nicked and cut when I tried it. Not for tender noses! ... the thing hurts and leave red inflamed marks on tender skin. I really just can't stand to use it at all ... I fear it's going to draw blood. It might be OK on ears, but I don't need it for that. It's also of flimsy construction and I'm afraid that if I once accidentally dropped the thing on bathroom floor or countertop, that would be the end of it. I much preferred my old Wahl brand trimmer, which did a good job, never hurt, has been durable and lasted years -- and Wahl costs less! The Panasonic is OUT and I'm going to buy another Wahl brand.
