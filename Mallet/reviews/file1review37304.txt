review/text: I have Wahl Homecut adjustable 305G Model MC clippers that are about fifteen years old. Ancient. But the teeth on the metal plate broke a few years back so I haven't been using it on my boys. Instead of buying a new one, I decided to try these after contacting the Wahl customer service to see if they still had a model of blade that might fit. These blades (1045-100) fit perfectly and they came very quickly and with no fuss. Thanks!
