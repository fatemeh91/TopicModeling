review/text: I ordered one of these buggers and noticed a couple of defects. 1- it was incredibly low powered and 2- there was no difference in power level from switch 4 to 5. Amazon was kind enough to send me a replacement. The new one is a bit more powerful, but I honestly think this brand is no good. I have ordered the tlc space vibe version many times and have never had an issue. Amazon, I hope you discontinue carrying this specific product. Your customers are trying to give you some good advice.
