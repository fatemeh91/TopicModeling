review/text: My son has been using the Braun 8595 for several years, which afforded him a comfortable shave, and we used the replacement foil and cutter "8000 Series" Activator during the past years, which was a perfect fit and replacement, like the original. Braun apparently discontinued this foil cutter block, and the new one caused my son great pain and discomfort during his shave! I had to go out and buy him an entire new system, and am going to try to return the unused, and hopefully the slightly used foil and cutter. The REPLACEMENT foil and cutter says: Braun 51S Series 5 / 8000 Series, 360(degrees)Complete, Activator. If you are at all sensitive, you might not like this replacement!
