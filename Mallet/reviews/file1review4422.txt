review/text: They got me. I got a sample Fusion razor and wow what a shave!I was hooked, and now I spend my time looking for refill blades on line. They are simply too expensive in a retail store - thus the 4 star rating. Online you may find them still somewhat expensive but you can buy them without selling off your portfolio.The shave is smooth as silk and franky it's worth the extra cost. It's a better shave in half the time.
