review/text: I am currently using this ankle brace post-ankle reconstructive surgery. I find it quite comfortable, and it serves the dual purpose of giving support to my ankle and controling swelling. It fits snugly into both dress and walking shoes alike. It has a removable plastic flexible moulding that can be either left in place (for additional lateral support) or removed for increased joint movement. The brace laces up the front with quality laces, and can be laced tight or loose for a custom fit. I have worn mine for 4 months now, and it still is intact, and all seams are snug.While other ankle braces can be had for a cheaper price, I like this one for its durability and versatility. If you want a good long-lasting comfortable brace, please consider this one. It will not disappoint.konedog
