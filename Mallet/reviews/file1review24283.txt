review/text: I have an outside job. I walk an average of 8-12 miles everyday. Before i bought these i had so much trouble with sore feet and my back would ache every night. since i have purchased these i DONT have back pain from walking anymore. I have purchased a pair of these for every shoe i own I dont leave the house without them...
