review/text: I am a 24 year old male in great shape(just so you all know im no wimp). When I used the trimmer on my Arms the pain was so bad I about passed out(not joking). This may work out better for womens legs because their legs are used to being shaved so the skin is much tougher. It will irritate your skin(similar to when you get waxed: red bumps). It for the most part removes the hair at the root. I myself am going to stick to waxing/Nair. It is much less painful and MUCH Much faster. I would recommend taking some pain pills prior to trying this it will make it much more pleasant. If you do decide to buy one then make sure that you are able to return it for a refund in case it hurts you as badly as it did me. Hope this helps you all out.
