review/text: I have very sensitive skin, especially around my eyes. For years, wearing makeup has tended to create infected eyelashes, even though I gave up mascara years ago, so I am regularly looking in a magnifying mirror with a pair of tweezers trying to extract the offending lash. The tip of my finest-tipped tweezers had gotten dull and my vision wasn't getting any better, so I was looking for a pair of new fine-tipped tweezers and came across these.I have been VERY pleased with these tweezers. As other reviewers have mentioned, the tips are very sharp (they come with a cap for safety), so they can hone right in on a single lash (or ingrown hair) quite easily. My only complaint (and the only reason I gave the tweezers 4 stars vs. 5) is the same one that others have made--it can be difficult to grasp the hair or lash and get enough hold on it to pull it out. This is because only the very TIP of the tweezers come together--from there, they bow out--making it difficult to get a good grip. However, now that I've been using the tweezers for a month or so, this is much less of a problem. It's just a matter of learning how to use this tweezer to its best advantage (at least that was the case for me).Recommended for those with recurring ingrown hairs, lashes, etc.
