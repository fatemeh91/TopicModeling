review/text: This toilet was extremely low and could never hold 400 lbs... My boss almost got stuck on the toilet with this seat... Very dangerous... I need to return this product ASAP and would appreciate any information on how to do this... Again the legs were cheap and couldn't hold weight and the height on this chair was ridiculously low...Thank YouGina Crespo
