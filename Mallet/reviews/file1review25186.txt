review/text: These are more cute and certainly smaller than the ones hubby uses to mow, so they don't hurt my smaller ears when I'm vacuuming, but they do just as good of a job at blocking out the loud wail of the vacuum (or whatever noise for which you need them). I've noticed that if I leave them in for too long while cleaning or if I wear them too many days in a row while on a cleaning spree, my ears get sore and even get little delicate wounds. I've read that this is either from the plugs removing moisturizing wax in exchange for raw spots or wax building up on the plugs and causing them to adhere to the ear canal, ripping skin away when removed, even when removed gently. The best plan, even though they're smaller and softer, is to use them less, so vacuum or mow every few days over the course of a week, instead of several days in a row.
