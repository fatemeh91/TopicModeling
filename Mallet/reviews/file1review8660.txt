review/text: I purchased this to clean the cat litter that spills out of the box. The bristles are very soft, which means you have to be delicate in brushing. At first I didn't like it but soon realized that if they were any stiffer they would sweep the litter everywhere!It's very small and doesn't take up a lot of storage space, plus the round rubber handle is easy to hold.My only suggestion for improveent would be the lip of the dustpan. The edge is not clean and seems to not sit completely flat on the floor. This isn't a problem if you're using this to sweep up big pieces of debris (food, etc), but little bits of litter and dust can get swept under it.
