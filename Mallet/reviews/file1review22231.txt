review/text: This is the perfect Bento box to send to school with an Elementary aged child.The Cost is amazingly low, the fluid and content retention is amazingly high andwhen a Plastic storage container can become an object of interest to not only a schooldistrict Dietitian but also a Special Education instruction team. We have a winner here.Zip-Lock also has a marvelous section of their website dedicated to 100 calorie snacks andchoices. I started using them for Freezing meals or building salads to go in minutes...and was pleasantly impressed with the ease of use and how often I run out of them.It is just one of the best buys for the money spent that I have seen in a long time. I'm buyingagain and hope to eventually have enough of them to build my lunches and dinners to freeze inindividual meals.
