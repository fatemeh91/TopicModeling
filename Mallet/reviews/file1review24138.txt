review/text: I WORKS WELL BUT CHEAPLY MADE. SETTING BUTTONS ON BACK REQUIRE A PENCIL TO CONNECT TO MAKE CHANGES.IF YOU CHANGE THE BATTERIES, THE BACK IS SCREWED ON WITH TINY SCREWS AND ARE DIFFICULT TO GET OFF AND THE PLASTIC THE SCREWS GO INTO STRIPS EASILY. BEST TO JST BUTY A NEW ONE WHEN THE BATTERIES WEAR OUT AS THEY ARE AS EXPENSIVE AS THE WHOLE PRODUCT!!
