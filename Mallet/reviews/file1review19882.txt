review/text: We tried a couple of other options before finding this seat. It is far better than other potty rings b/c it clamps onto the toilet seat so it doesnt wiggle around. The others were hard for my son to balance b/c they moved back and forth on our elongated seat. This one solved that problem. It is also more contoured so it seemed a more comfortable fit for him.It is easy to remove and place. We did finally opt for a built in all in one seat when my son started learning to pee standing up because it was even easier to get out of the way but, for just starting potty training, this seat is quite good - a step above the other potty rings.
