review/text: My husband and I have both used Slimfast before in the past for a fast meal and enjoyed it and lost some weight, too. When Slimfast switched to the "Optima" plan a few years ago (and only sold that) we were very disappointed. The Optima is so disgusting I don't know how anyone chokes it down.When I saw the new packaging and the label said "New" Slimfast I was hopeful that maybe Slimfast made an alternate version. I was still skeptical but I bought a can at WalMart. I made it and added some ice and it tastes like a chocolate milkshake. I am so glad to know that Slimfast is back! I am going to add orange extract to my next one and maybe a banana to the one after that!This 3 can option at Amazon with free shipping is cheaper than my Walmart.I have only tried Milk Chocolate so far.
