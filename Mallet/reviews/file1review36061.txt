review/text: So if I could get past the nastiness of the taste, this might be okay. But bottom line is it is the worst tasting thing I have ever had....EVER! Remember back when you were a kid and you said a cuss word and your mom shoved that piece of soap in your mouth? After tasting this I have to call my Mom and ask for the soap! It is seriously that bad. If you don't have taste buds this is a great product! If you are a Raccoon and eat garbage, Again a great Product! And finally to all of you ogre's out there that swim and eat from their own filth this would be perfect for you!
