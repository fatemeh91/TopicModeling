review/text: Brought this product based on the good review. Took it for a week and got really bad constipation. Did a search and found one person reported the same effect. I know that Spirulina, one the ingredient in green vibrant can causes constipation. I will continue to take this product since I know it's good for my system but not on a daily basis (3 times a week ... Mon,Wed, Fri).
