review/text: I purchased two bottles of these tablets as I've used them for a while and find them to be helpful. When I received the two bottles I thought they looked smaller, and sure enough - the bottles are quite a bit smaller than previously purchased ones. I decided to open one to see the tablets themselves and they are quite a lot smaller than before. No further discount, just sneaky business by the manufacturer. I hate stuff like this. Do they think the buyers are morons? I'll find something else to use for my stomach. I hate to be ripped off!!!
