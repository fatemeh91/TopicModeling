review/text: I have been using this product thirteen year by now, for my five year old daughter that had incredible bad breath and this product really works. The taste of bleach is so mild it you almost don't even notice. But the outcome is phenomenal. My entire family uses this mouth wash that I can go an entire week and still wont have bad breath. In fact I can smell most people breath and I wish I could tell them about ProFresh. Also you can a better relationship with your spouse,family and friends cause you will so much confidence when you are close to them. i personally it offensive when other have bad breath.
