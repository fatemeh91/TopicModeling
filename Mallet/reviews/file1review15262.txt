review/text: Very tasty, my kids loved them. They're kind of messy though -- my three year old got the other layer of yogurt covering all over himself and everything else he touched. These bars are great if you don't have time in the morning to fix a big breakfast -- just eat one of these and you're good to go 'til lunchtime.
