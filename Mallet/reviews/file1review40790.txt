review/text: This is probably the most ill-conceived product out there. First of all, as it has been pointed out in another review, this is a VERY poor quality razor. Without it's soaper, it's a dollar store item. Secondly, the soaper goes all the way around the blade. I don't know about you but I generally shave using the sharp edge of the blade only ... so, after the soap wears out on the leading edge [in about 3 legs-worth of shaving!], it is necessary to give a swipe of the razor in the opposite direction before actually shaving, in order to get any soaping action. This seemed to double my shaving time rather than shorten it. I wish I could express more effectively just how much I hate this product. I also wish I could get that darn song out of my head ... I mean, come on Jewel, it sounded like a jingle the first time I heard it!
