review/text: Slightly more expensive than other proteins, but it does work better than most in my experience. It taste great, and that was a added bonus since I didn't care about taste. You can get cheaper, but I'm happy with the results of this product. I combined it with Animal Cuts and you notice the difference in about two weeks.
