review/text: I had used the Sanford PhD-multi for many years and was greatly disappointed when the local stores stopped carrying it. I tried the Cross Tech3+ and immediately liked it. It is much slimmer than the PhD and looks better. The pencil unit seems to be sturdier than the failure prone pencil in the PhD. I agree with other reviewers that the pen refills are smaller than the full size refills used on the PhD but when purchased by the dozen the Tech3+ refills are not too expensive and last long enough in my experience. It is easy to carry spare refills in their 2-refill blister pack. I save the blister pack and replace one black refill with a red one so I'm always ready to replace either color. I teach large classes and have many students that come in for one-on-one tutoring. Having all three writing necessities in one slim instrument makes the relatively expensive ($30) Tech3+ worth the premium cost over the $10 PhD. I hope Cross continues to offer it. I have lost more than a few pens and broken others. I replace more lost pens than pens that break.
