review/text: I live in a very small apartment with a couple of rugs that I couldn't get my hair out of... While I don't have any pets, I am a bit of a shedder, and I needed something that would get hair out of my rugs, and this thing worked amazingly well. The power in this tiny light thing is out of control. True, a dustbuster is neither the most efficient nor the most comfortable way to vacuum an apartment, but for $30, a little discomfort is as small sacrifice for how well this works and how easy it is to store. Biggest complaint -- and I'm not sure that this is avoidable -- but some hair got stuck very very wrapped around the roller... I cut it off with scissors, which worked very well, but not having to do that would be preferable.
