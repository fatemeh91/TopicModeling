review/text: Our bathroom tub clogged up a couple of days ago - no warning and we tried using one of those plastic Zip-It snakes but wherever the obstruction was, it was too deep to reach with the Zip-It. Normally, I would have used Drano or something similar but Plumbs-Away looked intriguing enough, especially its lack of corrosive chemicals so I figured, why not?The first two tries ended in hilarious failure but that was my fault, not the products. I thought it'd create a tighter seal to remove the overflow valve and then use a plunger to seal it. The problem is that it's hard to put proper leverage with the plunger AND try to activate Plumbs-Away at the same time. The product is POWERFUL, literally explosive, and it basically blew the plunger off the seal and doused me with a few cups of water. This happened a second time until I realized: ok, I need to just screw the overflow plate back on and use a damp towel to cover the gaps (just like the instructions tell you). Third time, I hit Plumbs-Away, I did NOT get a face full of water AND the obstruction - whatever it was - cleared out. Clog gone.
