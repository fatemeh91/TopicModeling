review/text: I've never had much luck taking vitamins before (nausea, heartburn, food intolerances and allergies, etc), but these are great! I haven't had any trouble with them and I've been taking them for several weeks. I do break them in half and take them with a hot beverage ... helps it slide down better :) These are the first prenatal vitamins I tried and I don't intend to try any others!
