review/text: The monitor works great! My wife took it to her Health Care facility and compared readings. The accuracy was within 5 points so it does give a good indication if you might have high blood pressure. Can't go wrong with the price. Best I found after looking at 1/2 dozen sites.Glad we were not in a hurry for the product. Amazon used the Postal Service to ship the item (saves a buck or Two). Seems it shipped from a facility 3 hours from our house and it took 4 business days to get here. No wonder UPS and FedEx are putting the USPS out of business.
