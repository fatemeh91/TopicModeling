review/text: I was totally impressed with this product that I recommended and bought it for my sister. The one that I bought leaked so I was disappointed because I have been bragging about it. It was one factory defect but when I contacted the company about it,I was so impressed with the customer service!They have an A+ customer service! The president himself made sure I was rectified and the wrong was make right. He sent me 3 new back boosters in place of the one I discarded! Thank you very much! This product works and very comfortable support for your back. I use it for my car and it is great for travel as well. It is inflatable to your comfort and another good thing is that it does not feel plastic to your skin since it has a suede-like surface.You can deflate it and put inside your purse when not in use. Great product!
