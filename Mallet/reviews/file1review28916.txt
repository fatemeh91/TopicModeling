review/text: The protein that I received did not have a protective seal on it, that is required by law. I am assuming that it was taken off so that I would not be able to return it. Not using my best judgement I tried the protein anyways. I tried a scoop of the protein after my workout. It make me sick to my stomach and light headed like I was gonna vomit. This lasted about 2 hours. This didn't make since because I was having a great day and a great workout. I have tried this ON protein in the past with no complaints. I think the protein was either contaminated with something or spoiled. I think the sender is trying to get rid of this bad product and knows if they send it without the protective seal then whoever receives it can not return it, per the amazon return policy.
