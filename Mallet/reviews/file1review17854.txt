review/text: When my son was diagnosed with an allergy to my breastmilk I began the tedious process of eliminating dairy from my diet. At first, I thought it was worth it b/c breast milk is best for babies. Well, unfortunately, it wasn't as easy as I thought it would be. My son continued to have reactions to many of the foods I ate. His physical symptoms included: gassiness, fussiness, arching his back, sleeping issues, wheezing, eczema, etc. My pediatrician recommended Nutramigen but I was unwilling to give it up (b/c I thought it was best). Well, by the time he was 13 weeks old I had reached my limit. I had always thought (erroneously)that my son was a poor sleeper and that nothing I did would change that. His poor sleeping began to take its toll on his father and me. Finally, I decided to give Nutramigen a try. I combined my milk with this formula and I was astounded. By the first night he slept a 5 hour stretch. He even started taking two-three solid naps a day. Most remarkable, his stomach issues DISAPPEARED. He was a new child. This past week he has slept 6 and 7 hour stretches. Now, I'm weaning and I'm giving him bottles filled with 2/3 of Nutramigen. He takes it like a chnamp and despite its strong smell seems to like it! I highly recommend this product to anyone.
