review/text: I am 100% satisfied with this purchase. I honestly don't have a single complaint and could not think of a single thing i would change on this razor. I use it to trim my goatee and it's perfect. It does what it's supposed to do. It's got different settings for length. Simple, basic, gets the job done. It's not rocket science. It's just a trimmer, but it works. I recommend this 100%.
