review/text: I bought this tub because, well, it was cheap and folded up nicely for storing. However, once i used it i hated it. My newborn would slip over to the side and bump her head very easily (yes i kept at least one hand on her at all times)or be able to nearly turn completly sideways. It also is a pain to drain, most of the water comes out but leaves some water in the bottom ridge on the side opposite the plug. The only good thing about it is the storage of it..
