review/text: I gave the product four stars because these do work to help get rid of pain. Not only in the foot, but the knees and ankles as well. I felt some relief almost immediately. Arch supporters are probably a good ideal for most people who stand and walk alot. If you've never worn arch supporters, it may take some getting adjusted to. These particular insoles are firmer than most, but do a good job.These items don't weigh much. Heck, they're light. In a single shipment, I ordered 2 pairs and paid almost 12.00 in delivery charges. I think that is blatantly greedy. I have paid less than 12.00 for heavy books. This company can be as greedy as it wants, but they will never get another dime of my money. After I placed my order, the more I thought about it, the less I appreciated it. This seller is actually the manufacturer. I like the product but, will not purchase from them again, period. I shop with Peora, another seller based in California. They ship free of charge. I don't mind paying for delivery, but I don't expect to get ripped off either.
