review/text: I've tried my husband's anti-plaque rinses only a handful of times, and didn't like the way my mouth felt afterwards. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the Plax Anti-Plaque Dental Rinse didn't leave a harsh feeling or taste in my mouth, as I found with the anti-plaque rinses he uses. I have a dental appointment in two weeks, and can't wait to learn if using Plax helps get my mouth a good review.
