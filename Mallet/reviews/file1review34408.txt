review/text: I prefer silicon-based lube over water-based lubes but my experience with this product has only been so-so. The lube lasts longer than water-based lubes and does not condense into sticky jelly but it still does not last as long as I like. It doesn't dry up but my skin just absorbs it like lotion after 5 minutes. The bottle leaks and I get lube all over the bottle, night stand, sheets, and the hardwood floor making everything very slippery. The lube is very hard to clean up (paper towels do not absorb it) so I'm now slipping around all the time like I just polished the floors. One of these days I'll probably slip and fall. It is also very hard to clean off your hands even with soap and water.The worst thing I dislike about this lube though is that it smells like old sweat. It's kind of a turn off for me when when I keep on thinking that my bf's genitals are smelly and sweaty even though it's the lube (TMI I know but I can't say it any other way to make my point). I guess if you just have normal intercourse (without using the lube for foreplay or whatever), the smell would not be much of a bother.I won't buy this again. Time to find another silicon lube with a better bottle and no smell.
