review/text: I purchased this to see if I can clear up my Cocker Spaniels chronic ear infection.. After I mix it with alcohol and boric acid I swab her ears out with it. I find it only stains when it is undiluted. Her ears are better but not cured, she is showing relief and for that we are both happy. I believe if i continue the cleaning routine faithfully she will only improve.
