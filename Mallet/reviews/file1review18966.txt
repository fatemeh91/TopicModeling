review/text: I have a tough beard, and am always looking for anything that eases the discomfort of repeatedly scraping my face with a blade trying to get a good shave. While I've never found the magic lubricant that makes the blade glide unfelt over my skin while the hairs disappear, this ranks up with the best shave creams I've used, and at a reasonable price. (It's hard to trust old memories on this sort of thing, but if I've used better it has been products no longer around or gifts of small containers of products not readily available.)It's pretty basic stuff, really. No odor, spreads easily after extraction from a convenient pump bottle, and offers good lubrication. Be sure to wet your face first and keep the blade wet, as this cream is not oily, and will dry out on you. But if you work with it it does the job well.
