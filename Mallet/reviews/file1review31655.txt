review/text: I think Sweet Success' Power Blend Energy Juice Fusion tastes very good - a lot like a juice box drink. It is especially helpful to wake me up when I need to exercise early in the morning, and it's so great to know that it's healthy for me too! I often drink two a day - one just before my morning workout and one with lunch.I choose not to drink energy drinks like Rock Star, Monster and Red Bull because they are so terrible for you. This power blend drink gives me the energy I need and tastes great! I am very pleased with this product and will continue to use it as part of my daily routine.
