review/text: I love having this cooler attached to my stroller. it keeps thing cool for a very long time. i thought it was bigger. They really should have made it taller and wider. it can hold about 4 water bottles (laying down) with couple of ice-packs. I really havent been able to put anything up right in it, which i think is it major down fall and why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5. also i wish they would have added an extra strap or had a better attachment system. if you dont get it very tight it will lean forward and it does take a good minuted to attach to the stroller.
