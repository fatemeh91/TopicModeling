review/text: I know it sounds weird, but this Avon Slick Tint really works well I just don't like the taste it leaves on your lips, you can definetly taste it...yucky, but It does gloss over your lips, nice and smmoth, I usually put on lip liner first then the Slick tinit and it gives my lips a nice sheer look and feel.
