review/text: I have used SOOOO many product and thousands of dollars on my dry, damaged, relaxed, color treated hair that its ridiculous. I am serious when i say that i should have spent my money more wisely since really my hair isnt THAT important and it could of helped real causes and not my vanity... AANY way, off my soap box...I LOVE this oil! it was made my hair so easy to take care of and has added shine and managability like never before! A little goes a long way. I first dry my hair and add to my ends and work up. Then i finishing styling withmy flat iron or my blower and Voila! beauty in a bottle! Will never spend a penny more on things that promise and do not deliver (i.e chi, tigi, sebastian)
