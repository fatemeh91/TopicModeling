review/text: There is enough power to do the job. The shape of the jar cleaner head is appropriate to the task. I have several hand cleaning tools from Black and Decker prior to discovering this attachment. The one only downfall of this attachment is that it is not interchangable with the other scribbing attachments/tools -- disappointing.
