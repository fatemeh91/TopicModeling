review/text: The product has a nice scent (slightly strong- but does not last). It lathers well and makes feel clean and feel fresh. I am not sure how effective it really is on eliminating fungus but still like the product. It is worth purchasing. I would have given the product 5 starts but the spout on top of the container is not effective and lets more soap out than needed. A top like on a dish soap bottle would have been better or at least one with a smaller opening.
