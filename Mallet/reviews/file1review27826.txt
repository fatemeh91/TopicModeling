review/text: I like the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor, as well as Double Rich Chocolate and Chocolate Mint (the best one, in my opinion -- really tastes like a treat, even when just mixed with water).I have also tried Extreme Milk Chocolate and Cake Batter. Maybe because I'm a supertaster, but these were so overly sweet and chemical-tasting, I could hardly swallow them.I later examined the ingredients and found that these 2 flavors contain sucralose in them. The 3 I listed above do not. So, by my very scientific study, I have concluded that this sweetener just doesn't work for me, which unfortunately means most of the other flavors are also out.Oh well. The top 3 suit me just fine, and I'm able to enjoy them with water + ice, or just water. (With milk they are tastier, but since I'm watching calories, I typically just add H2O.) I also occasionally add peanut butter to the vanilla and chocolate flavors, and it's quite yummy!
