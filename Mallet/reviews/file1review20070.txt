review/text: I have been using this for quite a while and although the vitamin D helped with my mood, I was getting acne again!! I took the recommended dosage, but after a couple of months I just took one a day. I am afraid it "dimmed me too much"! I wasn't angry, but I wasn't in the mood to do anything. My acne still hasn't come back and I also get more for my money!
