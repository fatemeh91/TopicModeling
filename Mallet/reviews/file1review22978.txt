review/text: Easy enough to use, but after a week I still wasn't sleeping (this process takes several weeks) I just wanted to get to sleep like a normal person, and this was not helping. I ended up getting the nightwave sleep assistant and it worked in 3 days. It's also cheaper. One thing that I wanted to mention is that when I bought this, I read all of the reviews (there were only 4, I think) and they were all glowing reviews. After I got this and felt that it wasn't so great, I checked the reviews again, and the people's other reviews, I realized that they only wrote reviews for lifekey products, so they obviously were not impartial. I learned my lesson and now I always check the person's other reviews! Everyone probably knows that, but this is my first purchase here. Oh well...you win some you lose some.........
