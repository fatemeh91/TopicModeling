review/text: I purchased both the 3/4 and full length arch supports because I was not sure which would be best. The 3/4 works best for me because the longer insoles had to be trimmed to fit in my shoes. They both provide good support. I had used Spenco arch supports in the past and was pleased to see they are still a good product.
