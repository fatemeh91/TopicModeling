review/text: I've tried many soy protein powders, and this is far and away the best. I mix it with soymilk and sometimes a little fruit and drink it nearly every morning. It has a pleasant taste (I use the vanilla), doesn't clump, and has a nice consistency as well. I'm never hungry before lunchtime if I drink it along with my usual egg or oatmeal. My local health food store stopped carrying it, and I was very excited to realize I could get it from Amazon.
