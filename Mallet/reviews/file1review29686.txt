review/text: These do a decent job absorbing, but my daughter was 3 months old when I bought these, so I haven't tested them during the worst leakage time (first month for me). They're not contoured at all, so they don't stay put as well and aren't very big so they can move out of the critical position a little too easily (even for me, and I'm not very busty). Also, not being contoured, you have to wear pads over them for shape if you're going to wear a fitted shirt. They do they job, but I'm going to keep looking for something better.
