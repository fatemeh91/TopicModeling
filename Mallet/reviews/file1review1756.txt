review/text: I would highly recommend using this immediately before applying fungal medication topically. Use both twice a day. Most fungal infections take some time to eradicate, so don't quit the treatment too quickly. Several weeks of treatment are usually needed, sometimes several months. This soap greatly aids in treating fungal infections.
