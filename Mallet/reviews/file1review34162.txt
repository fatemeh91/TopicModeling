review/text: This is the best H. ointment I have ever used- have been using it for about 6 months now, and this 3 pack is a real bargain.The only drawback is that it permanently stains underwear, so wear pads. Although smaller than a tube of the usual prescription ointment, it lasts about as long. One of the biggest problems with hemorrhoids is the irritation due to the constant exposure to BM, and due to wiping it after each movement. This product seems to reduce that irritation, allows it to heal, and protects it. Works best if you clean well after each movement (use a nose syringe bulb as a portable Bidet, and use "The Hemorrhoid Remedy" to create a wash solution).
