review/text: A trip to Europe requires a backup battery; so I purchased this as I didn't want to run out of battery in the middle of the day... Between my original battery and this "back up" I took over 1200 pictures and that required a recharge of each battery once on an 18 day trip. One might say "not bad" as a matter of fact it is outstanding as I didn't always remember to turn the camera off between locations and or shots.
