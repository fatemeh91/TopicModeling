review/text: I am restricted to a wheelchair, and so must rely on grabbers,to assist me when reaching for things in higher areas or across wide spacess. I already had one of the ergonomically 18' grabbers in this style and really liked the light wt. and dexterity it allowed me, over many of the other styles. So, I was very disappointd when after the THIRD time I used it, I heard a click and part of the internal workings actually came through the handle, Now, it just takes up space while I try to see if I can get my money back. Needless to say, I am aggeivated and dissapointd. DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT.
