review/text: I had heard so many positive reviews about this product i just Had to try it myself.. Firstly it tastes GREAT.. i ordered the chocolate and used soy & almond milk because i'm Lactose Intolerant. I've only had One day of this and i'm still trowing up and running to the bathroom every 5 mins.. good taste but if you have lactose intolerance DO NOT BUY.. YOU WILL REGRET!!!
