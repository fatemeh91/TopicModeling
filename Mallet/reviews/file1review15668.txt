review/text: Definitely better than sugar and healthier for the teeth too.It has a much more refreshing taste than sugar and I feel just a little goes a long way in terms of sweetness so in the long run if you are not a person who uses sugar on a daily bases this is a great product to get for those few times you may need some sugar for baking or making candy and want a more healthy option for your teeth, your body, and for your family.This brand is one of the best out there, in comparing with other brands I have purchased in a store like "Emerald" and the "Now brand", those other brands did not compare to this one. If you want one of the best Xylitol brands...This is the one to get. Testing them side by side, this one wins!I have cooked with this and it works fine for baked goods...but if you have a baked good that requires you to make a syrup from sugar...Xylitol does not work the same way, it will crystallize back after it cools and will not stay in a syrup state... but I am sure there is some trick one can do to make it stay in syrup form after heating (maybe adding a little cornstarch or baking soda who knows!) but you will have to research on it! let me know if you find out :)Update 2012:It seems the company has changed the package sizing from 2 lbs (909 g) to 1.75 lbs (795 g) and still charging the same price without explanation! They have decreased the amount of Xylitol and are still charging the same high price which really is unfair..We are now getting less product for what we are paying. Also, a lot of the companies selling the product here on Amazon are taking advantage. You need to make sure you do not pay more that $19.00 for this. I am so disappointed in the company and Sellers on Amazon as this was my favorite brand.
