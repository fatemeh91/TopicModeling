review/text: I've tried several potty seats and I'd have to say this is the best. Easy to clean, simple to use and I think it's nice that it's adjustable. However, at least for my son, it still allows urine to be sprayed up on the toilet seat (not on any one's legs or clothes which is a step up in my experience). So I still have to wipe down the toilet seat when I want to use it. I've been so frustrated with other potty seats and the mess they made (on clothes and toilet seats alike) that I was really hoping this would solve all those problems. I will say that the amount of urine is much less than some other seats and it doesn't allow the pee to get on his clothes like I've experienced with other potty seats that had gaps in all the wrong places. I believe the problem is that his urine is hitting the side of the toilet bowl and splashing up underneath of the front of the potty seat an on to the toilet seat. I really don't know how you'd design something better though that would reasonably take care of this. Overall, I believe this is probably the best potty seat out there but at least in my experience, none of them will deliver a dry toilet seat (or at least with my child and his peeing dynamics :-) ).
