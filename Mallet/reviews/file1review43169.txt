review/text: I thought the purpose of a daily shower spray was to eliminate or minimize the physical maintenance of the shower. I found that after a thorough cleaning and then using this product liberally at the end of the week there was still a good amount of buildup on the glass and tile which required manual cleaning. What this product will do is make the shower smell great all day long but what this product will not do is eliminate the need for weekly manual cleaning. You make the call but I would pass on this item until the formula is modified to be more effective in reducing the need on manual cleaning further than the current formula.
