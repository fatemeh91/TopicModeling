review/text: After 22 years of smoking, and trying to quit too many times to count, I tried this product beginning on 1/25/2005. It is now 7/20/06 and I remain a non-smoker. I'm not saying it was an easy thing to do, I certainly needed support and prayers too. But, IT DID work!My husband is now using it to quit smoking. He's been smoking 1- 1 1/2 packs of cigarettes a day for 24+ years now, and has tried numerous times to quit. Now that he is using this product, he has gone without smoking for 10 days! He is doing quite well, and has confidence that he will continue to be a quitter.You still have to be strong in your resolve to quit smoking, this isn't a miracle drug here....I don't believe there is anything out there that will completely take away 100% of your cravings and desires. If that were the case, what a perfect world we'd live in, right?!? But, this WILL HELP you, if you're ready to help yourself.
