review/text: I was looking for a toothpaste without fluoride, since my two-year-old daughter hasn't gotten the idea of rinsing and spitting out the toothpaste. I use Tom's of Maine's adult toothpaste, and was pleased to see this fluoride-free children's product. My daughter loves it so far, and I'm happy to be supporting an environmentally friendly company.
