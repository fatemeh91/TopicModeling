review/text: Lost my Apothecary 7-sided pill organizers on vacation. Bought this turtle thing as a replacement. Very disappointed. Difficult to open & close. Can't open all the little compartments at once to see the whole week at a glance like I can with other 7 compartment pill boxes. Also this one will not stand on end in the medicine cabinet like the Apothecary 7 sided pill box. The turtle can't compare to the 7 sided Apothecary pill organizers for quality, convenience & ease of use.
