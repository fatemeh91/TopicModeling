review/text: I have been using Mach3 for over 5 years now. I got hooked on it since the first time I tried it; I have a thick beard and it is very hard to get a smooth shave. I usually shave every three days when my facial hair has grown enough to get the "ounf" effect. The blades slide over my beard and erases it: No pain and no mess. If you are a first time user, you'll need to buy the handle; this item only contains replacement blades. Oh, and one more thing, you can reuse these blades several times before disposing it; there is a tiny marker (just like the toothbrushes) which tells you when it is time; or you could just do like I do and replace it every month (8 to 10 shaves).
