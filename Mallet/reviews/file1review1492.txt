review/text: I have been fighting warts in the palm area of my hand for years with various brands of 17% solution. It's unsightly...all that white coating...and only seemed to put the warts into hibernation for a couple of weeks only to have them reappear and initiate pain.I used the wart stick by scraping a little bit from the stick with a flat toothpick (it has the consistency of a lip balm). Then I applied the waxy substance directly on the warts, followed by applying a waterproof tape made by Nexcare. 12 hours later I removed the tape and scraped off any skin that the wart stick wax killed. I waited till the next morning and repeated this procedure.Waited again, till the next day and did this one more time, and when I scraped off the skin, the warts came with it, leaving little craters where the warts had been. These were deeply embedded warts and in three days they were gone. I just can't say enough good things about this product, other than you had better get some before they take it off the market. That's what seems to happen with products that actually WORK.
