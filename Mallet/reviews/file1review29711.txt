review/text: I have tried literally every brand of disposable and washable nursing pads out there. If you are a new mom in the first few months of nursing buy disposable (Lansinoh are my favorite). They absorb a lot more than any washable ever will. However, I found that after a few months (I nursed my son for 13 months) I leaked much less and could wear the washable ones without fear of looking down and finding a soaked shirt. The advantage of washable is that they are softer and cheaper over the long run. That said, I liked the Medela ones better than Avent because they were larger and less noticeable under clothes. I do own several pairs of the Advent ones though and they work fine.
