review/text: I wasn't sure what to expect - I've never taken whey before, but from everything I've heard about it, I expected to be underwhelmed by the taste. My "trainer" warned me that any decent whey would "taste like crap." I can't wait to hear his reaction to it.Well, this does NOT taste like crap (not that I actually know what it tastes like, of course). It tastes great - I mixed it in skim milk with a vintage Tupperware shaker, and it was a lot like how I remember Nestle Quick tasting. I can completely understand how that one reviewer manages to get his kids to eat it as "chocolate milk."I didn't even notice a weird artificial sweetener aftertaste, which is usually an issue for me.So this choice was a win, win win, as far as my tastebuds and lean muscle mass are concerned.
