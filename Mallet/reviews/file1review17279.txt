review/text: It's a pretty bare bones model. Trimmer. Charger. That's it. But it holds a charge on standby for about a week. Which is fine. I trim my beard once to twice per week and I just make sure to plug it in when I leave for work so that it's charged fully for the evening grooming ritual.The blades are titanium and apparently require little or no maintenance. I like not having to oil the blades. I really don't miss that ritual! I love that the guards adjust with an easy click. It's sturdy enough to where it doesn't click to a lower setting from using it. If you've used other trimmers, you know that often if you push against your face too hard, the trimmer will click to a lower setting and chop WAY too much beard. Glad this doesn't do that.It has a good, balanced weight and a nice grip. Even if your hands are damp, the grip is solid. Since I leave it under the sink until I bring it up to charge, I don't really miss not having a charging stand. I try and keep as little as possible on my sink area. But for those who need to trim daily, this might not be ideal.It's a great, value priced trimmer. And for a regular user like me who has kept a beard for the last 10 years, and used many terrible trimmers in the past (I'm looking at you Wahl!), this razor fits the bill. Highly recommended.
