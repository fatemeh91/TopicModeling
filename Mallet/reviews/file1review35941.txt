review/text: This ionic toothbrush is the most amazing toothbrush I have ever seen! I have always had painful gums and my mouth produces so much plaque. Going to the dentist for scaling required novacaine. The electric brushes damaged my gums and caused sore areas that got infected. BUT this ionic toothbrush gently removes plaque -- even under my gum line!!! My teeth shine and even squeak when they are cleaned with this brush. I no longer have a plaque problem! This brush is a Godsend. It uses no electricity either. My dentist is very impressed with my lack of plaque now!
