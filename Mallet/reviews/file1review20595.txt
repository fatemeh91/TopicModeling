review/text: Want to keep you electric shaver investment functioning like new? These replacements are necessary and do work well. You don't have to change the blades often (18 months) unless you have very heavy facial hair and then I would recommend every 12 months. You'll know when it takes longer to shave than usual; having to over and over areas that used to come clean in one or two passes.
