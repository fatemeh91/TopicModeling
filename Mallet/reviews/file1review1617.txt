review/text: I had a very stubborn wart on my right index finger, very close to my fingernail. I tried everything to remove it, from the over-the-counter freeze-off stuff, the typical paint-on salicylic acid (Compound W and another store brand), and even went to a dermatologist (twice) to have it treated with some pretty brutal acid that appeared to work at first but didn't completely get rid of the wart. After this, the wart came back with a vengeance, and I was at a loss as to what to do. After looking at the reviews of this product, I thought I'd give it a try. The wax-based formula makes it easy to use (the paint-on liquid kind is hard to keep only on the wart and also tends to dry out in the bottle fairly quickly.) The Pedifix took a while to work, but I used it nightly and put a bandage over the wart, then took the bandage off in the morning to let the wart dry out during the day. At night, I filed the wart with an emery board and applied the Pedifix and a bandage. About 3 weeks later, my wart is completely gone. The process was pain-free too. Great product!
