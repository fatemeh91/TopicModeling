review/text: I bought these as an addition to many other rechargeable AA batteries. I have had bad luck with them so I just tested them in my lacross bc-900 charger and they came up with 650-850 mahr capacity (2650 mahr rated). fully 1/3 or the rating. I have many older AA's that work great and hold up for years. I never fast charge and occationally run the conditioner function on them.for some reason, these are not holding up.I just bought a bunch of eneloops. we will see how they hold up.
