review/text: I'm reducing my carb intake (doing a half-arsed version of the paleo diet), and I hoped to use this -- in french vanilla flavor -- in my coffee as a sort of quick breakfast routine. It wasn't unpleasant, but I no longer looked forward to cuppa joe.This stuff EXCELS in banana shakes, tho. (Banana, milk, ice, and this....Mmmmm!) Makes it taste all professional and thickens it up too!
