review/text: I have been using these for years, and I swear by them. I have flat feet, and these are the only insoles that I will even consider. I can even run in them! The only downside is they have recently started using molded plastic arch supports, which tend to slip forward when I put the shoes on and sometimes when I'm walking, especially over rough terrain. I much preferred the older solid, rigid foam arches they used to have; those never slipped!
