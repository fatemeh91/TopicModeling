review/text: I have been using this for 2 weeks, and all but one night, I was sound asleep within an hour. No hangover, no morning grogginess. When I would awake in the middle of the night, I quickly fell back asleep. NutraSleep is just short of a miracle. I had tried another product that worked fairly well, but didn't act as fast. I can't believe how effective this product has been. I take 3 - tried both 2 and 4 - and found that 3 was sufficient to produce sleep. The ingredients appear to be safe in such a low dose. I can only hope this solves the sleep problems wrought by menopause. I like it so much, I've set it up for auto-delivery :)
