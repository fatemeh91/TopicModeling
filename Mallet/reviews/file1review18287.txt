review/text: I thought I was buying the OVER SIZED moist heating pad, but it just resulted in being big enough for my hand......when I needed one that would be big enough for my entire back.....I guess the name OVER SIZED, made me think it was big enough. I think the description of the item is deceiving....I still want the one that is sized for the entire back, have not idea what size that would be....
