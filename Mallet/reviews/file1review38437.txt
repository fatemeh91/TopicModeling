review/text: I've always considered myself someone with a high tolerance for pain...but after getting this thing, I may have to rethink that. First off--the thing works. You want to get rid of a huge amount of hair from the root, this little baby will work wonders! You want it to be painless...FAT CHANCE. When I first used it, I did not em-joy the amount of pain issued by this little bugger.The first time you use thing thing, the only thing coming out of your mouth will probably be AAAAAAARRRRRRGGGGHHHHHHHHH! (and if you're creative like me, a whole lotta expletives as well!) You *will* have red, and possibly bumpy skin afterwards...and if you're really lucky, you may even have a few little pinpoints of blood where more stubborn hairs used to reside. But rest assured, all of those pesky side effect will go away--and yes, the pain does get less each time you use it afterwards. If you have a low tolerance for pain, can't pluck your brows without crying, or can't even pull a hair on your head, it probably would be best to stick to a razor or nair. I've had my Emjoi for over 2 years now, and I have graduated into bikini area and underarms Emjoi-ing...a good tip is to use the Emjoi, then take a good warm shower. I've found that Tea Tree Soap and a good lotion after the shower helps the pain subside greatly as well.
