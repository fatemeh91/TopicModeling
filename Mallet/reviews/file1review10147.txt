review/text: These are pretty standard heavy-duty yard bags. They stand up, are easy to fill, and heavy-duty enough that the bottom doesn't rip out. For that I give them 5 stars.However, you can get EXACTLY the same thing (with a different printed logo) at Home Depot for $1.88/5 pack! That's 4.8x more expensive! I've tried lawn bags from Fred Meyer, Ace, Home Depot, and Amazon. HD and Amazon are the thickest and heaviest - but what a price difference!I ordered these because I was being lazy and had not conducted a careful price comparison. If you don't live near a Home Depot, these are a quality product, but you can absolutely find much cheaper alternatives elsewhere.
