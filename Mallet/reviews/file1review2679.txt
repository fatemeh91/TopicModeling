review/text: At first I thought they were comfortable (I got one for each foot)but after wearing them all day the part under my toes start to press into the bottom of my big toe and bottom of my foot. They also did not keep the top of my toe from getting red. After wearing them a few days I decided it my toes feel better without them.
