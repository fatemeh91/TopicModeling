review/text: I remember seeing advertisements for this product and couldn't imagine that that little red ball would dissolve in my dishwasher. Well, it does. And not only that, previously cloudy glasses came out crystal clear!We've been usingCascade Complete All-in-1 ActionPacs Dishwasher Detergent, Fresh Scent, 30.5 Oz, 48-Countand everything seemed to come out clean. The only thing I noticed is that my plastic refillable drinking bottles seemed to come out making the water not taste quite right. Of course I blaimed the dishwasher .... that is until I got theseFinish Powerball Tabs Dishwasher Detergent, Orange Scent, 32-Count. We started using these as soon as we got them and, not only were previously cloudy glasses suddenly crystal clear, but the plastic refillable water bottles no longer have a detergent taste. I even noticed that the inside of the dishwasher seems cleaner.We are running low on these now, so it's time to buy more. We'll only use these Finish Powerball Tablets from now on.
