review/text: The French vanilla creme in my opinion tastes great with milk, however with water it is just as bad as any other protein I have tried. The product is safe as advertised and one box lasts quite while, all pros. I am gaining significant muscle mass and definition 4 weeks into my routine, and I have had no consequential side effects stemming from this use. Would recommend!
