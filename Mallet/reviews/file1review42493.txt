review/text: I purchased this protein powder after spending the weekend with my sister who had some. We put it in our fruit smoothies every morning and I loved it. I bought it from Amazon as soon as I got home and it has been one of my best purchases this summer. I put it in my fruit smoothies after I work out, and my kids would sneak a sip and then want one of their own. I now make protein smoothies for them every morning and they love them!This powder is so smooth, tastes good, and has the best nutritional value I have found. We have the smooth banana flavor and I will probably order the chocolate in a week or two because my husband likes to mix it with his milk to make "chocolate" milk.
