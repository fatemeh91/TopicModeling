review/text: This is a great protein source. In my experience, it doesn't mix as well as Optimum Gold Standard 100% Whey Protein, when I mix it in milk but I get the same result, when i mix both of them in water (may be because i am using more water than needed). But it tests great, I usually make it half an hour before to insure that it mixes well.
