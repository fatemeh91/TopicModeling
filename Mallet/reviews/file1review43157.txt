review/text: Method changed the formula of the Daily Shower. They called it: "upgrade the daily shower formula to include powergreen technology, which is made of plant-based solvents." It is most definitely NOT an upgrade. The product no longer works. The previous product (I found an old bottle during a move) kept my glass shower and tile clean and clear...the new formula however makes the shower glass streaky, there is now a white residue buildup on the tile that is not all soap, I think it is partially cleaner. I have been using the new formula for one week and am on the search for a new product that works. I would love for them to return to their original formula.
