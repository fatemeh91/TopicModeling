review/text: I purchased this mask for use while on vacation, sleeping in a bedroom that gets bright early morning light. The front of the mask was very comfortable, but I found the elastic band too wide & the Velcro closure too thick & uncomfortable, to work well for me. Being a side-sleeper, unless I had the band on my head very snuggly, the mask would push away from my eyes & allow the light in each time I placed my head on the pillow & when changing position from one side to the other. I couldn't seem to make it feel comfortable & also stay in place -- so, I ended up not using it.
