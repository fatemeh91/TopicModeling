review/text: After reading the article in Consumer Reports I thought I'd go ahead and give Solgar a try. Knowing that it ranked so well on the heavy metals seemed like a nice piece of mind. I've been taking it for a couple weeks so far as part of a recovery smoothie following my workouts. It has been a quite effective product. I don't hurt the next day, which leads me to believe it's working. Considering I workout for about 1.5 hours a day, that seems like a pretty good benchmark. The flavor is good and it mixes easily. I would definately recommend this product to someone looking for a protien supplement.
