review/text: The Waterpik flosser is wonderful for dental care. I use a low power to flush out debris and then a high power for removing plaque. The Waterpik at high speed seems to pulverize plaque, which then can be rinsed or brushed away. I am expecting a very good checkup by my dental hygienist.I discovered an additional use for the Waterpik that I was thinking of patenting until I wrote this review -- now all of you will know about it. I save one of the tips for back-flushing sprinkler heads from my irrigation system when they get clogged. I previously spent about $18 a month replacing sprinkler heads and now I just clean them and re-install them.
