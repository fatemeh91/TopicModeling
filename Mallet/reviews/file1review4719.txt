review/text: A friend recommended this product to my sister and I. She is a 24 year old female and I am a 27 year old female. We were both excited to use this products because my friend loves it. My sister and I are both workout and try and stick to a healthy diet. After 2 weeks of taking Herbalife, I contacted my sister and asked her what she thought. WE both agreed we felt VERY bloated and gassy. It was horrible, we also both went up on the scale! We would have a shake for breakfast and lunch. Something in this shake is not right, I should have read the ingredients before purchasing because another friend said there are ingredients that should not be in Herbalife. Bottom line I think this shake is for people who literally have a shake for breakfast and lunch that is it. I mean i like to snack on almonds, fruit, etc. But i truly think if you are someone who doesn't enjoy/have the time to eat this product is for you. For someone who enjoys eating healthy foods this is not a great product. I am so upset with the results. I will stick with Kefir!
