review/text: I've had my Taylor scale for several years now. I'd always felt it was a bit strange with its numbers and that it was "off" somehow. Sometimes the numbers would seem too high, sometimes too low. But, I figured I paid a pretty penny for it, so I'm not going to just toss it out. I thought that I could trust it to at least give me a "heads up" if things were changing significantly one way or the other.I lost a significant amount of weight this year. How much? I'm not really sure. Why? Because I weighed myself on Saturday and saw 163.4. OK, that's about 2 pounds over my normal, but acceptable for the holiday season. Then I got on the scale again on Monday and it read 178.0 - a nearly 15 POUND weight gain!!! I got on and off the scale dozens of times while trying to hold back tears and every time it came up with 178.0. I was devastated. I had thought I'd lost about 45 pounds. Now I have no idea how much weight I actually lost and what my current weight might be. The scale at the gym told me 170 lbs last night... but even if that's correct, that's a 7 POUND weight gain!!! What gives?This scale is a piece of crap. Any device that misses weight gain over a period of time sufficient for the user to gain between 7 and 15 pounds is really a piece of junk. And now I also have the great pleasure of feeling as though I was asleep at the wheel, letting 1/3 of my hard-earned weight loss creep back despite the fact that I weigh myself several times a week.DO NOT PURCHASE THIS SCALE!!!
