review/text: This was perfect for my needs. Each section is small enough to take on the go and each compartment was big enough to fit 9+ medications including the oversized horse pills. With 4 compartments, it will hold ALL the daily pills needed and keep them organized so you can take them when it's time. The only thing that worries me is the little plastic lids that seem like they might wear out quickly. So far so good though! No problems.
