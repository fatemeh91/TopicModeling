review/text: I've been taking this for a few weeks having one dose in the morning and one before bed, but Im still waiting to see any noticeable benefits or changes. The good thing is that I dont see any negative effects so Ill keep at it for now. Regarding the taste, HOLY CRAP! it tastes awful (smells awful too), but Ive found that mixing it with a little orange juice sort of masks the taste. I read some reviews about people taking it with just water, I did that once , but never again, those people are Champs.
