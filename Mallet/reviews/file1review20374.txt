review/text: My last few pairs of glasses were completely destroyed from improper cleaning over time. My last pair had "scratch resistant" lenses and in 2 years they were scratched to the point I could no longer wear them. Yes, this was entirely my fault. So when I got new ones I decided I'd take better care of them and ordered 4 of these clothes to keep at my office, my home, my car, and in the case with my glasses. They do a great job cleaning finger prints and smudges as well dirt and grime without scratching the lenses. The storage pouch fits perfectly inside the case with the glasses as well so I'm never without one. I did standard shipping and received them via USPS in 2 days. I highly recommend this product!
