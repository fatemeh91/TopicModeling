review/text: This brush was recommended by my daughter's dentist after she had her braces put on to ensure thorough cleaning around the appliances. The brush is fantastic! It stays charged for almost two weeks after the initial charge, comes with a carrying case so she can take it to school for mid-day brushing and it has a two minute timer to ensure she brushes thoroughly. I would recommend this product for anyone who has a child with braces, as she actually enjoys brushing now!
