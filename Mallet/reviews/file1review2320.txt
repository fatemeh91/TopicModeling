review/text: I too had multiple surgeries for crossed eyes - three times in my life. As a result I developed extreme dry eyes around 55 years old.There is nothing more uncomfortable...painful than severe dry eyes and no prescription eye drops worked...on my Doctor's recommendation, I searched and searched for Omega Capsules that would relieve my pain...and found nothing......until I discivered Thera Tears.These pills have saved my life and I will never be without them. (BTW, I do take 3 in the morning, every day.)
