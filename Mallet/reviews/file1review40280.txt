review/text: Got this for my girlfriend, and she loves it. A friend of hers got one of a different brand. My girl loved the idea of a warm bear that smells like lavender. I took a stab at this one, which was much cheaper than the one her friend had, and she really loves it! She warms it up for a minute in the micro and it puts her at total ease, espeically when she is not feeling well. The bear is also constructed really well, so I think it will last a while.
