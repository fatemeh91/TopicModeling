review/text: My grandfather had problems with his legs for years before he died,and I may have inherited the problem as well.Hopefully not as severe as his was.Over the last couple of years I've noticed the side of my right leg going a little numb if I stand in one spot too long without walking.I also had a very severe injury before Christmas,2010,and it is not well yet.I decided to order these compression hose to see if they would help,and they have.I don't know how they work but they do.However,they are extremely hard to put on.I ordered the proper size,it's just the tightness of the compression material in them is hard to pull up and you have to work them up a little at a time.I have worn them several times after getting back to work and they feel fine for being on your legs a lot,which I am.However,being a man,I wore them a time or two with my underwear on,and I couldn't keep them up good,so I tried wearing them with no underwear to see if they would stay up better and they do.(I don't mean my comment to sound nasty or vulgar,we are grown adults here,telling the truth is always right).I reccommend these hose in a persons' proper size for anyone that has problems with their legs.No matter how severe or how slight.They are quite comfortable even though they are thicker than a woman's normal sheer pantyhose,and I have found them leaving my legs feeling much better after I return home and take them off.I have even left them on at home on some days until the evening time when I would get my shower and go to bed.I am quite pleased that I decided to purchase these hose and try them for my legs.If anyone purchases themselves a pair of these they won't regret it.
