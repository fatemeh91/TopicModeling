review/text: I have been using this for about a year now and I love it. I used to think I needed an antiperspirant / deodorant, but this has been just as effective in controlling odor, and with no harmful crap. Yes, I might perspire more, but amazingly, it doesn't smell. The deodorant itself has a nice scent. Highly recommended.
