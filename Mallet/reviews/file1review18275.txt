review/text: $15 for not even 3 fl oz of this stuff? What an amazing ripoff, simple proof of successful marketing. This stuff is far too runny. It's too thin to create much of a glide on your skin. It dries very quickly and you'll find that you have to reapply several times. Ladies, if you're looking for a lube that can honestly live up to the title "premium," look for Liquid Silk or the Sliquid line of lubes. You'll get more than twice this amount of lube AT THE SAME PRICE, and get a far superior product.
