review/text: This is a pretty good clipper guard. I really like how the metal clip is spring loaded so it can fit many different clipper blades. The plastic is also very hard, not flimsy like most guards out there. The only drawback is that the spring can be too weak at first causing the guard to detach from the blade. However, once the clipper blades form a slight groove in the plastic, that should solve that problem. All things considered, I am very satisfied with this product, and I have not seen a better replacement attachment after ordering several.
