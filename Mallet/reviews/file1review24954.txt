review/text: I've only been taking them for a month. My cycle is very irregular often skipping up to six months with no pattern or warning. I'm not pregnant yet but my cycle did come on after a two month hiatus so I'm optimistic. My focus was more toward getting my body regulated and once it is focusing more on getting pregnant. I do plan to order a second bottle and will share any progress with my next purchase.
