review/text: I hated flossing before I bought this. I still don't love to floss, but this flosser makes it tolerable. I always had problems getting in between my molars and wisdom teeth with regular floss, but this flosser makes it easier to clean back there. Shipping was fast, and so far no problems with it. I've owned it for a couple of months now, and it's still going strong with the original battery. The only problem I have with it is that it did not come with the mentioned picks. It only came with three flossing replacement heads. Besides that, it's a wonderful product.
