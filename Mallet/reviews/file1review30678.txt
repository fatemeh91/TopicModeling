review/text: I've owned this razor for about a year now, and I'll never go back to the triple and quadruple bladed razors that are all over the place. First of all, I no longer get the razor burn and ingrown hairs that I used to get with my old razor. I used to shave as rarely as possible, because it was such a horrible process, but this, along with a shaving brush and soap, makes me not mind it at all. I am still lazy though, so I don't shave everyday. Which brings me to another advantage of this razor: if you put off shaving for too long, this razor doesn't pull out long hairs, like contemporary razors do, it cuts them off clean, which is a godsend for lazy people like me. The learning curve is not as big as other people seem to think, just make sure not to rush your way through the first few times you shave with it.
