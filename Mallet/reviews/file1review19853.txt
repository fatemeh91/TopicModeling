review/text: When my daughter first showed an interest in using the toilet, I bought one of those cheap toppers from Walmart. After a couple months I realized that it was starting to fall apart. The handles started to come off and then the seat started to tear exposing the foam on the seat. It was really gross...Then I realized that I should of invested some money for the Baby Bjorn toilet trainer I originally wanted.My daughter was so excited to use her new toilet trainer when it came in the mail!She ripped the box open and ran to the bathroom to try it out. She loved it so much she would not get off the toilet.I really love the quality of this product.There is no tearing foam or handles that will eventually fall off, cleaning is a breeze, and it adjusts to different toilets. So it's great to take on vacations! Oh most importantly since I just had another child she can also use it in the future without it falling apart! Definitely a good investment!
