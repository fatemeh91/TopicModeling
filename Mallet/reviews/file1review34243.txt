review/text: This stuff is amazing. Nothing in the store compares. It's a bit tingly at first but within 1 day its a 90% reduction of any "issues". Granted I rarely have "issues" but nonetheless, this product wasworth every penny, you get three tubes and it will most likely last an "average" person a long long time. Doesn't smell strange. Does what it should do, relieve some of the pain and suffering of the occasional "issue".
