review/text: I can see how this would be the perfect brush for delicate items. Crystal, anyone? But...I don't have delicate items. I have lots of things like the coffee pot that frequently get built up residue that will only come out with a stiff bottle brush. This is not that kind of bottle brush. The bristles are very, very soft. You might be able to irritate the skin on your hand with it if you rubbed the brush on it about a thousand times. Don't try it - this is just a way for me to let you know how soft the brush seems to me.
