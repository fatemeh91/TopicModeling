review/text: I got this shaver 3-4 months ago and would have to say that i am pretty happy with it. It does not get as close as a razor, but it does shave pretty close to it, but the difference is, with this shaver as compared to a razor (mach 3) i can shave against the grain under my chin and not get and razor bumps or burns. Thats what i love about this shaver. Some people complain about having to buy the cleaning solution every two months and for such and such a price, but if you do things correctly it will last longer, and the price is about the same as if you were to buy replacement razor cartidges, so i don't see why they complain. It does take a couple weeks for you and your face to get used to the razor, but that just means that the shave won't be as close as it can be the first week or two. Once you learn how to use it, it works excellently. You have to shave against the grain, and it helps if you pull your skin tight with your free hand, and try and move it and your face so that the surface of the skin your shaving is flat. It also shaves a lot quicker than a razor, it only takes me 5 minutes to shave my whole face with this, whereas a razor would take me about 10. Overall, i'd say great performance and a great buy!
