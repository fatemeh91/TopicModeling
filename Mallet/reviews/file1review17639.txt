review/text: My first trimmer was the Remington MB-250; bought one for myself and my son. These were terrible - Mine would give one trimming per charge. The one I got my son also gave one trimming per charge --- and ran at half speed! Clearly a poorly designed product. The MB-200 however is a different story. Both of the units I bought have performed flawlessly. I get about eight or nine trimmings per charge! Compared to the lousy MB-250, you wouldn't think the MB-200 was made by the same company. Or, maybe the guy who designed the MB-250 was fired.
