review/text: I saw some reviews here telling that the green-to-black ones are good. So I trusted it. They really are crap too. Sony Walkman WM-101 runs longer on carbon batteries than on those. My Olympus D-580 runs out of power within 20 shots, while a pair of TDK KR15 1000MAh rechargeables give power to about 60 shots.A full charge leaks in under a week. This is a real shame for Duracell. I used to trust that brand.Don't buy this item!..
