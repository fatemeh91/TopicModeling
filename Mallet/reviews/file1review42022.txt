review/text: It was difficult to determine from the internet whether this charger was the right charger because model names and numbers of the shavers were not given, just the model number for the charger. It was the wrong charger. I threw it away rather than hassle with a return. Chargers should be easier to purchase over the internet. When purchasing a charger, be careful.
