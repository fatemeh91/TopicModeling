review/text: I purchased this for my wife who is pregnant and works on her feet all day, and she loves it! She has had it for over a week now and used it almost every night. The water jets are powerful enough to relax her feet, but can be pointed away if they cause discomfort. The water heats up fast as well. Our only criticism is that you cannot set a temperature, you have to turn on and off the heat to maintain a comfortable temperature if you to not like the heat at the set high temperature. Overall this is a great product!
