review/text: I am very into nutrition, and over the years have been trying different multi-vitamins. I have to say that liquid vitamins are above capsules or pills, mainly because it absorbs into your system faster due to not having to break anything "solid" down. Also, the fact that this has "greens" in it is an added plus, especially on those days you're too busy or don't get the opportunity to eat your veggies for the day. I think for a liquid vitamin it tastes good, with a pinnaple taste.
