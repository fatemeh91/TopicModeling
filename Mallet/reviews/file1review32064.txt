review/text: This product saved me from having to leave work with an embarassing excuse. During some specific times of the month, certain unexpected things can happen if you know what I mean. ANYWAY - although the manufacturer claims it doesn't remove those kinds of stains that well; it worked VERY well. Keep one in your desks ladies...it really works.Oh - and I've used it on coffee stains, spaghetti sauce, soda...the usual "oops" kind of stuff. Works great!
