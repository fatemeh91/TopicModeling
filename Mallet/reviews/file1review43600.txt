review/text: I purchased this blood pressure monitor for my elderly mother. I had a few requirements. 1) That it was easy to use, 2) That it was easy to read, because my mother has poor vision, and 3) that it produces good output. This machine does all of the above and comes with a an alternative power source too! We are pleased.
