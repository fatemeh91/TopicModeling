review/text: The belt works great! I use it for jogging, and my belly doesn't bounce at all! However... the back of the box says "Doesn't show under clothing" Which is a blatant lie! It is impossible to hide this thing! Its enormous! You could hide it under a baggy sweatshirt, but that is about it!I highly recommend this for the support, but if you expect to hide it... I wouldn't count on it!
