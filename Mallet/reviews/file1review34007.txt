review/text: This is truly a miracle cream! I have had psoriasis for years and have been using prescription cortisone creams with very little improvement. Shopping in Whole Foods one day, passing the healthcare products section, I spotted Psorzema cream and figured it was worth a try. In less than one week there was such a remarkable improvement in my condition that both myself and my physician husband were absolutely astounded. It is greaseless, odorless, and extremely quick drying. Swanson has the best price with super fast shipping. Anyone with psoriasis or eczema should definitely give this product a try.
