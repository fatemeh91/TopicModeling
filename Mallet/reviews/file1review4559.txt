review/text: I only use a manual razor as I have yet to find an electric one that will cut my whiskers without seeming to pull them out. I prefer the multi-blade razors as they always seem to do a better job and the best I have used so far it this Gillette Fusion. The five blade head shaves my face smooth on the first pass and I do not have to often reshave an area over. Multiple shaving over the same place tends to give me razor burn.The flexible head follows the contours of my face and always keeps the blades at the proper angle for a clean close shave. The single blade side is good for trimming my side burns and my mustache. I also like the Lubrastrip and when it is gone it is about time to change blades. It is a good indicator of the razors usage.The grip elastomer coating on the handle makes it nice to shave with as you can get a firm grip on the razor even with wet and soapy hands. Overall it is a good design and it works well for me! I get a close comfortable shave.
