review/text: I'm a coffee/tea drinker; I bought the stripes to try to combat some yellowness from that. I wasn't expecting supermodel teeth-- just a noticeable improvement. The bottom line is that they didn't work. I can think of a million things I wish I'd bought with the money instead.I also experienced the tooth sensitivity that other reviewers have described. It has been 3 days since I stopped using them, and my gums still do not feel right. I cannot believe this is truly a safe product for repeated use.In addition, I am a small person with small teeth. The stripes barely covered enough teeth for me.
