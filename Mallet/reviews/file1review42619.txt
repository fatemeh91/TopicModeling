review/text: The label on this vanilla product states: "Award Winning Taste." I tasted dairy products as part of my career, and this is a dairy product, especially the way I drink it--with milk. It would be interesting to know exactly which awards were won, who were the judges, and on what basis was this/these award/s won. To me the flavor is less than award winning. The lack of added carbs makes it a little flat and it has a slight powdered milk tone. It is certainly drinkable, but some days I wonder whether there isn't almost, but not really quite a hint of being objectionable in flavor. It certainly mixes well. When stored for a couple days subsequent to mixing the body is still thin, which is fine because the product is not purchased as a heavy milkshake, but that varies by the consumer.
