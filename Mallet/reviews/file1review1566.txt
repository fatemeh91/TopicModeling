review/text: ok We just got this stuff 2 days ago & I HAVE to tell you how amazing it is lol. Nope, it has not removed my daughters Wart or my Skin Tag (hanging mole thing lol) But it has started to!I put it on my daughters wart the day we got it following the advice of a previous reviewer (TY For the tips!!) I used a regular bandaid though because that is all we had.. I took a hole punch & used it to get threw the plastic part of the bandaid.. then took a Qtip & cut the tip off of it.. Used that to dig the medicine out because ours is indented for some reason.. But I used a big glop & cover it up..After the first day it turned all white & red around the edges.. Just put the second round on last night.. anxious to see what it looks like tonight!Now me. I put it on mine just yesterday. I already peeked at it and it too is all white now! Amazing.. Simply amazing! I will update when it actually takes them all off.. I have a few I need to do & my son has a wart as well.. Fun fun fun.But for under 6 bucks.. and no pain.. it is worth the wait!
