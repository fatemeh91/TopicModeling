review/text: These protein bars taste great and are perfect for those times that you're on the road and can't eat.They are super filling, satisfying and relatively healthy. I suffer from low blood sugar and can't always eat at regular intervals due to my erratic schedule. I always keep one of these in my purse and it ensures that I don't become ravenous during the day.These are also perfect for sitting through long classes. Rather than eating a sugar-laden candy bar from a vending machine I eat one of these instead. I stay full longer and don't get a "sugar high" as I do with regular candy.
