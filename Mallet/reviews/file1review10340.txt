review/text: I thought I was going to be the only person to odrer batteries off the net, I see I'm not alone in my nerdyness.These were a tad expensive, but I was working 15hr night shifts at the time (holidays) & couldn't afford the time to stop & get batteries. They came Fresh & ready for use in my flashlight. :)
