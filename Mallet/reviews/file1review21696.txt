review/text: When I had my firstborn lil girl, I was given 3 different types of baby tubs.... The plastic ones pale in comparison with this one! It's soft enough to keep baby safe from bumps/bruises. When my girl was still too small to sit up on her own, I just used one of those foam bath tub thingies to assist in keeping her above the water level ;) Now that she can sit up she loves to hang on to the sides & splash around ... I feel secure with this tub b/c if she slips backwards it's cushioned on the bottom to keep her lil noggin from hurting ;)
