review/text: I am on my first cycle with Animal Cuts, and have had great results so far!My workouts are three times what they normally are without these supplements. I have increased energy, more stamina and feel fantastic when my workout is over. I have felt no caffeine crash, 'jitters', mood swings, or any other negative side effects. The diuretics in this will make you go to the bathroom more often, which is the job of diuretics - fine as long as you keep VERY hydrated! I will note that I am only taking one dose per day, when the directions and most serious bodybuilders take two. This is my first fat burner, so I plan on taking my time. I am not male nor a bodybuilder, so I'm not supplementing like one.This is an addition to a regular workout regimen and healthy diet. Please don't knock this stuff if you aren't doing anything else to lose body fat. It's common sense that magic pills don't exist, but so far it's a wonderful addition for me! Two thumbs up!
