review/text: This little flosser is great, while it works. My son got one and for the 3 or 4 months it worked it was great. When it stopped working (yes, I tried a few new batteries) I contacted Oral B (owned by P&G. They were kind enough to send me a coupon for free floss. They said the Hummingbird was in this group. No one sells it anywhere around. Ever try to use a Mfg. coupon online? It won't work. I contacted them about it and they said they were sorry, but they couldn't send anything but the coupon.
