review/text: The product simply did nothing for me. I tried the finished off the bottle, took it at recommened amount and also tried larger quantities, absolutely no affect. I would say don't waste your money on this product but it could work for some allergies better than other. But I can attest it doesn't help my allergy which is primarily to ragweed.
