review/text: Out of the package this thermometer read low (96.8 and 97 degrees without the supplied probe covers) on 2 different human subjects instead of between 97.6F to 98.8F expected for healthy humans. Over the course of 15 minutes, using the oral method with one human subject, where the probe was inserted under the tongue with enough force to cause minor discomfort, the readings varied from 96.9F to 97.5F on repeated insertions and measurements. Given this, I can not rely on this thermometer to accurately gauge temperature for anyone with illness. More testing is needed, with an accurate temperature reference. However, human trials are the most realistic in terms of intended usage, and this data points to an accuracy issue for the Vicks thermometer. Aside from the accuracy concern, it has nice features such as a flexible tip, acoustic signals, and an easy to read display.(Following this review, I purchased a German-made Geratherm Mercury-free oral thermometer, initial tests indicate very accurate readings {98.2F for a healthy human}. The downside to this thermometer is that it requires 180 seconds to read, the upside is that it does not require batteries and it appears to be very accurate. After years of purchasing useless electronic thermometers, I finally have one that is accurate!)
