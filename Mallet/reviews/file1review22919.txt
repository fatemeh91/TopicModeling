review/text: I just love this thing - so easy.It really works, simple!!No electronics, just run it around the carpet & it picks up fuzz & stuff. Easy to empty, too.A nice, simple cleaning tool - like the old days!!The only reason why i didn't give it 5 stars is because you have to put the handle together, but it's fine & it stays together, etc.
