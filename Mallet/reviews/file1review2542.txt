review/text: It won't do fine hairs and does not pull out all hairs at the root, some hairs may clip off and not be unrooted, and when you try to go over the area again it won't get those hairs. Basically, it works about as well as waxing,but without the mess. It is about as quick as shaving (though I just dry shave).Now, let's talk a bit about the pain. It does hurt, but not the kind of pain a woman can't handle. I use it for armpits and bikini area. It hurts but it's quick and with longer lasting results than shaving. If you do legs you should get into the habit of using the exfoliating pad because it does seem to cause much ingrowing of hairs. I don't have that problem in other areas though.There is a learning curve in determining how close to the skin you go, if varies the type of hair and skin. You have to experiment to determine what is most effective maximizing uprooting more hairs and minizing the pain.Definitely worth the price and pain. When is this thing going to be stocked again? I want to get at least 2 more for girlfriends as gifts!
