review/text: Oral-B Humming Bird power flosser and pick kit.Oral B Hummingbird Flosser Starter Kit Unit, Assorted ColorsThis product is very good. Help me to do my daily routine to floss. I got the 1st one for free when I bought the tooth brush. I try it first it really hard. But after get use to it. This Hummingbird is the best. Not only cut the flosing time but also get to the hard to reach area very easily and compact enough to bring them anywhere, it is a little expensive but I use it over and over and over again so ending up not that bad when you thing to use the regular floss that you have to throw them away not only the area that we use but also the area that I use on the finger what a waste and probably will be more waste on the land field that this small thing that you could use over and over again. I never try the pick it but I would try that when I receive the order from Amazon I do not know I hear this thing is no longer available and one more thing since I use this hummingbird my mirror is cleaner. Because if use the standard one they are so messy and hurt my finger (because it hit teeth and finger skin ouch)
