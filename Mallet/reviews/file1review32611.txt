review/text: I'm very health conscious and this tea was recommended by my cardiologist. She stated that drinking organic hibiscus tea supports a healthy heart while lowing bad cholesterol!! I did not hesitate to buy for the cause of healthy habits. This tea which was drank without cream and sugar of course, was tart and flavorful. The tea being certified organic was a plus but it's really about the taste and health benefits. The color of the tea was red (lemongrass I was clearly thinking a lighter color) was pleasantly surprised. I would recommend this company and product.
