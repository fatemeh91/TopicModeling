review/text: I love Rainbow Light vitamins and supplements; I have never had any complaints with the quality or the company. However, if you look at this seller's pictures, you may believe (as I did) that the Prenatal Petites require you to take one tablet per day. When I got my shipment, I realized that the photo was not of a Prenatal Petites bottle, as you are actually required to take three tablets daily. Had I known, I would have found the other Rainbow Light prenatal that only requires one tablet daily.
