review/text: I have had hemorrhoids since I gave birth 23 years ago. They periodically flare up, and I had an extremely painful hemorrhiodectomy a few years ago. I have also had internal banding 5 times!The last three weeks, I have had stomach problems and diarrhea leading to a horrible flare up. I have tried absolutely everything, including horse chestnut cream from the health food store. That was very temporary relief, but as soon as it dried it was hurting again. I was in agonizing pain, and the only thing I could do is take 4 or 5 baths a day to feel slightly better while I was in it.I got this cream yesterday, and after using it twice yesterday and once this morning, I feel like a new person! I think my stomach wouldn't stop hurting because of the pain, so I continued having diarrhea because my body felt so stressed. Now that the pain is relieved, I feel better all over! This truly is the miracle cream I've been looking for! It does have that "oriental" herbal smell, but I don't care! The hemorrhoid that was either thrombose, or very close, is much softer and less inflamed.I just can't tell you how happy I am and what a great value this product is!
