review/text: I always go with chocolate flavors when it comes to protein shakes. I just didn't think any other flavors could taste good enough to be actually tasty.But if you like bananas, this could be a perfect flavor for you. It tastes really good and it provides my body with protein in needs at night and after workout.I also added this protein powder to pancakes and the results were fantastic!! Yummy protein banana pancakes, for a banana lover like me, were like a miracle!
