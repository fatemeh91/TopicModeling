review/text: I had been using an old beard trimmer, and finally replaced it with the MB-200. The old one had been yanking my beard hairs, incredibly uncomfortable. This one just whips through and quietly, efficiently trims everything just right. It is SO much better! It lasts a long time on a charge. I don't trim my beard every day, so a single charge will last at least a month. I had really been hoping for one that took rechargeable AA or AAA batteries, but this is absolutely fine. Maybe I will need to throw this one away in 10 years, when the battery fails; if so, still a wonderful purchase.
