review/text: This is the first BP monitor I have owned. I did much research beforehand. All operates as advertised. I cannot verify it's accuracy but from comparison to other machines it seems to be on point. It's easy to use and fast. I have not utilized the machine on battery power but assume it would operate just fine as the AC current. The mean averaging of the past 3 usages is especially helpful as you get a very accurate reading overall. I heartily recommend this device.
