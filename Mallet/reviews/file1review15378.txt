review/text: Solaray - Oil Of Oregano, 150 mg, 60 softgelsI have been researching the benefits of oil of oregano. It is said to be a natural antiseptic, fungicide, fights bacteria and viruses. I couldn't wait to find a good product. I purchased some Solaray Oil of Oregano the health food store and began taking it. I didn't experience any immediate results from one capsule so I started taking two. Still no results.I had read reviews about how strong oil of oregano is and how it can burn your skin or tongue so I decided to cut open one of the capsules and put it directly on my skin. RESULTS: NOTHINGI decided to taste it. RESULTS: There was no strong taste or odor. No burning sensation. The bottle says , "In extra virgin olive oil" and thats about all I tasted. There was a mild smell of oregano. I did order some real Oil of Oregano from Amazon. It is being shipped from Greece. When it arrives I will do a comparison of the two. In the meantime save your money and skip the Solaray unless you want to waste your money on weak or diluted oil of oregano from Solaray.
