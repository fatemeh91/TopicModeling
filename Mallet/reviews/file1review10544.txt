review/text: Okay, I got this for my dad to be safer than his regular cane. This is made of cheap metal (it just has that thinner than average cheapie look). It adjusts easily, but the locking screw to hold it once adjusted sticks out a bit (you don't see it in the photo but it's enough to catch on things). The bottom plate with the four little legs is a cheap looking piece of metal and it's not evenly spaced....the rectangle is "off" so it looks funky. The price was right but I'll likely return and spend a bit more to get a more solid appearing cane. I bought this in black so can't report on the other colors.
