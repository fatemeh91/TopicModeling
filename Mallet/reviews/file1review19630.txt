review/text: This is a third "copy" of this seat that we have bought from Amazon - that is how much my wife and I liked it. It is well designed, with smooth lines, rubber stabilizers and no rough or sharp edges or points. Fits easily and reasonable securely over any solid adult toilet seat - no need to lift it. We use these at home in every bathroom and take one with us when we travel. My three-and-a-half y.o. daughter is able to pick it up from the floor and place properly on a toilet herself. The round dial that locks it into place does not have to be tight, thanks to the rubber bars on underside. Therefore, even though not really locked in place, it does not slide. Obviously, that is VERY important. If she felt even a bit insecure on it, she wouldn't use it. We had two other seats (from different manufacturers), both of which wobbled if the child did not sit straight and still. Which kid does?!So the Baby Bjorn continues its reputation for quality products that are really well designed. I highly recommend this seat to anyone with a toddler in a house!
