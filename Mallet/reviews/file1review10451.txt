review/text: I needed Tums for my pregnancy-induced heartburn, but I was nervous about the berry fusion flavor. I expected it to be sickeningly sweet, but the flavor is actually great -- much better than original Tums. I will definitely order this flavor again. I like Tums because I know they are 100% safe to use in pregnancy, and they help ease heartburn and sour stomach.
