review/text: There are a billion reviews on the product as a whole. Obviously, it's completely awesome, great calories to protein ratio, mixes really easily, etc.I usually only look at the reviews now if I'm feeling experimental and want to try a new flavor, so I thought I'd leave a review on a less common one.I just received the Mocha Cappuccino and it's great. Not a super strong coffee flavor, but a hint of that plus the usual chocolate. I actually typically mix instant coffee with mine in the morning.
