review/text: You must use care when microwaving .Too hot and it will burn themore sensitive skin of yourthroat.I am left-handed and found itdifficult to "close" the collar.The manufacturer should havemade it with a hook and loopfastener. As it is, the strapattaches directly to the fabricof the collar and eventuallythe material will tear.
