review/text: I am using this to help keep my acne under control. You have to be careful about the dose, I take it twice a day for a total of 50,000 iu which is a lot. I check my liver function tests on a regular basis. Liver toxicity has been reported on doses as low as 15,000 iu per day. Check with your doctor before you take this product. If your doctor has no idea, find another doctor!
