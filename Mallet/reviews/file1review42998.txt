review/text: The only reason I purchased this product initially is because it was my only option for a natural shower spray from Amazon. I thought the cost was bit high, though. Well, I must admit, I've just purchased my second case. The product works well (just start with a clean shower) and smells very nice - a light, pleasant scent. If the cost were lower it would have my 5 stars.
