review/text: We breed Doberman Pinschers and tape cropped ears on all our puppies. Zonas tape is the only tape we use because it's the healthiest. If you try to use regular bandage tape it won't allow the ear skin to breathe thereby causing infection to set-in and you end up with a very sick puppy! Never use anything other than Zonas for ears!!
