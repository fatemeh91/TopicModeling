review/text: I am a former police officer and based on my experience, this unit seems to be both accurate and consistent. Obviously, you don't want to use it with fresh alcohol in your mouth, or it's going to give you an artificially high reading.I note that one person gave this unit one star, and then said that the unit was reading high while acting as if it's the unit's fault that he apparently got arrested for DUI. First off, if in fact the unit was reading high (as much as 50%, as he put it), then why in the world did he get behind the wheel of a car? I can see a beef if it reads low, but how can you blame an arrest on a unit that (maybe) reads high?Also, when in doubt ***DON'T GET BEHIND THE WHEEL!!!*** Driving while intoxicated is very serious business. It's not just about getting caught by the police, but more importantly, you could kill or maim some innocent person or yourself. I've seen a number of cases firsthand where young children with their lives ahead of them were killed by drunk drivers. Try living with that on your conscience, not to mention the legal and financial consequences.But the bottom line is that I recommend this breathalyzer. It's compact, relatively inexpensive, and the user replaceable sensor is a big plus. Just remember that it is a useful tool, perhaps even entertaining, but it's certainly not a substitute for good judgement and common sense.
