review/text: I wasted my money on this item. With brand new batteries it never reached full vibrating potential. We even tried several batteries. It was as if it was already warn out and it had a bad odor. My dh cut the cord to assemble it with an old one we had hoping it was reach full vibrating potential and it still did not. Now I surely can not return it. Money lost. This company surely did get over on us. Never again.
