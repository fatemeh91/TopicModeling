review/text: I had two sets of these that I used regularly for 4-5 years or so on long family vacations -- took them camping, in the mountains, to the coasts, everywhere. They were fantastic. I always kept one set charged in the camera, and a spare (charged) set in the camera bag, so I was never caught without batteries.Until I lost one this summer and purchased a couple new sets.I get about 20 photos from the set in my camera, and the set in the bag loses its power within a week. They are worthless -- and I'm thinking about mailing them to a Duracell corporate office demanding my money back. Indeed, until I get a refund, I'll never touch a Duracell again. Unfortunately, I don't have my receipt or packaging, so returning them to the store I bought them from is no longer an option.I half wonder whether they accidentally made a massive bad batch. If so, they should create a recall program for people.
