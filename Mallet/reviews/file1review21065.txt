review/text: Husband purchased this pad for his back and also bought one for a neighbor. He says it feels really good and he likes the little trigger that allows him to adjust the temperature. Neighbor is also very pleased. He had used one at his doctor's office and recommended it. Two happy customers!**UPDATE - you need to be VERY CAREFUL with this heating pad because you can get nasty burns if you leave it on too long. Hubby got a bad burn on his hip. He admitted it's his own fault. If it's getting too hot, you let loose of the handle. Obviously, he did not. It is NOT a problem with the pad. The pad does what it's supposed to do. The person using it has to be a little smarter than a bread box when using it.....I'm not knocking the product. However, I AM wondering what part of "it's getting hot" my hubby didn't understand! It's taking a long time to heal. Oh, brother!
