review/text: I had Lasik surgery a few years ago. Ever since then I have severe dry eyes. My eyes would be heavy, dry and that made me feel miserable. I have tried almost all lubricant eye drops and they do not work for me. Finally I found Thera Tears Omega-3 and I decided to give them a try. It has only been a week and I feel a huge difference. My eyes are less dry and tired. I hope this continues and I am really hopeful that this will end my search for the ultimate cure for dry eyes.
