review/text: I'm a 28 year old Asian male who has sensitive skin. I shave every couple days with a Merkur razor and Truefitt & Hill Ultimate Comfort Shaving Cream. I've tried many shaving creams such as Nivea, Aveeno, Gillette Gels, Polo Sport, and Neutrogena Shaving lotion and none of them have out-performed this product. I also like the fact that is unscented so it doesn't clash with my aftershave, deodorant, or cologne.This particular product is more expensive than most shaving creams, but you won't need to use a large amount of it. It doesn't irritate my skin and leaves my face smooth. I've always had a close clean shave while using this shaving cream with a single blade safety razor.
