review/text: I first tasted Gin Gins when I was leaving a restaurant in Manhattan and took a few to go. They were refreshing and seemed to settle my stomach after the big meal I had just eaten. The next time a friend said she was going to that same restaurant, I asked her to bring me some. After that I had to have them so I went on Amazon. Gin Gins are delicious with just the right amount of ginger taste-not too overwhelming, but very soothing. Try them!
