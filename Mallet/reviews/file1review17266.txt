review/text: And I had a few, even Remington's.This model is stronger, more durable and its battery lasts for much longer than the other models I had.I've been using MB-200 for almost a year and I can count on one hand the number of times it needed to be recharged.One important note: when I bought the trimmer, it cost $14.77. As it's strongly recommended, it might not be as appealing for $24.99.
