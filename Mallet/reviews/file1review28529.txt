review/text: The only other whey protein powder I'd tried in the past was EAS Myoplex, specifically a flavor they tried to make palatable by calling it Cookies and Cream. Imagine gagging down a tumbler of pus from a large abscess.What a relief to find Optimum Nutrition's 100% Whey Gold Standard. I got a couple 5 lb containers each of the French Vanilla Cream and the Extreme Milk Chocolate. I mix either with non-fat milk, a heaping tbsp of PB2 powdered peanut butter and some whole ground flax seed meal, and the result is killer. Awesome for breakfast, before a workout and after.I'm sold on this stuff.
