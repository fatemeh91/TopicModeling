review/text: The brush is good quality & does fine for glasses & baby bottles. I, unfortunately, bought it to use to clean swing top bottles that I use for kifir soda. It will not fit through the opening. I decided on this one after another reviewer said that they used it to clean beer bottles. Their bottles must have larger openings than mine.
