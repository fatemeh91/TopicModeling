review/text: I bought this for my 18 mo. old daughter. I also bought the potty chair from babybjorn. While the potty chair is convienent, my daughter seems to like the toilet trainer a little bit more. I like it because it fits on any toilet and is very sturdy. I was not afraid of my daughter falling or being pinched. I would recommend this to anyone!
