review/text: I'd had an older version of this - which worked out, but of course hurt to use. I'd long since lost the power chord for it - and couldn't find one that would work for it.I've read a bit that suggests removing hair from the root over a period of time will eventually lessen the hair that grows back - plus shaving still leaves a dark shadow on my skin since my body hair is dark and my skin is pale.I gave this model from Braun a try, after waxing my legs using Moom - the theory that If I can get a decent portion of hair removed initially, then using the epil will be fairly painless. I found its easier to do the wax thing and get huge sections taken care of at once, then to go over everything with just the epil soft all at once. So that worked, and I noticed that this epil wasn't as painful to use as the old one - plus it has some new neat attachment gadgets that came in handy...I decided - well, Lets try the underarms - I've never used anything but a razor before to remove hair from the underarms, and was a bit nervous to try - but I gave it a shot... yeah - it hurts, but not unbearably - I'd shaved the day before, and the epil was able to pick up a one day stubble - but, also due to shaving, the hair is still picking its time to grow back - so am using the epil a bit each day and the hair is almost all gone now - each morning the growing in stubble is less and less - so once my under arms are completely hair free, there will be no more dark shadow either! And, this will make it relatively easy to care for if I stick with it to maintain the hair free-ness. Same with the legs and bikini line.Apart from permanently removing hair via laser surgery, I think a combo of Moom waxing and using this epilator is the best way go go (and no more razor burn either!)
