review/text: Worked alright, a little waxy, but stayed on my teeth well while whitening, easy to use. It didn't whiten as much as I'd hoped, but then again I did notice a difference. My teeth were definitly whitened a few shades. I think you would need to use it more than once to keep it up and really see a difference. Did not make my teeth too sensative either.
