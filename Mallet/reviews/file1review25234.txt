review/text: I don't know what some people are talking about when they say these batteries last only a couple of hours and that they last only 1.5 years. I have had a pair of RS65 for roughly tens years, and I am only on my third pair of batteries, which means that I get about 4 years out of a pair, and I get about 4 hours out of each battery. I use them daily for hours on end and try to use them until the run right out. Maybe that makes a difference, I don't know. Maybe they work better when they are used and recharged often and regularly.
