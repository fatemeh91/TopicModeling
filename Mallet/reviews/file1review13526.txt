review/text: I have a form of arthritis in my left ankle and have limited movement in it. So, I have to have a lift either installed onto my shoe or put in as an insole so I don't put much strain on my knee. These insoles are the perfect height and have literally been a life-saver to put in my shoes that do not have lifts! Plus they are super comfortable and flexible!
