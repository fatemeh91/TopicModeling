review/text: Initially I got to try these gloves because a friend brought them over for my wife and I to use them to keep our hands clean when cleaning firearms (the solvent is not fun to get on you and smells horendous) or even for when I paint my tabletop miniatures. The gloves don't cause any reactions, there isn't a ton (if any) powder to be left on your hands, and they fit really well. They aren't weak gloves either, so no need to worry about them tearing. Highly recommended.
