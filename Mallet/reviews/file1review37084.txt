review/text: I bought this Hummingbird Flosser kit thinking that it could do the same work that my tired and circulation restricted fingers do. It failed in getting between even my not-so-tightly spaced teeth. I guess I'll stick with Oral B Ultra Floss since it works. If your teeth are very tight/close together, I would suggest that you not buy the Hummingbird flosser.
