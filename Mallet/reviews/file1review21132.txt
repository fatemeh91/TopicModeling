review/text: This is our 3rd Thermophore Moist Heating Pad and have given 2 as gifts for our parents. My husband has back problems and he uses it every day for pain management. He has used them since the mid 80's and swears by them. Every once and a while I get to have a little time with it. It is great because you do not have to add the moisture to the pad, it gets pulled out of the moisture out of the air.
