review/text: When I was pregnant with my twins I started experiencing severe hip pain (to the point that I couldn't walk sometimes) by week 17. I tried belts that just went under my belly and they were a joke. This "cradle" took away almost all of my pain. Somedays I would get tired of putting it on and think I could go without it... I never lasted more than a couple of hours before I went and put it back on. For those that say it's uncomfortable, you have to give it time. Remember the first time you put on a bra as a 12 year old girl and how foriegn it felt??? And you thought "How am I supposed to wear this all day every day???" It's like that... you put it on for the first time and you think "No way" but you get used to it and after awhile it's just another undergarment. (One that happens to take away pain!) Also, I don't know if this has anything to do with it, but I didn't get horrible stretch marks with my twins like I thought I would. I think this helped with that too!
