review/text: My husband and I take this at the first sign of imbalance. We have been using this product for years. It is made up of great stuff, like garlic and vit-c as well as an array of other natural defense-building ingredience. They say an apple a day, keeps the doc away (make sure that's an organic apple these days!) And I would include this stuff in your immune-building repertoire.
