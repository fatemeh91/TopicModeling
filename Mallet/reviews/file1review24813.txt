review/text: When I started taking it, I thought everything was going ok, but I would get so exhausted day after day. My back ached all the time, I got headaches all the time and then...It made me start my period on CD22. I had very high hopes for this month since my HSG test came back with great results. Per my OBGYN, I stopped taking it and I'm just sticking with my Pregnitude that she recommended from the beginning.
