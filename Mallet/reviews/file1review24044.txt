review/text: The shipping price of $9.95 was ridiculous - I ordered my speakers, which is about 1000 times heavier than the tiny studs I ordered, and I paid a significant amount less for the shipping. I recently got my cartilage pierced and purchased these studs for them. They were really cute so I took a pair out of its package today and tried them on in my original holes (in my lobes). The posts were way too thick and it is impossible to remove the back from the post. My ears are in so much pain and they have been pierced for years. Why in the world would anyone pierce ears with these earrings. Do NOT order these earrings.
