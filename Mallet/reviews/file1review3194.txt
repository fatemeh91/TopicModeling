review/text: I am not one to toot my own horn, but I have a lot of sex. As a result I go through a lot of condoms and have tried all sorts of brands, flavors, shapes and sizes. All those fancy vibrating ring, glow in the dark condoms can be interesting to try, but they are far too expensive for every day use and most sacrifice feeling for some gimmick.You need a work horse condom, something thin with good feeling, yet strong enough to withstand the rough sex women want. Cost is also a huge issue as any drug store is going to RIP YOU OFF if you have a lot of sex.These condoms are thin, cheap, and a good size. You really can't beat them, so I buy them 100 at a time.bow chikka bow bow
