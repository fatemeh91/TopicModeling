review/text: I developed a staph infection in my eyes! After 2 visits to my opthamologist, he recommended that I use Thera Tears capsules. I couldn't find them locally, but on Amazon where I ordered them. My Doc told me that these capsules would help unclog the oil glands in my eyes. I believe they are working. I've only had one flare up since I started taking them.
