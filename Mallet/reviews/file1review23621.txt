review/text: I bought this product to use with my toddler. Most other products cause her to develop a rash and she needed some help with her oily scalp. This product has solved both problems! It is gentle enough for me to put in her bath for bubbles and I can wash her hair and it doesn't sting her eyes! It smells funky coming out of the bottle, but mixes with water to make a very nice scent. It leaves her hair silky and clean and her scalp has cleared up also. My tweenager also uses this and we have seen a decrease in the pre-pimples on her face : )
