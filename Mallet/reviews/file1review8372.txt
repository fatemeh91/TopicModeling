review/text: I bought this as an &#34;add-on&#34; item. It serves its purpose and does exactly what it's meant to do. I like that I can use this is any of the bottles/coffee tumblers I have. I have a feeling it will clean my food processor lid quite well when I don't have time to throw it in the dish washer.
