review/text: I tasted a 1 ounce sample which had 100 calories. Since this is an ENERGY BAR, I assume it is for people working out running, biking, hiking, or some physical activity where the person eating the bar would be burning calories. So, don't eat these energy bars thinking they are low in calories. I mean, they are made of fine ingredients and wonderfully tasty, but real food has real calories.This bar was quite delicious and the quality of the ingredients comes right out in the first taste. The flavors are all enjoyable and well balanced. Superior to most energy bars that I have tasted.
