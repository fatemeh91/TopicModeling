review/text: These pills dissolve as soon as it hits your saliva, activating not only the caffeine but the terrible aftertaste. It the same flavor recognizable in Mad Croc Gum, Jolt Gum, Five Hour Energy, among other products that add caffeine and have a less then desirable aftertaste. The pills easily get stuck in your throat so drink a lot of water with them. Would purchase again, but prefer the caffeine/green tea pills I was taking before.
