review/text: I like this unit - I owned a similar Remington model for several years, and was happy with the job it did. Other units I have tried in the past year have left me frustrated, so I was happy to purchase another Remington.However, one of the most attractive things about the newer model was that Amazon's product description page clearly stated that the head was washable. (In fact, this was stated more than once.) However, upon receiving the item, I find that the enclosed instructions specifically advise you not to rinse the cutter assembly under water. I know that the space under the cutter head can be cleaned with the supplied brush, but I find the process unpleasant.The other minor drawback to the MB-200 is that, unlike my older model, it cannot be operated with the cord attached. The adapter cord only recharges the batteries.So overall a good product, but not quite as advertised.
