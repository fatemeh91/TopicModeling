review/text: I am very petite and a 25 pound weight gain during my pregnancy was substantial. The Prenatal Cradle works! I went from barely being able to stand long enough to make dinner to being able to shop all day. It provides the necessary support and really makes a difference for both lower back and pelvic pain.
