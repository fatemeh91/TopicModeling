review/text: I didn't buy this product from Amazon but wanted to share my opinion of it here.This stuff tastes absolutely horrible! Since I am over 175 lbs I had to take the larger dose. I came close to throwing up when I took it, even if I took a sip of water to wash it down I dry heaved for about 15 minutes after. But I figured it would be worth it. Well a week later and I am still struggling with my milk output and my stomach is in knots all day from this stuff (I hear it can cause stomach upset)I was taking Fenugreek before with decent results but needed more so I thought this would help, I think I got better results with Fenugreek now that I think about it. With this, I dont even get the "maple syrup smell" that you are supposed to get (this is how you know you are taking enough and it is active in your system).Another review suggested that this product seems to work better for skinny moms below 175, maybe that is the case, because it didn't work for me either.I will be switching back to Fenugreek today. What a waste of $30!!!!Maybe the health food store I bought it from will allow me to return it? Who knows.
