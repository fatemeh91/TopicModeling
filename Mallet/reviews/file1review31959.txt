review/text: I learned about this supplement when I discovered I had food allergies to all dairy products. I had severe mouth ulcers. Originally I was in so much pain I used prescribed steroids to deal with it. Since then I discovered this supplement not only battles this situation, but also provides needed vegetables for a daily requirement, and last as I am unable to have traditional yogurt which has probiotics this also covers that requirement as well. The taste was a bit of a challenge at first but I adjusted to it and just drink it now. You can make it taste better with juice or something but I just drink it quick so no biggie.
