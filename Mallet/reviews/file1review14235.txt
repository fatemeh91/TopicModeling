review/text: I REALLY prefer silicone over any other lube, but I had to get a water-based lube for my Fleshlight (silicone breaks down the Fleshlight material and also other toys). I was using Astroglide, which is HORRIBLE because it gets so sticky when it dries out, and it's so "stringy" (hard to explain, but I'll spare you since this isn't an Astroglide review). Other water-based lube does the same thing. As with all water-based lube, this one does dry out after a while (unless of course you're using it for intercourse) but at least this one doesn't get sticky when it dries out. That's a BIG plus!
