review/text: This product is GREAT! I've waxed for 12 years. It's messy but effective. I have two small children and NO time whatsoever to wax anymore. With this epilator, I can stop and start at any time removing hair. It's very effective and barely hurt on my legs. I do admit to using the massaging head for the underarm and bikini line. The massager was very helpful. It took me about 15 - 20 minutes to do my entireleg(s), underarm and bikini line. That includes using the razor head to touch up. I'll never go back to waxing.
