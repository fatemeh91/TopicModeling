review/text: I regulary buy this product because of the single blade that's located on the back. It's great for doing line-ups on your beard. Thank god you can get this product a little cheaper on Amazon because they charge you an arm and a leg for this product anywhere else, and you don't get much use out of one cartridge; about 4 uses, like the previous poster stated. Hopefully, one of Gillettes competitors will come out with a similar product that's competitively priced.
