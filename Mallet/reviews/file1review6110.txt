review/text: The mop head has to be replaced after one mopping of a floor and tears easily. EVERY SINGLE REVIEW has been bad, which should tell you something. Finally, if you are considering the Mr Clean Magic Eraser mop, same issues. Don't bother.I love the Magic Erasers, which you use to clean walls, so I had high hopes for this product as well. But it just isn't worth the money or storage space!
