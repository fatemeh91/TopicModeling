review/text: Before using this product, I used another Daily Shower Spray. The other product had a fume after spraying that my husband and I did not like. I am so glad that I found this at the Target store because this spray works as well, but doesn't have that chemical-based smell. After about a week of using this spray, quite a bit of the soap scum on the tub door was breaking down, and the bath tub floor remained dirt free. I have only been using this for a week now, but I'm already seeing the value of this product. My husband and I really like this alternative to cleaning the tub using elbow grease, and the added benefit is that we don't have to deal with that terrible fume. Thank goodness!
