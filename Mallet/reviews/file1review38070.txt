review/text: The Myoplex Lite line is very good as a whole. The Peanut Carmel Crisp is tasty, not overly peanut buttery, and has actual half-pieces of peanuts on the outside! I like the "crisp" style of bars versus the chewy, taffy-like consistency of other energy bars, including other bars made by Myoplex that are not in the Lite line.15 grams of protein, so not the heftiest of the available bars. 42% fewer calories translates into 190 calories for one 1.9 ounce bar, with 40 coming from fat. 26 grams of carbohydrates, 12 grams of sugar. The vitamin and mineral content for one bar is good, it won't give you your daily requirements but will get you a quarter or half of the way for most of them.The only drawbacks are: 3 grams of saturated fat (ick!), those 12 grams of sugar, high fructose corn syrup (not a good source of sugar/sweetness)and palm kernel oil.All in all, a very tasty bar that makes a good pre-workout snack or meal on the go.
