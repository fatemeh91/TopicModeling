review/text: This is one of the tubs of protein I keep in my regular rotation.The three things I care the most about protein powders are nutritional content, taste, and blendability, and this passes all three with flying colors. This has a great ratio of high protein to low calories and fat per ratio. I always get the chocolate, although I've heard good things about many of Elite's flavors. It mixes well and tastes great with either water or skim or soy milk just by stirring or shaking, and is even better when I spend the effort to actually use a blender (milk, vanilla yogurt, fruit of your choice, ice, and powder = incredible).I was able to pick this up on sale for ~$35, which is one of the best prices for this amount of powder, and this is simply a better protein than the other ones at that price point.
