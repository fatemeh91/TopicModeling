review/text: These Ovulation Test Strips do not come with instructions; however, in the package the company gives the web address where you can find the instructions (obviously if you bought them online you have access to the internet). The directions on their website, Ovulation-Predictor, are simple enough for ANYONE to follow.My own experience with these was excellent. They are just as good as the expensive brands, but at a better price.Highly Recommended!
