review/text: I'm 8 days into this cleanse and the only side effect I've noticed was mild headaches the first 4 or 5 days. The headaches weren't painful enough to even take a pain reliever. I have felt pretty fatigued but I anticipated that. This product has not caused diarrhea which is nice, I was hoping it wouldn't. I chose to do this cleanse because it seemed more complete than other cleanse products out there and it isn't marketed as a weight loss cleanse, which seem to be pretty unhealthy and pointless.
