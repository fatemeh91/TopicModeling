review/text: I am 71 years old. During my younger years, I jogged extensively. When I turned 55, I found that my knees were shot. 10 years ago I was going to have knee replacement. However, after research I thought I would "tough it out". Consequently, I have used various knee braces in the past years.I thought I would try the McDavid Patella Knee Support Black. This decision was based n both price and features.My next order for braces will be a reorder of these. They meet my needs pretty darn well, and better than others tried.
