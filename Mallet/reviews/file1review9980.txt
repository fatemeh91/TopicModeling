review/text: The product works... but its very difficult to get an accurate reading. I already knew my what my body fat percentage was before I got this, I just got it to keep up with it on my own. It took me AT LEAST 15 tries to get around the same reading as a professional one gave me. (by professional, I mean the one we used in my workout class at school. It was used on us by the instructor)
