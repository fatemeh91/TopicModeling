review/text: My boyfriend had two fairly small but stubborn warts, one on each thumb. After continuous application 1-2 times a day (I think a little more than half the stick was used), they're gone! It has been months and they have not come back. Be sure to try to apply it only on the infected area otherwise non-infected skin will feel raw. Cover with bandage if possible.
