review/text: The product of greens you choose to use is your choice as there are many out there. I have tried several others and have my whole family using Green Vibrance. Everyone in the family agrees it makes you feel so much better during the day. At a health food store a salesman advised me that "if I took no other vitamins I should consider a glass of greens a day. Most of the health books I have read support this concept. the list of ingredients and vitamins in Green Vibrance is endless. It seems a little expensive, but then again whats your health worth?
