review/text: This is a very nice looking Tie Clip, it has a very nice "dainty" chain , if you move around a lot you are sure to break it. My husband broke his right as he was trying to put it on. He got it fixed though. He doesn't wear it anymore he is afraid he may break it again. I think if the chain was a little sturdier it would be a great great clip. Now if your just going to sit at a desk and not move around very much it may hold up better, or for the occassional tie wearer. But not for someone who has to get up and down out of a seat and stand all day .Other than that, the tie clip is great!
