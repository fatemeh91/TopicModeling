review/text: My son has had eczema since he was 8 weeks old. we have been trying numerous lotions and finally found a combination that seems to wor. We put this on my son every night after his bath and then put aquaphor on top of it. We have been doing this for a couple of months and it keeps most of the eczema under control.
