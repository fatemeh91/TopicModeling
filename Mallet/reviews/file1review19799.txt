review/text: When we started potty-training our 3 year old boy, we were about ready to pull our hair out in frustration with the tools we had on hand. We had received a generic Cars themed potty seat from a relative, but it would wiggle so much on the toilet that we were too nervous to allow our son to get up on the toilet on his own. This bjorn toilet trainer allows you to adjust it to fit your toilet seat so there is NO wiggle room. We've also liked that it is a simple (non-flashy) design, and the splashgaurd in the front won't hurt/scrape his little parts.Our son has adjusted well to potty training since we switched to this potty seat...what a life-saver.One thing that I have noticed (especially with a boy) is that when I remove the seat to clean the toilet, that there are dribbles on the toilet seat. For me, the safety of the seat far outweighs a few dribbles that can be easily cleaned up, so I'm leaving it with a 5-star rating.
