review/text: i use this in place of meals. i know you have to eat at least 4 meals a day but alot of time i'm not hungry so i drink them, i add at times tumeric or a banana to it and drink it down, but to be fair i have given up 90% white, no starch or pasta, after a few days of this you really don't feel that hungry, doing this for 6 mos but cheating weekly i have lost near 30 lbs and feel good, when u have a craving for something have it but dont pig out on it. I bought another brand in vanilla to switch off, after a while you get bored of chocolat. but doing good dropped from a tight 38 to a loose 34. still using it but once a day because i'm where i want to be,, now just maintenance. i feel it helped me, i still have 2 full cans in closet. i also keep bars in glove compartment not to miss a meal when on the go, hope this helps, this is my story
