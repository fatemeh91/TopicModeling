review/text: I had a cheap $20 Oral-B Vitality before this and it did the same job. The Triumph is a little more powerful, but I'm not sure that justifies the price. I personally don't use any of the additional features that come with the triumph. I don't have sensitive gums so I don't need the soft setting. I don't feel the pulsating power of the massage setting is better for your gums than the normal setting. I don't tend to brush too hard so the changing pitch isn't necessary. And I have a pretty good idea of when I have been brushing long enough without the brush telling me. So I would only recommend the Triumph to people tend to brush too hard since it is the only Oral-B with a pressure sensor and can help prevent a serious problem. Everyone else would probably be happy with a low to mid priced model.After 6 months the only design flaw I have noticed is that the shaft that drives the brush head will rust if you don't dry it off after each use.
