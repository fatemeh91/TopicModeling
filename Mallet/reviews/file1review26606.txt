review/text: This item arrived with no instructions but an impressive list of disclaimers. I inflated it, strapped it in the driver's seat of my car and it felt great. I drove 5 miles to a shopping center for a 15-minute errand, and it was completely deflated when I returned to my car. I reinflated it, and the stopper popped out of the inflation point almost immediately. I've returned it to Amazon for a refund with a suggestion that Amazon dump it and let street vendors handle it from now on.
