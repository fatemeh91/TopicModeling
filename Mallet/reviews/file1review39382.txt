review/text: I read through all the reviews and had my concerns over some of the lesser ratings. There were a few positive reviews that really stood out and so for the price I gave it a try. Following the instructions from another review, I made sure to put it on the right way and I cannot believe how simple it is and how fantastic it works. For all those who complained it was uncomfortable, of course it is a little bit uncomfortable, it is fixing your posture. If it was that uncomfortable, it is most likely because your posture was very poor and your muscles are being challenged by this amazing product. As with anything, I believe that the slight discomfort is worth it, as I know that it will go away as my posture improves. Not to mention that what I am feeling isn't from this product, it is from years of slouching and having terrible posture. This has been a problem I have had all my life, and I feel such an amazing difference having this band on. My shoulders are back, my lower back feels better - and it is so small that it is completely hidden under my t-shirt. Bravo to the creators and I highly recommend this to everyone!!
