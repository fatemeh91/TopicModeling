review/text: Recently got this and it is as good as most of the other reviews make it sound. It gives you a very thick and lubricated shave and you hardly have to use any of the cream to get it to lather up impressively. I used to shave with a lanolin based shaving soap and I would nick myself all the time. I just attributed this to me not being careful but since I've gotten this cream I haven't nicked myself once. Like everyone else mentioned as well, it does smell faintly of lavender so if you are expecting a completely unscented product this is not it.One thing to note is the packaging is slightly different than you see in the image here. Not that it matters to me but the packaging I got was actually just a plastic tub, not a metal top which is what the picture here looks like.I docked it a star since it's pretty expensive.
