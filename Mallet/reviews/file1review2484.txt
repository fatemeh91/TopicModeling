review/text: The drywall screen like callous rasp will smooth hard edges but not sand off deep callouses easily. If you need smoothing this is the ticket. But if you typically shave callouses this may not be enough, or may be step 2 in your routine. The cream is fine, but Cerave lotion (the kind in the tub) or Eucerin works better.
