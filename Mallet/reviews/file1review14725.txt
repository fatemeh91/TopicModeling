review/text: Everyone's body is different. It didn't work for me. In addition, there is no series of reputable research data to show any use of this product for growth harmone production (which I purchased it for). I believe all people that rate this product as successful is the placebo affect (which a high count of people get using most products). They want it to work so they think it does, etc.
