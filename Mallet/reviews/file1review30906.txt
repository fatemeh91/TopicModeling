review/text: ... in your "git along". This Liquid B-12 is a great start. I love the liquid aspect because the vitamin(s) get into ones systems faster and are fully used. Tablets, about half really get used because a body's system can't dissolve them as easily. The rest are expelled from the body. There goes half the money you spent to get your supplements. These days we cannot afford to throw ANY money away, no matter what form. So ... the liquid form of vitamins are the best way to go. No waste!!! This is an AWESOME product, and no needles! I'm not a Dr. but liquid form is a great alternative for the needle, especially when you can't get to your Dr. right away.
