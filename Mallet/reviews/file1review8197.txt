review/text: Trying to clean the build-up out of my wide-mouth Klean Kanteen was a frustrating process, until I found this OXO bottle brush. This brush is fairly inexpensive, and made of high quality materials. It's a must have for any Klean Kanteen owner. On the other hand, you could probably just use a new toilet brush and get the same results.
