review/text: The label on this says "no alcohol, synthetic dyes, artificial flavors or preservatives." Sounds good and natural, right? WRONG! Imagine my surprise when the ingredient list includes polysorbate 80, an emulsifier that has been shown to be hazardous on skin contact, inhalation and ingestion. Further, it's been shown to cause sterility in rats when injected. I was really excited about trying this product, but I cannot recommend it under these circumstances. I'd rather have a brand that you have to shake before using than something that uses chemicals to keep the solution uniform.
