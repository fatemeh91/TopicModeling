review/text: A key to youthful skin is Urea -- very hard to find in products nowadays. This is the real stuff! Many "cosmetics" just out-and-out-LIE, but Urea IS actually excellent for the skin. It does accumulate in the body - perhaps that is why it is not more widely available. With all the other "unknown" @#%* that we consume through the air, skin, mouth, and "other" mucous membranes -- perhaps Urea should be placed way down on the list of "concerns."In addition, Dermal Therapy is reasonably priced!! You just can't beat it -- long term. I'm ordering more! I use this, exclusively, in winter, however, see that my skin is not so youthful this summer. Urea-based products should be used year round! Someone please respond if I am mistaken....
