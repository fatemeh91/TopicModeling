review/text: This stuff is amazing! I played professional sports and always kept a bottle of this in my bag.I don't use stuff that is toxic to my body, only natural products. So, I had my naturopath test it to see if it was a good, pure product (no unnecessary garbage in it) and it rated almost 100% pure. He now uses it in his practice. Easy to use and very effective. I always keep a bottle on hand. Great for aching muscles or joints. Just like the bottle says... non-greasy and fast-acting!
