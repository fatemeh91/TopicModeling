review/text: I have recently gotten into Henna application after many years as a temporary body artist. I was still learning the finer points of mixing my own henna so I thought I might use this until I got the hang of it. I was pleased with the consistency but I put it into my own bottles with proper tips. The tips that came with this product were fairly useless.However...It flaked off quickly even after proper drying and curing. And the stain was not terribly dark nor did it darken over time. ( I was at a conference and could see the developing color) This could have been due to other skin product applications that the ladies did not fess up to. However...I think it was the product.
