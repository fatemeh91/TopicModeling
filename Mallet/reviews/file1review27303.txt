review/text: I'm really happy with this product. I've tried many protein powders and have always been very disappointed. In my experience they usually smell better than they taste. That is definitely not the case with this powder, although it does smell good. It dissolves well with just a little cup with a lid. I shake it for about 1 minute which is longer than when I first got it, before I would shake until it seemed combined but I would have some little clumps in the first sip and lots of bubbles. Then, I found that if I continued shaking for a while longer the clumps were all gone and so were the bubbles. I got the Double Chocolate and it tastes like regular chocolate milk, no weird after taste and no weird smell. Makes me feel great after a good morning run. I haven't tried to blend it with anything yet but there is definitely potential with bananas and/or peanut butter with some yogurt. The only draw backs are that it uses aspartame which you can't taste but I generally try to avoid artificial sweeteners and it is not Organic whey so probably has the growth hormone that I spend $4 on a half gallon on milk to avoid. I was just nervous about the bitter aftertaste complaints about the Optimum Nutrition 100% natural powder, and it didn't look like the flavors were going to be as good. I'll probably try it down the road but for now, I'm really happy with this.
