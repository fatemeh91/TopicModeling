review/text: This is an excellent product if you have soreness on the ball of your foot. I rinse them every other day and where it all the time with all my shoes including my open toe sandals! They are a Godsend!!!!! I have had them now for 6 months and they are still work perfect! I would recommend them. I thought about buying a couple of packages but so far I still have the one package that is working just fine and holding up very well !
