review/text: This is my first bad experience with the Garden of Life product line. It's probably more Amazon.com's fault for a bad description. The ingredient list on Amazon's website does not state that this product contains rice maltodextrin, which is a cheap filler that is used in low quality products. Also, these are not capsules. The website uses the ambiguous term "caplets." This product comes in standard tablet/pill form; it is not in capsules allowing for sprinkling onto food. Caplet is a misleading term. I would not recommend this product or purchase it again.
