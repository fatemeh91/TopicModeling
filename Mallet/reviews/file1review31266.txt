review/text: This was recommended to me and I was looking forward to trying to get some semblance of control over my daughters colds that she would bring home from daycare. I was happy to find this on amazon and ordered it. I wanted to purchase the father johns that did NOT include the dextromethophan(active ingredient). I thoroughly researched the two different types and again was pleases that amazon had that specific product. Unfortunately, it was not amazon who sold it but a third party vendor (OTCRX4U). They sent me the wrong one...the one with the active ingredient (red box not the orange one). :-( I am now having to go through the process of trying to get the to return or exchange it for the product that I ordered. They are claiming that they sent me the right product but if they paid attention to the box rather than the vague amazon description they would realize that they are mistaken. I will NEVER order anything from a third party vendor off amazon again!!!
