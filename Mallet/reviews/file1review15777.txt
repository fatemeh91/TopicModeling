review/text: I am an engineer and do alot of documentation review. Black ink, red ink, and pencil, in one nice looking and comfortable to hold package. Love it. Pencil is comfortable to use also.If I have one complaint it is that the ink can get a little gloppy on the tip. But I do not know if that is just an isolated cartridge issue or if the refills will be like that. Only reason it didn't get 5 stars. Overall I would recommend.
