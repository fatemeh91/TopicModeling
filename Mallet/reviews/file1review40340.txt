review/text: Have had this product for a while and finally had an opportunity to "test" it. On a recent international flight I had the pleasure of being trapped on a plane with several obviously ill people (coughing, sneezing, etc.). Going through the lengthy customs procedure allowed me to be bathed with even more nastiness as the number of sick people increased exponentially.Within 24 hours of arriving home I had the first symptoms of illness...sore throat, headache, stuffy nose. Remembered that I had these in medicine cabinet and started taking as directed. I am a skeptic by nature, but am also open to new things.I honestly didn't think anything would improve as I've had less than stellar results with "Airborne" and Tamiflu both.I am very pleased to say that I never got worse and was never "down for the count." I truly believe this product did the trick and kept me from going into a full blown cold/flu.The only thing I would list as a "con" on this product is that it seems a bit pricey as you will use the entire box (at a minimum) per illness. On the other hand, this is a reasonable price to pay to avoid getting sick, buying any kind of OTC relief, losing time for work, play, living, etc.Bottom line: it worked, and I've purchased a bigger bottle to keep on hand.
