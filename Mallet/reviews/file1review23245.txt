review/text: This sweeper works well for me on area rugs and hardwood floors alike. It picks up a variety of messes, from dirt to cat hair to toddler snacks to bits of paper. It is easy to empty the dual trays, and it holds a fair amount of dirt in the trays. However, it doesn't work as well on super shaggy rugs, which really isn't surprising--it's hard to get anything out of really long pile. My son has a novelty rug with extra long pile; he has to shake it out and then use the sweeper on the wood floor to pick up the dirt. I don't think there is a lot that can be done to improve that, though, since even vacuums have trouble with rugs of that sort.My biggest problem with the sweeper is the handle. It simply will not stay together. It ships in sections that you then push together. But no matter how hard I shove the sections together, they eventually fall apart--often when carrying it to be emptied, dumping dirt all over the floor. If it were threaded, I think it would hold together much better than just popping the sections into place. I would definitely like to see that improvement. Other than the handle falling apart at inconvenient times, it works well. I would buy it again (maybe along with a tube of super glue!).
