review/text: For some reason I was led to believe this vitamin A & D combo came from fish oil. It didn't. Kind of weird. Anyway, it's retinyl palmitate and lanolin-derived vitamin D. For what it is, it's good. It's not what I was expecting, but it seems to work. The moons on my fingernails are growing back--that's about all I notice from it, but if it's doing that, it's probably doing other things, too.
