review/text: Our 7 year old son continues to soak his bed 3 to 4 times a week, did I mention this is through a good night pull-up? I got very tired of stripping his bed and doing all of the bedding. I tried this pad and was sold the first night. Since my son must roll around in the night, I put it across his bed so it stays in place. It really did change my life and I will buy more for the bunk beds in our cabin.
