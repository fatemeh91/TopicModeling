review/text: Recently had foot surgery that left my feet dry and flaky. My cousin had the same sugery a few months earlier and purchased this cream at the podiatrist office and highly recommended. I found it at Amazon for a fourth of the price she paid, so I purchased 2 for her and 2 for myself at about the same price she paid for one jar. The cream is great and does the job compared to other procuts I was using including vaseline which is greasy.
