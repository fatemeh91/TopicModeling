review/text: I can't even pretend to be a serious survivalist type like some reviewers. I'm a suburban stay-at-home-mom with an interest in preparedness because it is part of my duty to care for my family.I bought my Adventure Medical Kits Pocket Survival Pack in November 2009 and also gave them to several family members that holiday season. I've had mine in my purse at all times since, except when flying as I don't want to risk having it confiscated so I put in checked luggage or mail it ahead with my pocket knife. (I also carry a flashlight and first aid kit at all times.)Last weekend, while on a hike and picnic for my son's class at a local conservation area, it was grey and rainy and colder than expected. We discovered a fire pit when we got to the picnic site, and everyone was saying how great it would be to light a fire if only we'd planned ahead and brought matches. Someone was talking about hiking back to the cars if anyone carried matches when I remembered my little survival pack. Lo and behold, we were able to get a fire started on a damp day using scavenged downfall wood with just one bundle of Tinder Quick Firestarter and the Spark-Lite Fire Starter.Every item fits neatly in the kit and they will go back in if you unpack it to inspect the contents. I'm very pleased with the quality of the included items and the form factor is absolutely phenomenal. Seeing the kit proven useful in the field makes it even better.
