review/text: Ditto everything Genevieve (Most helpful favorable review) says. TIP: If you are currently taking Prilosec or Nexium, continue taking it during the 20 day course of the Heartburn Free regimen. THEN quit the Prilosec or whatever acid reducer you have been taking. Otherwise, you may think that the Heartburn Free isn't working. Be sure to complete the full 10 capsule (take every other day) regimen. I keep a second box on hand for rare breakthrough heartburn.Still unsure? Reducing or shutting down stomach acid production (like Prilosec & Nexium does) may intuitively seem like a good solution to heartburn or GERD. Problem is, you need stomach acid to break down & then absorb nutrients from food or vitamins... Please Google: Effects of vitamin and mineral deficiencies (particularly B vitamins), and you will discover the health costs of using Prilosec, Nexium..., which will worsen with time. Switch to Heartburn Free & start taking a good FOOD-BASED multivitamin/ mineral supplement to make-up for deficiencies that you may already have. If you have stomach problems after taking vitamins, that will go away or be reduced as well. I like "Alive" brand vit./mins., but any health food store can make a good Food-based vit. recommendation.I had expected to be on 1st Prilosec, then Nexium for the rest of my life. Bless the Whole Foods Market employee in the supplement section who told me abt Heartburn Free when it first came out. I have used it with excellent results ever since.Amazon has the best $ I have found, & the free shipping helps when you order 2 packs.
