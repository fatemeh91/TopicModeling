review/text: This item is great especially if you are a hairy monkey like myself. This product is able to pull out my dark, coarse hair without a hitch. The first use definitely hurts but the pain lessens with each use. The only negative is that I seem to have more ingrown hairs than I did w/ shaving. I'm also still a tad nervous to use it on my armpits. Overall, a really great product that I wish I had purchased sooner.
