review/text: I've never had a wart before and I guess I just got lucky when I bought this wart stick because one, it was the cheapest wart product I've seen and two, it actually worked! I've read other reviews before buying it so I didn't bother reading the instructions. Just cut a glob of the wart stick off, put it on tape or a bandage, stick it to yourself, replace it daily and scrape off the dead skin while in the shower. Mine flattened out within two weeks. Doesn't look gross or contagious. But I'm not a wart expert. Will it come back? I don't know but if it does I have 95% of my wart stick left to go around.
