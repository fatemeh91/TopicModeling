review/text: I ordered this product and eagerly awaited the onset of sickness to see if it was effective. Normally, I do not get sick very often, so I thought it might be a while. Surprisingly, I felt the "onset" of sickness within a week or two of the product arriving. I normally take vitamin D3 to boost my immune system. I eat a healthy, mostly vegan (totally vegetarian) diet with very little refined carbs or processed food. I also tan to get more D3.Well, this product did not help me avoid getting sick. My ex-wife and daughter were ill and through exposure to them, I thought I might get ill. I normally am able to avoid their bugs or at least delay succumbing to them, and I normally recover much earlier. In this case, I took this product, and I did delay onset, but when I got it, I got it bad. I had bronchitis and I couldn't shake the resulting cough for more than a month. Perhaps the product helped; perhaps it didn't. But it definitely did not help me avoid sickness, and with just the one experience, I'm forced to give it a negative review.
