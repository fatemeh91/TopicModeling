review/text: I have tried several multivitamins and now for the last two years it is the only one I buy. While no I am not pregnant I have issues with leg cramps and this was a recommendation from my doctor. I love it and recommend to anyone who asks-and even those who don't. Amazon has the best price out there by far and it is true you get what you pay for.
