review/text: I love this stuff! 4 oz is a nice size but any size works. It is good for all kinds of stuff. Think of it as something you can spray on sheets when you stay in a hotel or something you can spray on yourself for a bug bite (skeeters), or for a rash (heat rash). You might smell like a pizza, so put it on at bedtime.I like the 4 oz size, but the bottle size really does not matter.Natural, edible, multipurpose pump spray with a bahzillion uses:Vegetable washAir cleanerHand cleanerToothbrush sprayFood cleanerEnvironmental spray odor neutralizerKitchen & bathroom cleanerPet deodorizerInsect repellantBody or foot deodorantSkin toner (???--maybe because of the oil and lavender)Nursery spray (strong scent but natural--instead of chemical)Public disinfectant (those toilet seats!)Breath freshener (only if you kiss a pizza lover)Ingredients are oil of wild oregano, oil of lavender, oil of wild bay leaf, oil of clove and you can smell it right through the bottle--so it is a real good strength.BTW, the product does not feel oily.It was recommended to me when all the swine flu stuff started by an herbalist friend as a "critter" deterrent and also as a disinfectant. I spray the sheets and the toilet seats in hotels when traveling. I also spray on my skin for a skin irritation or rash. You will likely feel a slight burning sensation when using on your skin, which I believe is the antiseptic properties killing germs.Note #1 -- the bottle says keep away from eyes and genitals, which I would think to be a "no brainer," but, people amaze me all the time.Note #2 - if I am planning to spray it on my skin, I generally do that before bed. Otherwise, someone may think I am cooking pizza.Believe me, I would prefer a natural product over a chemical anytime.BTW--You can also get drops (dropper bottle) to take orally under the tongue. Seems to work well to kill cold/flu germs but is strong. The first time will likely be a little shock. (Yeah. You too, tough guy.) You could mix with water if you need to or squirt on food, or at least have a glass of water ready and maybe put something in your stomach first.
