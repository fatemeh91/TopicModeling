review/text: I used the generic CVS brand the first time with absolutely no problems. Purchased Dulcolax and had the same intense pain as earlier reviewers. I thought I was going to faint the first time and had cold sweats. I attributed the pain to possibility of food poisoning as we had been out for dinner that evening. Took the pill a second time and pain not as intense but severe cramps. Definitely not a mild laxative. I tried one more time, took it last night, had same severe cramps at 3 in the morning and still have "runs" to the bathroom and it is 11 am.Everyone is different and I believe the reviewer that recommended taking it early in the day as a trial has a valid point. It is an effective laxative for some but for others it is to be avoided.
