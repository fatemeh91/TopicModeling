review/text: I really enjoy these. It is something I can chew on a bit and get a nice flavor from. They help with bad breath and are an okay substitute for snacking. These have a very strong flavor. I'd go so far as to say they burn a bit. Do not mistake them for something like a mint toothpick as they are way more strong. They are shaped exactly like a fancy toothpick with one pointed side and one fancy side. You do generally want to chew on them as you will get more flavor from them that way.
