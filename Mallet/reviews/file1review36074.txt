review/text: So this l-arginine by now foods is amazing for its price and quantity but I am sure all of you have had problems with the taste. I searched up on the internet and found out from a site someone stating how to make the taste bearable, even in just plain water. The reason is because the arginine does not dissolve well in one single mix. You must stir and then let it settle to the bottom and then stir again and settle about 3 to 4 or more times depending on how many scoops. You will notice that after each stir and settling there is progressively less arginine powder settling to the bottom and the mixture will go from cloudy to clear no matter what cold drink you choose to use. I have just tried it with one scoop of water and stirred and let it settle 4 times until it was completely clear and it was bearable to even sip let alone gulp. So guys try that and see what you think.
