review/text: I bought this wax and was so excited to use it last night. I am sick of shaving and for winter time, waxing seems ideal. It was horribly painful, pulling skin more than anything else. And to top it off, it removed some hair but broke off others so I wound up feeling like I hadn't shaved on a couple of days because I am covered with stubble!! It did remove about 3/4 of the hair, which is the only reason I'm giving it 2 stars. But the 1/4 it left behind, it simply broke off leaving a whisker feel. Not happy and will not buy again! The scent is pleasant and clean up is easy. That's all I can say about it. *sigh* Pain for nothing.
