review/text: I searched and searched for a "meal replacement shake" in a large jug - NOT the individual packages this comes in. I gave up and bought this. I am very pleased. It tastes good, and fills you up. It gets 4 stars for two reasons: I can't find it in a jug, and it can be difficult to mix. Clumps will form on the side and top of my shaker and they just will not mix unless you knock them loose. If you use a shaker with the round metal spring thing inside of it, I think this will defeat the clumps. I've also ended up traveling a lot so having individual packets has turned out to be very handy. I'm buying one of the small mixer/blenders now. This is not "protein powder." When you mix this up it "fluffs up" and is thick and rich like a chocolate malt. It was a lot more substantial than I anticipated. I use cold water, but I imagine using cold milk would make this even better. When I run out, I will buy this again.
