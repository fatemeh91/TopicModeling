review/text: I ordered this a few months ago. I suffer from tension/stress along my left shoulder blade. It causes extreme pain throughout my left shoulder area and radiates up my neck and into my frontal chest. I've tried various devices and even a neck pillow to get relief. Nothing worked until I got the BBB. It took about 1.5 - 2 weeks of daily (several times a day) use, but now I'm completely pain free. Now, when I start to feel the least bit of tightness or twinging, out comes the BBB to the rescue. This thing is platinum to me. I'd give it 10 stars if I could.
