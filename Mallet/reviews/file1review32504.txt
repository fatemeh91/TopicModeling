review/text: The table itself is everything it advertised; pretty, sturdy, comfortable and the heater works fine. I would have loved this product if I didn't hate the headrest and armrest so much. The headpiece was flimsy, hard to adjust, and worst of all, can't breath through that tiny opening. Armrest, totally useless.
