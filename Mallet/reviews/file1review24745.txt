review/text: Item was as specified, reasonable price, reasonable shipping, prompt communication, and adequate item description. Socks did exactly what it's suppose to do, however, I would recommend you get the ones that go above the knee due to impediment of circulation at the knee which can possibly result in skin lesions.
