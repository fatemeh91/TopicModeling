review/text: I've been using EAS 100% Whey Protein 5 LBS Chocolate - Value Packs - Resealable Packaging for quite some time and was very happy with it -- I love the chocolate taste (even with water) and it mixes well. After reading the reviews here on Amazon though, I thought I'd give "Gold Standard from Optimum Nutrition" a try... however it tastes like a cheap artificial hot chocolate mix. I must recommend EAS first, but this brand is doable and mixes well, however my next order will be a bag from EAS!
