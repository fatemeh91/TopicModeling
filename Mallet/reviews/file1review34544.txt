review/text: Ok. I've used this for several years now. In our previous house, we were on a lake with a constant breeze. It wasn't a wooded area, and the mosquito population wasn't too problematic. I'm in South Louisiana, which is definitely mosquito country, but we didn't have a bunch at that house. Having said that, this product always did the job there. We recently moved to a house that is surrounded by trees and wooded areas. This product does very little for high mosquito areas. I've had to resort to the 5% DEET for my kids. I've tried ALL of the non-toxic options, and they just don't cut it. If you are up north or in a light mosquito area, this should work fine in my experience. Otherwise, keep searching.
