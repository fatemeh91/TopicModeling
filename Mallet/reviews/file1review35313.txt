review/text: I need to pay attention to the fine print and reviews. I, too, am a teacher, and did not realize I was ordering just ONE tuning fork, when the image clearly shows a boxed set. I am not even sure what "512 cps weighted" means. I hope I can use this tuning fork for its intendend purpose. I wish the company would have been more clear with its advertising and description.
