review/text: This is really a fun item. It's saucy & cute, and even practical. The graphics & colors are very well done. The fabric is a thick rubbery type plastic, with a good quality zipper. Even the zipper tab has a funny saying on it. It's got lots more graphics on the inside. It's going in a gift bag & can't wait to see the look on my friend's face when she opens it. It will illicit laughter for sure.The case is very well made & will hold a plenty of tampons. It's not thick, so they'd be in single file. Very glad I bought it - it's unique & something she will pull out to show her other girlfriends....look what I got !
