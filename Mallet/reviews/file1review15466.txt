review/text: This theraputty is great for hand therapy and the progressive resistances makes it even better. Highly recommended if you have any type of hand or wrist injury, but be careful and don't let it come in contact with anything except your hands or the containers as it will attach itself to everything and is a bear to get off. It was delivered promptly.
