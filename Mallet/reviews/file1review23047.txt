review/text: believe it or not, I bought this for my son! He's three and totally obsessed with vacuum cleaners and things that pick up trash. Now I can run my vacuum cleaner without having to fight him for it- he has his own so he can be handy around the house! The handle is adjustable, which is great but it's true it DOES tend to come apart (though ours not as much as some reviews I've read).
