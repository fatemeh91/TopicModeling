review/text: I love this eye glass cleaners. I've used them for years. I used to buy them in big boxes from costco, but then costco started selling a different brand of premoistened glass wipes that don't even compare to the quality of these Bausch and Lomb ones.These are by far the best premoisted eye glass cleaning wipes I have found. I take them everywhere. I have little stashes at home at work and in my car!
