review/text: I have never owned an electric toothbrush but after being encouraged by the dentist for years, I decided to break down and get one. My teeth have never felt cleaner and it has helped me to brush longer. It took a few days to get use to the brush but after that, easy. The brush is easy to use and the timer is great. My only complaint is the light on the charger is quite bright so you need to shut the bathroom door, especially when it is in the blinking mode and charging. Other than that, a great product. We'll see what the dentist thinks at the next visit! New smile!
