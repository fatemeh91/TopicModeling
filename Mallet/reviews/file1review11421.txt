review/text: I grind my teeth when I sleep, pretty severely. I've had a variety of night guards, from the 400 dollar custom made to the cheap-o sports guards. I keep coming back to this one. Its not ideal -- the front strap in front of the bottom teeth doesn't adjust enough, for instance. But it does stand up to my grinding, and there's very little adjusting to make it fit for me. And when I grind through it, it's not such a big deal, since these are relatively inexpensive.
