review/text: My masseuse recommended the Rainbow Light brand for any supplement. I'm not pregnant but I was still in search of something with a good dose of Iron and B vitamins, that would not upset my stomach! This is by far the best multivitamin for that. It must be the ginger they add. I've been taking it every morning with breakfast for the past several months and feel like I have more energy. I will continue to take this and highly recommend it to women with sensitive stomachs, pregnant or not!
