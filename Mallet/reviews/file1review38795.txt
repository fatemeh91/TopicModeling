review/text: Received product mere days after ordering. Bought when canned product was recalled, and now I like the powdered form better. It has a better flavor than the canned, I think it's because it doesn't have that metallic aftertaste. Does not spoon-mix really well, but it mixes perfectly in a shaker glass with a lid.
