review/text: This product works great, and I feel better about removing some of the toxic junk from our home with a small child.I sure wish that Amazon would hurry up and get this product and the lavender fabric softener back in stock. We have been waiting patiently with no updates. Many of these Seventh Generation laundry items are not currently in stock. What's going on Amazon? It's been a while now..Our liquid laundry detergent and fabric softener arrived very quickly with no problems with the bottles (no leaking) -- even in the Florida sun.Thanks!
