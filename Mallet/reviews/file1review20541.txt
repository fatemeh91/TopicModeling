review/text: I have always used Glade floss in the past but after the company was sold to P&G it seemed as though the formula changed because it now breaks easily. In my search for another floss I have read other reviews about Tom's floss and the only negative comments I found had to do with the floss being "thick" and difficult to use for people whose teeth are close together with little space between the teeth. I have that problem but thought I'd try the floss because it is sold in our local health food store. I think the floss is great and would be a perfect choice for most people. It is quite "thick" though and I do have some trouble using it and it tends to shred a little in tight spaces but it doesn't break and does a great job otherwise. It's a perfect choice for most people but those with tight spacing should give it try with the knowledge that it might not work for you.
