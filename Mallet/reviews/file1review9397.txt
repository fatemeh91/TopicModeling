review/text: The Apex Pocket Med Pack Pill Dispenser/Tray is one of the better products on the market. Overall, I give it five stars. However, there are some positive and negative features to point out.Positives:-Excellent organization that allows for removal of days dispensed-"Standing" tray has a somewhat space-saving design (see negatives as well)-Individual, removable day trays allow for an easy way to take on trips. Just take the days you need (a weekend, for instance) instead of everything.-Secure AM/PM compartment. No way pills will move from the AM/PM slots.-Secure latch...even if the trays are dropped, the pills stay putNegatives:-While the ability to remove a day tray for travel or organization is a great feature, it also makes for a negative. The trays can be easily knocked over if sitting on a table or vanity.-Size: the features listed above come at a price of space. While the compartments are standing and save some space, this product is larger than its competition.Overall, this product is highly recommended for anyone!
