review/text: I originally bought the Coccyx Cushion because the price was much cheaper than the Tush Cush; however, I had to return the Coccyx Cushion because it had a horrible smell.There is no doubt that the Tush Cush is a good product and does its job to alleviate my tailbone pain; however, I feel like I am being ripped off by having to pay $50 for a piece of foam.
