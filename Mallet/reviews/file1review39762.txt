review/text: Please be aware that this product is also sold at thebeddesk.com and there is an unwritten "no return no refund" policy. I purchased a bed desk for my father, who unfortunately passed away before it was received. Mr David Drake, the inventor and president of the company refuses to refund my money despite my having returned the desk untouched in it's original packaging. Buy at your own risk unless you can afford to lose the $50+ cost of the product.
