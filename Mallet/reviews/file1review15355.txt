review/text: I don't smoke, so I do not use this as an ashtray.Instead I use it to carry various medicinal pills in my pocket... and have been carrying it for several months now.Works great... IF you add some cotton to the end near the opening so you can get the pills out easily.The problem with this is trying to easily identify the top so the contents don't spill out when you open it should you hold it horizontally... so I marked the horizontal top with bright orange nail polish.I usually keep this along with a small pen, pocket knife, and lip balm in a small zippered leather case that fits easily in my pocket.
