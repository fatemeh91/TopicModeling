review/text: Comparing this pad to an ordinary drugstore pad is like comparing a rowboat to a battleship. I became aware of this product by visiting a friend who said to me "you are walking as if you are really in pain". I acknowledged that I was and he said "try this". Within 15 minutes I was searching for one for me on my phone internet browser while I was still using has pad...if you like a deep heat on your sore shoulders, don't even hesitate.You will notice that the information says it has a "trigger" switch you have to hold down to have the unit on. Trust me, within 3 minutes you will understand and appreciate that switch.Simply, it's more money, but it is worth it.
