review/text: I love this thing. Yes, it hurts a little bit, but you get used to it. And it's MUCH easier than waxing. I used to actually tweeze my legs (it took forever!) and I'm pretty particular about hair removal. I have to say, this thing is more thorough than me with a pair of tweezers. I thought I would still have to do a follow-up tweeze afterwards but I am thrilled to report that I do not. It gets EVERYTHING. Yes, you do have to go over each spot more than once -- and it's probably a 30-minute or so process for both legs -- but it's well worth it. I also really like that you just plug it in and you're ready to go. There's no need to worry about charging or changing batteries.
