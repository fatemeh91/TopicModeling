review/text: Well worth the money! Since the glass ball is not attatched to the base, needs SOME care in handling, but nothing abnormal. Very good quality glass ball, not cheap or easily breakable - can be used alone as paperweight. Use of glass rather than cheap plastic ball makes for a much better quality light show and more sophisticated ambience. Sound quality is very good when fresh batteries installed.GREAT array of color effects, makes good nightlight, relaxer or party light. Very good in place of candles if in dorm.
