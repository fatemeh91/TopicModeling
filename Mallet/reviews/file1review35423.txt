review/text: Our dishwasher is several years old, and in pulling a "stray" spoon out of the bottom I realized it had a significant amount of film. In addition, the bottom rack rolled out like it was driving down a rocky road - bumping up and down the whole way. I bought Dishwasher Magic to clear up the film, but now the bottom rack glides like it is new - must have been some buildup on the rollers as well. The inside is sparkling clean as well. I had not necessarily noticed reduced performance of the dishwasher, but hoping this spiked the performance as well. But either way, it did what I purchased it for and more. Will make part of my regular maintenance.
