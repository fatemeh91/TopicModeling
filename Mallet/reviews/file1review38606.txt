review/text: I bought this for my dad. He really liked it. He said that he feels liked it did work. He would complain about pains in his arm but once he put it on he felt the pain deminish. So he truly has faith in the bracelet, so maybe its mind over matter or strong belief but hey if it worked for him thats all that matters. Plus I think that it looks nice, its very elegant and its worth the price. I would recommend it.
