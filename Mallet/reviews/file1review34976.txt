review/text: I tried the Prilosec, etc. drugs, but digestive enzymes and this DGL Ultra seem to be much more effective for me long term. In particular, I find that NOT eating at night before bedtime is a continuing hardship for me. But sometimes, just popping two of these in my mouth gets me past that urge and through a good night. I find them tasty enough to continue to use them.
