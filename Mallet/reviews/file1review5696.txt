review/text: This is an amazing toy, it does wonders! I've been using this type for over a year and I have to say that I am very happy with the performance. The only problem that I have is that it only seems to last 3-6 months for me as well. I don't think I over used them. And I'm very happy that the price is so low here on amazon! I really do think its worth it even if I do have to buy two a year, it'll only be 20 dollars a year for the best toy ever! Give it a shot, I promise you won't regret it!
