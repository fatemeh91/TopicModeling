review/text: This is my 2nd Panasonic model. (I dropped the last one after 2 years, and it broke.) This new version is identical except that they've added a plastic thingy in the middle, to prevent hairs from catching/pulling. While this is a nice gesture, it means you have to really work harder to get some trimming done! Multiple passes and odd angling are now the norm, and I'm disappointed. This new version is quieter.
