review/text: I've used brushes before where the whole head vibrates - I get toothpaste all over the bathroom, not to mention my face. This one has a standard brush at the bottom, the spinning head at the top, so you actively brush your teeth AND have the spin head action. My teeth are very crooked, and this gets in between in all the awkward spaces and leaves my teeth feeling like I've been to the hygienist. I also like having regular batteries rather than a rechargable base - I can take it in my suitcase or camping, and it doesn't weigh a ton. Quieter, too. Still is messier than a regular toothbrush, though.
