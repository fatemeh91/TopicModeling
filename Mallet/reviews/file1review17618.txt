review/text: I have owned this trimmer for almost a year, using it about once a week, and have only had to plug it in to recharge once. So the battery life, one of the most important things in a cordless trimmer, is excellent thus far. As far as the trim, I haven't felt it tug or pull whiskers one time, and it has a wide range of lengths, from stubble to quite long for a trimmed beard. Additionally, it is easy to clean (the head pivots open to empty any hairs caught inside) and reliable. Highly recommended!
