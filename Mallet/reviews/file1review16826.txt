review/text: This review is for the Black Cherry Almond flavor only. Amazon has mixed the reviews for the different flavors, which is unfortunate as they are not all the same. I purchased this flavor after reading the other reviews. I prefer this flavor compared to the Cranberry Apple Cherry flavor which I also tried (and found to taste somewhat sweeter than I prefer). This is a good choice as a breakfast bar if you are in a hurry, and can also be taken along in travel bags or back packs. This flavor (no chocolate) ships well in heat and can be carried in heat. The energy to weight ratio, durability, and long shelf life (expiration date was 8 months from the date of delivery) makes it a good choice for backpacking, mountain climbing, etc., or as an emergency food in a disaster area.
