review/text: I've searched high and low for a deet-free bug spray for my 4-year-old. He and I both get eaten alive by bugs. This is the only deet-free spray that my son will tolerate. The smell is mild and pleasant - unlike some other deet-free sprays, which my son absolutely refuses to use! It is also very effective. When we use the spray, neither of us gets bitten (even when we're hiking and camping). If we forget the spray, however, we come home covered in bites from head to toe. If you're in the market for a deet-free bug spray, I would highly recommend this. We won't use anything else!
