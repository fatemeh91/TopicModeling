review/text: Product was as described. However, the box is marked all over "Not for retail sale" and it makes me wonder why. When I initially got my glucose monitor, it came with a box of test strips marked the same way. Is someone selling the meters and the test strips that are supposed to come with them seperately to gain a profit? Highly unethical if that's the case.
