review/text: I have been using this razor (on my LEGS not face lol) for quite a few years now and it is the best! I prefer Men's razors to Women's because they give you a closer shave (though you do have to be a little more careful ouch!) and legs stay smooth longer. I will be subscribing for this item and I will be trying the shower spray tip that reviewer "Jonathan Sabin" wrote in a previous review. I hate the cost but it IS worth it! (tip for the girls, with some hair remover soap and/ or lotion makes very smooth legs for longer!)
