review/text: I am on a low carb diet 45 years old, and don't have energy in the evenings to work out (due to lack of carbs and age?), and it was getting me down. I would get on the treadmill, and could barely do 20-25 minutes.I didn't want to start eating more carbs just to work out, but just in time, my friend recommended this product, and it has changed my life! First of all, only take 25% of the bottle, there are 4 servings this way. When I took half the bottle, my blood sugar dropped and it made me shaky. The quarter dose gave me a boost, and I felt great, got through a 45 minute treadmill workout, and felt like I was 25 again. One downside, is that you may not get to sleep right away, I usually take this product around 3:30 pm, and can fall asleep by 10:30 pm. You will be amazed at how good it makes you feel, and the grape tastes great- just like a diet beverage. Hope they don't take it off the market anytime soon, because I think it is too good to be true.
