review/text: After reading a lot of product descriptions, customer reviews, and countless on-line resources about different types of protein powders - I decided to give this product a try. I ordered the 2 pound Extreme Milk Chocolate, thinking if I didn't like it I wouldn't have wasted too much money. I've been using the product for a week and a half, and so far my only complaint is the after taste. Please note I said the aftertaste, and not the taste as you drink it. I knew before buying it that it has artificial sweeteners, so I expected the after taste.I bought this product for recovery after I work out. I always drink it with low fat milk, and sometimes I blend it with some ice - it tastes great and mixes well with a few shakes or turn of the spoon. If you're a chocolate lover I suggest you get the extreme milk chocolate flavor. When this is finished I'll probably try another flavor, maybe banana cream.Since I got it for $25.99 with free shipping, it was worth it. It's a great boost after working out, and great as a meal on the go on a busy day or pre-workout since it's light enough to drink then head straight into the pool.
