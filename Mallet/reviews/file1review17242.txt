review/text: I haven't had this thing for very long, about 1.5 years. I only use it once every couple of weeks to trim my beard. It will not hold a charge anymore. I have to plug it in every time I want to trim and let it charge for a couple hours beforehand, because as other reviewers have noted: it won't operate on A/C power. So if the battery goes, the whole thing is worthless even when plugged in.To its credit, it trims pretty well. But once the battery goes, it's a paperweight. Buy something else.
