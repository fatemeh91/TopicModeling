review/text: A friend recommended this to me, but how are you supposed to know what size to order? There's no information given to explain the letter sizes. What, do I just order a "D" because it's my lucky letter or something? No help on any of the product's non-Amazon sites about what the letters mean either. I may come back and revise my review based on product performance, but right now the lack of info about sizes is just making me angry.
