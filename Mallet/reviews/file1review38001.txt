review/text: I am an EMT-B in California and have used similar devices and was trained on a Philips AED. AEDs and especially this unit are very easy to use but during an emergency the panic of the situation can cloud your thoughts so read the directions before you need to.I have some advice for anyone buying an AED or considering it:AEDs are a wonderful invention, but don't forget about CPR. I recommend taking a class on CPR. Not administering CPR immediately reduces the effectiveness of defibrillators and chances of survival.Though an AED can save someone's life, the doctors in the Emergency Room can make the difference so calling 911 is essential. If you are alone call 911 right when someone `goes down,' even before applying the AED or starting CPR.*disclaimer: talk to your physician. I am in no way licensed to provide medical advice or practice medicine.ALWAYS CALL 9 1 1 IN AN EMERGENCY.
