review/text: This is the most awesome product ever! I used to have regular periods till I hit my late 20's, then my system started going crazy. I'd miss a period then get one the following month. Then I went for 3 months without...hence a trip to the dr and left with a prescription for Provera. I started researching Provera and only found bad stuff about it being synthetic... my search lead me to Vitex, and since its natural, I thought it's worth a try. I took one pill a day and the following month my period was right on schedule...and each month since!! I think it works wonderfully.Before writing this review, I read the others and noticed one lady writing about the decreased migraines. I used to suffer from migraines at least once a week, and they were bad & horrible. Bad enough to make a trip to the ER sometimes, as I was sure something much more was wrong...they were that intense! I noticed in the last past few months that I've had less migraines and they were less intense, some that I could skip taking a pill. Upon reading the other ladies reviews, I'm now confident it was Vitex regularing out the hormones that were causing the migraines. I too found that I'm less irritable and moody.I want to call Vitex the magic "lady fix".
