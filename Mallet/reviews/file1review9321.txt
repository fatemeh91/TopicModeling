review/text: These things are very convientent. I am constantly forgeting to take my vitamins and these are great becuase they fit in my purse, don't accidentally open, and are a constant reminder to take my vitamins. The only downside is they tend to tip over when I'm filling them, so I have to prop teh lid open with something, but it's not a big deal. Very secure and I love that they are colorful and don't make me feel self-concious about the amount of vitamins and pills I have to take.
