review/text: I will make my comments very short and crisp as there are very good reviews listed under this product category. I would say this product is somewhat in-between very expensive and very cheap, useless protein products. If you are a jogger, play tennis, spend time in Cardio and spend time in muscle toning then this is for you. If you want to get monster muscle then look for another product."Understand" what you want from your body. This does a good job in keeping your energy level high and overall you have a feel good factor. Hope this helps.
