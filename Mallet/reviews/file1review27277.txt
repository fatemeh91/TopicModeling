review/text: You might think this protein is expensive, but know this: a serving size for 26g is "one heaping scoop." I've had cheaper protein but the serving was two scoops. So this isn't really as expensive on a per gram basis. Plus, it disolves easily and doesn't clump up like some cheaper ones do and it tastes as good as can be expected. (I suggest a little bit of cinnamon to sweeten it up.) And I like that it doesn't come in a big, half-empty, hard plastic drum. If you pour some into a tupperware container you can stash the big zip-lock bag somewhere out of the way.
