review/text: I have tried lot of whey flavors of various brands but Cookies N' Cream stands out among all. I read lot of good reviews about double rich chocolate also, so I ordered it first. It certainly wasn't bad, esp. for a protein powder but cookies n' cream is amazingly good tasting. I don't know how many other protein powders can I take with just cold water. Just put it in a shaker and it dissolves easily even in cold water and tastes even better with a dash of orange juice...I know this concoction sounds little weird but I like it! I don't get any bloated feeling afterwards like I used to get with GNC whey. In nutshell, this product is a winner...try it once and you might not opt for anything else later.
