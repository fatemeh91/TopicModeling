review/text: I can't believe that this product is no longer available. My wife and I have used it for decades, and now nobody is carrying it? It specifically targets throat discomfort from sore throat to cough. It has a very pleasant lemon flavor with a spicy Echinacea bite. Quite refreshing and a very functional product.I hope they bring it back!
