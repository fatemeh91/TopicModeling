review/text: I bought this to pull cactus needles out of my body in case I should take a digger while riding my mountain bike. Fortunately, no need for that yet, but I did ride through a cactus patch and had to extract tons of small needles from my tire. These worked great for doing that small detailed grabbing. Really happy so far. Hopefully I'll never need them to remove cactus needles from my person...
