review/text: I didn't like this product at all. I read reviews complaining about the bad smell, but I had so much pain that I said how bad could it be? Boy I was wrong, It smells like hell.i couldn't be around people, and worse of all the relief lasted for a few minutes for me it wasn't worth it. I ended up using preparation H suppositories and the wipes. that gave me relief fast. But the best for me are the fargelin tabletsHigh Strength Fargelin 36 Tablets,Preparation H Medicated Hemorrhoidal Wipes with Witch Hazel and Aloe, 48-Count Refill Packages (Pack of 4),Preparation H Hemorrhoidal Suppositories (48 count)
