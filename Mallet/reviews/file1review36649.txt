review/text: Irish Spring Deodorant Bath Bar is my favorite soap. I love the way it makes me feel! It's a very refreshing experience. The clean, fragrant scent helps me open my eyes in the morning, and get a good start on my day! Irish Spring really works well! I smell clean and feel refreshed all day long! I'd recommend this product to everyone I know!
