review/text: I got this vac because the Merry Maids who clean my house on occasion use this vacuum. They recommended it. When I got it, I used it for the first time and ended up with a stiff neck and an aching shoulder. The second time, the latch had broken off the back and I had to rig up a way to keep the dust container closed. And then there was another couple of days of aches and pains. I guess the people who rave about this vac are a lot younger or stronger than I am, but I am giving mine away. I would recommend staying away from this machine.
