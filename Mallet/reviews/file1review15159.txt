review/text: I love these bars. I don't like nuts, so this is my favorite flavor. Unlike a lot of nutrition bars, it doesn't make your jaw ache trying to chew it down. It's small but filling, and has a very high amount of protein. The taste is very good, not chalky or pasty.However, you can get these cheaper at Target - a box of six is only $4.99, which is 83 cents, compared to over a dollar here (before shipping).
