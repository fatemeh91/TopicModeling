review/text: Admittedly, I've only tried a few protein powders, but this is the only one I've been able to eat. I am not a smoothie person. I want texture in my diet. I mix a scoop of the vanilla powder with Greek non-fat yogurt. It makes it taste rich and creamy. Top it with lots of fresh fruit and it's unbelievably good. And when I say unbelievably good, I mean, it tastes like real food!
