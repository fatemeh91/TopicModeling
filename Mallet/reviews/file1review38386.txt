review/text: I purchased the Optima because my original Emjoi epilator finally quit working. I had been using my original Emjoi Simply Gold for many years - it lasted much longer than one might expect and performed well up until the day it stopped working. Having used an epilator for a number of years (15+), there was no other option than to buy a new one. I bought the Optima with the hopes that the dual head would work better and be more efficient than my previous one but that was not the case. It works just fine but it does not work any better than my previous model that only had one head instead of two. Some people have complained about the small size of this model and the position of the cord, but I am not really experiencing any issues with either. The head itself it a bit bulky and does make it more difficult to use under my arms and on the bikini line but I'm learning how to make it work better. It is more an issue with technique as I can make it work in hard to reach areas, I just have to adapt my technique to accommodate the different size of the unit. Because I've been using an Emjoi for so many years, I do not experience any significant pain. I would say, however, that previously I did not use it as much for underarms and bikini area and I now use it for those areas all the time (probably because it's summer) and it still is not overly painful. One downside to this model from my previous model is that the Optima is not as adept at grabbing really short hairs and I find some frustration when it won't work as quickly as my previous model. Again, I believe a change in technique might help produce a better result.
