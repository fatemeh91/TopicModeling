review/text: It is amazing how little of this product you need to get a rich, full lather to cover your face (multiple times). My tub has lasted five full months of once-daily use, and I still have slightly less than half of it left. As for quality, I have never experienced as close or comfortable a shave as I have with T&H Ultimate Comfort Shaving Cream. I use a Merkur Futura DE razor for days when I have time for a full shaving experience, and a disposable two-blade for the days when I am rushed, and the results are always top-notch when I use this cream on top of a Proraso Pre-Shave Cream. Do not be put off by the price tag on this product, as it is really an investment in nearly a year worth of close, comfortable shaves.
