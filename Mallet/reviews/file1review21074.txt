review/text: Reading reviews of other heating pads, there were some complaints about the heating pad not being hot enough. That's not the case with this one. In fact, it's hotter than I would like so I have to use a towel with it. Also I do not wrap it completely around my neck. It does have a timer, but I turn it off early because the heat is so intense. If you lie back in your recliner with it on, the heat will be even more intense. I would have given this 5 stars if there was a temp regulator on it.
