review/text: I was a little hesitant to try tablets in my dishwasher but having used them four times now I must admit that they work beautifully. However, I NEVER overload my dishwasher and will run a load with just a few dishes rather than have clutter in the kitchen. I always wash my pots and pans by hand most of which are Calphalon and hang back on the hanging rack or place with stacking pots, even the heavy duty stainless steel pots, as well as my Henckels knives by hand. Unfortunately, I still have two huge Lemon Cascade bottles to use up, if I ever do. I really like these nice little tablets and I'm sure I will find them in a local super market. One tablet in the closing dispenser and you're done. Excellent.
