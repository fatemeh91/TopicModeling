review/text: I bought it as a gag gift for a baby shower but when I put the battery in and turned it on nothing. I am waiting to hear back from them about wether or not I can return it since it didn't work at all. It's pretty cheap so I guess you get what you pay for. If I was using it as it was intended I think I'd invest in a much better one.
