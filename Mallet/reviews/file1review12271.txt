review/text: My RN recommended the brand but I decided to go with the one a day version. The pills smell a bit funny but I have always had a keen sense of smell even prior to pregnancy. I tae one first thing each morning with water or juice and i feel just fine.Very easy to take, no gas what so ever. My nails have started to grow very fast, my skin is soft and supple. I have only been using it for 2 weeks so I gave it 4 stars otherwise I would have given it 5. Maybe in a few weeks I can update to 5 stars should the pill continue to work well with my body.
