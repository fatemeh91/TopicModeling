review/text: I cannot imagine a day without my Garden of Life Perfect Food Shake in the morning. I'm a 52-year old runner and triathlete and find that downing "my green drink" sets my body for the upcoming run or workout. I strongly recommend this drink to all the folks I train. Recently I "hooked" my husband on it. As a middle school teacher and football coach he needs all the energy he can muster. And during football season George says "it's a must".
