review/text: I have used Benefiber for years and can tell you it is a superior product. That said, in the last 6 months I have found it impossible to purchase in my regular stores. After checking, and finding it on Amazon late last year, I have watched the price double then triple, or more, in price. This product is NECESSARY to some and a shortage from the manufacturer (due to internal problems with one plant's quality control) caused me to contact the manufacturer. The shortage has brought out the vultures and price gouging has become the norm. I'm all for anyone making a buck, but there is a point at which it becomes greed. I did contact Amazon regarding the extreme price hike and they did agree that there were some taking unjust advantage, but they do not control the pricing of their Seller's. After necessary purchases from seller's promising delivery dates that were not kept, I again contacted the manufacturer just recently. I am happy to say that Benefiber should be back on store shelves at regular prices very soon. Until then, I will assist my elderly friends with other products that are nearly as good but far less expensive. There are seller's here on Amazon I will never purchase anything from again. Not only because of the price gouging but because of broken promises and even out right lies.
