review/text: I'm able to release a lot of tension in my back with the Back Buddy. My back flexibility has increased tremendously. I do use other items, and do yoga regularly too. The use of this and then a trigger point foam roller has really been amazing for me. It was also really helpful after discomfort that followed being rear ended.
