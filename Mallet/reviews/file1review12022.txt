review/text: I have mixed opinions about this product. Although I felt really well in the first weeks, in the 6th and 7th weeks of my pregnancy I felt super bad after taking these vitamins. During those weeks when I was more susceptible to nausea and vomiting, I felt even worse after taking these vitamins. The smell, the taste of pills made me feel really sick in my stomach. Actually when I was vomiting I tasted the bad flavor of this product in my mouth. Today I would not recommend these vitamins. Furthermore, be careful if you are taking these vitamins associated with Rainbow 1 DHA. Please watch your vitamins intake because the excess of some vitamins may be dangerous for you and your baby.
