review/text: BabyCatalog.com has this white with black "trim" color combination for sale ($ cheaper!) - which I purchased for my baby boy. We are bypassing the usual potty and just using this trainer.Even though Jason is barely almost 3-months old, we have introduced the trainer to him. We place him on the trainer and support him while he sits on it to poop straight into the toilet, once a day. It can get tiring if you squat in front of the porcelain bowl to support your baby, so get the step stool at the same time for you to sit on it now and face the baby.Your baby will enjoy looking at you front and center. The splash guard on the front is great - you won't get pee'd by your baby boy. And it also serves as a privacy guard.We put a regular suction hook on the side of the toilet tank and it holds the Baby Bjorn trainer well. My mom toilet-trained my older sister and I before we were 1 year old by a similar style trainer (Baby Bjorn wasn't around in the late 1960-70s.) My mom also potty-trained my sister's three sons by the time they were 1 using just the trainer and no actual potty "bucket". My sister purchased an extra trainer to take along trips and to use in public restrooms.You will use this trainer for as long as your child's bottom is much smaller than the regular toilet seat. So it is truly worth the $ price tag and hence my 5-stars.
