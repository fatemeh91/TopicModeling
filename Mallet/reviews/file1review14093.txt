review/text: I purchased this for my mother, as she was unable to lift her legs to step into the tub. So we needed a bench that extended past the edge of the tub so she could sit and then we could help her lift her legs and swivel into the tub. The bar on the side helps her pull herself over and I think, as she gets stronger, thanks to this bench, she'll be able to handle it by herself before long.I like that it has a back on it but it doesn't feel too sturdy. Two slats slide/snap into place and it's a little wobbly. It's probably secure enough but I'm not completely confident. I'm sure it will hold my mother's weight if she needed to put her full upper body weight on it but I'd be a little wary of that for anyone that weighs more (my mother weighs about 140 lbs.).Their bathroom is small and they use a portable commode seat over the toilet so that it's raised higher, so we cannot leave the bench in the bathroom when it's not in use. We have to take the commode seat out and then bring the bench in. If they didn't need the other seat, it would fit well enough to leave it in there, but the legs do extend a little farther out than I thought they would.I like that the seat is all one piece. The slit to allow water to drain off falls right on the edge of my parents' tub and sometimes water drips onto the floor, so we keep a towel on the floor. It's never very much, though. I hear a little water sloshing around when I carry it out of the bathroom so water is getting into it somewhere. When my mother sits on it you can hear some air being expelled from the plastic seat, so that's probably where the water is getting in.So, the bench could use some tweaks but overall it's been a great help.
