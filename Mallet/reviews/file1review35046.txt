review/text: I have been using Rescue remedy for 17 years now. I first bought it to help me with my anxiety going over bridges. Later on I developed panic attacks and Rescue Remedy pulls me through every time! It is a great instant anxiety reliever, and I am never without a bottle!The nest thing about Rescue Remedy is the fact that it works fast, and is completely safe...never any side effects!\I got my last bottle at Amazon.com for $10.00 Less then what I would have paid in a health Food Store!
