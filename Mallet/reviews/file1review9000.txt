review/text: Just to clear up the false claim that the product had too much iron. Now the version 10.3 has the TYPO corrected.I have only used this a few times so far, but its perfect. Just a scoop a day in my water, juice , or protein smoothie and Im good to go. No strong offsetting taste or smell. Its very fresh smelling, and nice.Also if you mix a scoop in a food like blended greens or a salad dressing you can eat it as a food chew), and its lovely.I also mix a small amount in my dogs food daily. She loves it dry from my hand also.This stuff is a winner babySoon I'm going to make home made protein bars, and mix in a few scoops.Organic almond butter, organic dates, organic hemp seeds, organic coconut oil, green vibranceProper Care & StorageGreen Vibrance contains more friendly, healthful probiotics than any other superfood. ******* Please store Green Vibrance in your freezer *******(best) or refrigerator (good) after opening.
