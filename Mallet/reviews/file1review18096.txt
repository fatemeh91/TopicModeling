review/text: This product is excellent. It quite literally feels like a bra for your eyes. I ordered it because I need to sleep during the day and can't put blackout curtains up in my apartment. This does a great job of blocking out the light. I am a side sleeper so when I put my head on the pillow the mask moves a little and light gets through where it meets my nose, but with a little pulling and repositioning of the mask it completely covers my eyes. The part that covers your eyes does not touch your eyelids so no rubbing or uncomfortableness there. The mask is secured to your head by Velcro which is stretchy and doesn't cut off the circulation. Great product, would definitely purchase again.
