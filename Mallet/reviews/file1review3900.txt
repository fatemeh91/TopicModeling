review/text: As I read everyone's reviews, it took me awhile to figure out how to properly put it on. It is kind of a hassle to dry up your teeth, gums, and mouth area in order to get a perfect fit. But I managed to get most of them on just right. I had trouble with making sure it is in the right position because I kept thinking if it was too far to the right or left. I didn't know what to do with the saliva that kept coming out of my mouth so I just ended up swallowing it before it reach my teeth. I did notice sensitivity but it wasn't that painful, but my fingers were stinging really badly when I didn't wash them right away after applying them.I was only semi-pleased with the results only because of a few factors I encoutered. Part of my teeth weren't white enough, like the ones at the ends. This was due to the problem that I didn't position the strips perfectly and the ends usually start falling off. It did make my teeth a little whiter but not completely white, I'm not sure if a second box of that will help. It would be nice if extra stripes were given for free just to practice putting it on.I was happy with the results for about a month. My only discouragement is how can I maintain that result if I drink coffee and tea everyday? Currently my teeth looks exactly the way it was before I used the Crest White Strips, I'm just disappointed that I wasn't able to maintain the same whiteness. I can't really carry a toothbrush and tooth paste around me all the time, I guess I should look into chewing whitening gums.
