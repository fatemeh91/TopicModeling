review/text: Overall, this protein is the best for price and quality. I wanted a flavor to mix with water since chocolate isn't too great although it is still consumable. I've read somewhere that tropical punch mixed with water tasted like kool-aid or real "tropical punch" so I ended up buying the 2 lb just in case it wasn't so good. Well, it definitely does NOT taste like tropical punch or kool aid...tastes more like a watered down strawberry shake, or let's say a very bland tropical punch. it is still drinkable but i don't enjoy it too much. i would rather have just stuck with double rich chocolate since it tastes amazing with milk and is drinkable with water. for this flavor, i won't be trying it with milk. I still give the powder itself 5 stars only because the flavor doesn't affect the performance.
