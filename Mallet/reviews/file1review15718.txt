review/text: I just purchased this pen 2 days ago and so far it has been fabulous. I am an auditor and require red and black ink, as well as a pencil, this makes my life so much easier and I don't have to worry about carrying 3 pens around with me. I am going to take the suggestion of one of the other posters and order some additional refills, so I won't be scrambling when it runs out.
