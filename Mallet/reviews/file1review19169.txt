review/text: These tests are NOT - I repeat, NOT anywhere near as sensitive as they claim. The other drug store brands such as EPT, First Response and ClearBlue are much more sensitive and reliable. I got a positive on all the above mentioned and this "super sensitive" "early pregnancy test" did not show a positive until days later. Even then, the test line was faint and not as dark as the control line. Finally NOW - I am over eight weeks pregnant and decided I already own these ridiculous things, might as well use them - now I get a bright purple test line. Don't buy them, they arrive quickly, but they don't show results early....they should be called "later than all the rest pregnancy tests."
