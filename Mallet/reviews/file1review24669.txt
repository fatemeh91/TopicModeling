review/text: The younger generation, or people in good health should be perfectly fine taking the recommended dose, unless your allergic to some of the ingredients. Yes, it makes you naseous. Yes, it makes you bouncy and wired. Its a caffiene pill, what do you expect?! If you want to lose weight bad enough, you deal with it. As you take it you should get used to it. I felt like crap taking it for the first time yesterday, but then I took it this morning and I'm completely fine. Just as long as you drink a lot of water with it, which you should do on a daily basis anyways, it will work. Exercise, eat healthy, take the recommended dose, and wala!
