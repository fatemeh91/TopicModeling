review/text: It was a winter morning and I noticed that my husband had shoes, but no socks on. He told me he could no longer bend down AND put socks on at the same time. I figured that there had to be something out these to help him. Sure enough, there was the Deluxe Sock Aid. Big name for a great little gizmo. My husband often comments: "This is the best thing you ever got me". (What about the kids, right?) The only drawback is that the cloth covering unravels pretty fast. The first one I bought is still haning in by some threads. The second one is yet unharmed by the daily use.
