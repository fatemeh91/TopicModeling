review/text: If I had all the information on how to get a good shave with a single edge that is now available on the Internet, I would probably still be using my old Schick injector instead of abandoning it many years ago. Since that item is missing, I tried the Merkur 178 to apply this new (to me) knowledge. The heavy weight and handle length make it easy to get the right angle and pressure to learn the wet shaving method. So far I have been able to learn with this one with only very minimal damage to my face.
