review/text: I was surprised to read the negative comments on this dish washer detergent. It has worked great for me. No problems at all. I have not even followed the directions to rinse the dishes before turning the dishwasher on. All dishes have come out clean and shiny. Maybe it something to do with the model of my dishwasher.
