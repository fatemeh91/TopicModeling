review/text: From the first use out of the package this item has been ridiculouslu inconsistent and inaccurate. Will give me readings of 95.1 and then minutes later will read 97.4, 97.9 and then 98.8. This is a coomplete waste of money and actually quite dangerous if you need to know if someone is running a fever. Scary.
