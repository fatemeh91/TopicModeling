review/text: If you are an FMS sufferer, Elasto Gel is a great investment. I have owned the cervical and lumbar pieces for many years and they have helped me immensely. I see they now have a piece that completely covers the upper back and that will surely be on my Holiday wish list. I keep mine right in the cabinet by the microwave and pop them in many times on a high pain day. There are some days that you must move around and Elasto allows you that portability. The heat will last about 40 minutes per microwave and if you need more time you just pop them in again. It is heaven to heat one and lay down for a nap. If you want to add a little aroma therapy you can slip a scented fabric softener sheet between the washable cover and the elasto gel!
