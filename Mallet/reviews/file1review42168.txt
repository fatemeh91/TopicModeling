review/text: I love this diaper. It is very easy to use. The insert is sewn into the diaper, so there is no need to stuff it as the pocket diaper. The Safari print is cute and the velcro works great and is much easier to use than snaps. I had one thirsties diaper with velcro and I had to return it as the velcro stopped working after only few uses, it is not the case with this diaper. I rarely have leaks with this diaper and I use it as my overnight diaper. The price is great as well. I wish I had more of these in my stash.Update: I gave this diaper 5 stars at the beginning. However, after two months of use the diaper started leaking and I have bad ammonia smell issues. The problem is that this diaper comes with no washing instructions. I bleached my prefolds as a last resort for the smell, but I don't want to damage these AIO diapers, so I didn't bleach them. I contacted the company through Amazon and I got no response. Their web site says nothing about washing care and when I tried to contact them through the contact form on their web site it gives me an error. The customer service of this company is terrible!!!
