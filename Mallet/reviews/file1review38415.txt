review/text: It hurts like the dickens, but what do you expect? It says it right in the description that it pulls the hair directly from the root. If you have thick hair, or long hair, it might be a good idea to trim it down a bit before you begin. I've always had woolly mammoth arm hair, so that hurt way worse than doing my legs. I let my leg hair grow out a week before I tried it and it worked great. Not a super smooth feel, but I figure that each hair is growing at a different stage, so it will probably take a couple of times before I get that "silky" feeling. It's been several weeks and I feel like I have the "day after" feel on my legs, but my arms are still silky.
