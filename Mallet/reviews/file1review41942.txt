review/text: I really love the way this cream makes my skin feel so moisturized. After I apply it to my face my skin feels like velvet. I was using a much more expensive brand and so far this cream surpasses the benefits of the other cream at half the price. I wish I would have bought this cream sooner and I am so glad it's available on Amazon.com for a very reasonable price. Next I'm going to try the facial pads and am hoping they work as superbly as this cream.
