review/text: I own and run 2 math tutoring centers and our students bring in small snacks like pretzels and crackers. We also make popcorn on occasion so our floors can get a bit messy. These units have worked very well for picking up crumbs and small objects on low pile carpet. In addition, my daughter had a friend spill a bunch of jumping beans all over our bare basement floor and this unit was a champ.I've had people comment that these work better than a electric vacuum and I rely on them a lot.What I've found after extensive use over 10-11 months is that the units stop working in part because they brushes get clogged. We have cleaned out the brushes several times cutting out hair and lint and other debris that clogs them, but the units are hardly like new. I guess this is not so bad considering the units only cost about $25. Still, if I have to purchase a new one every year - after 4-5 years that's about the same time I'd expect an electric vacuum to work. I'm not a fan of just throwing things away so I may order new brushes. We didn't use these units that heavily, maybe 3-4 times a day to pick up debris under 5 or 6 chairs and a few tables.I did call the Bissell support line to ask if they had any tips about cleaning the units and they weren't too helpful. They said I could order new brushes or order a new unitl.Overall, I'd still give this unit 4 stars as it worked very well and did what it needed to do. I wasn't looking for something to do the job of a vacuum, just a quiet unit that would clean up debris until we could vacuum after we closed and this works great for that.
