review/text: I love Tweezerman tweezers. They truly are the best. I bought these for my purse and diaper bag, for emergency tweezing situations! ;) They are as good as the normal sized ones, just in a smaller package. Someone else mentioned the container, that since it is smaller, it is stronger to keep them in than the larger container, and I agree. My larger container broke right away, the smaller one is much more solid. You cannot go wrong with these, they will last forever, and Tweezerman offers lifetime sharpening if need be. Even better!
