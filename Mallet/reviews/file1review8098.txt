review/text: ... and I just might be the world's biggest fan of the entire OXO Good Grips line. But for me this brush is too short and the bristle part is too fat &amp; too soft. HOWEVER! It turned out to be good for something else... Try filling it with a very good moisturizing hand soap and using it *occasionally* to scrub reeeeeeeally grimy hands/nails. I hate to wear gloves while gardening, even in our red messy clay soil, and Aging SuperHubby is still too macho to wear gloves while D.I.Y.-ing, lol -- so this brush has found a home on our utility sink next to the basement door.
