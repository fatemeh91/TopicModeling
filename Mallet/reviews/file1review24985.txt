review/text: I have to agree with the other reviewers that say not to buy this product if you are regular. I used to ovulate regularly, but I have a short luteal cycle so I thought this product could help me. After taking Fertilaid my cycle became very irregular. I started ovulating very late in the cycle and my luteal cycle got even shorter. I took Fertilaid for 4 months and my cycles were all over the place. As soon as I stopped, my cycle went back to normal and two months after I stopped taking Fertilaid, I got pregnant, despite the fact my luteal cycle is only 8 days. So if you are regular do not buy this product. It was a big waste of my money and time.
