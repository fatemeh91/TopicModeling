review/text: There is not another product I am so loyal to. Home Depot stopped carrying it (and sold it in the paint section???) So here I am at Amazon...No review could ever do this product justice...If you have wood cabinets, wood furniture (especially antiques) or anything you want to shine, this is the product for you...The orange smell is incredible but will go away within a couple of hours leaving your wood nourished and shiney....Like glass....JUST TRY IT
