review/text: I bought this at a local grocery store, and used on my percolator which was dark with coffee stains all the way up to 12 cups. Regular soap and water, or even cleanser could not remove the dark coffee stains. I knew that stain was sucking the life out of my percolator, much less the way the brewed coffee was tasting. I used Dip It once per the directions, and after one brewing cycle, that percolator and its parts came out shiny and brand new looking. Wow!Too bad about the vendor problems reported below by J.A. Wallace. I was hoping to find an alternate supplier.
