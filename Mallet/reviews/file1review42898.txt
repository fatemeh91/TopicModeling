review/text: I suspect that most people have standard sized 4" tiles, in which case you can't line up the suction cups over two complete tiles. I tried two different rails in two different tub areas. Each time, one of them would be over a grout line, and obviously would not create suction. The one suction cup over a complete tile has a very strong grip. However, I would not trust this item to prevent a fall.
