review/text: The product is fine, I have used for years and expect to continue using. The sale price was decent, but the shipping charge was so high that it made the transaction a poor bargain. I tried to cancel the order when I saw the shipping charge, but the website would not permit me to do so. So, I recommend the product, but not the Amazon sales tactic -- I've been burned, and will think twice in the future about buying from Amazon.
