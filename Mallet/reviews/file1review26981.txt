review/text: I've tried other whey products and always come back to this one. It is not the cheapest but it is the best one that I have used. It mixes very well. Most importantly, the taste is excellent. I used to get the Vanilla Ice Cream. It is really good if you want to mix some fruit in a blender. The Double Rich Chocolate is my standard though. The taste does not get old like some of the others I've tried. One thing I like best is that I can fill a mixing bottle (this is a great one Single 20oz Sundesa Blender Bottle) with powder, keep it with me and fill it with water when I need it. It still tases wonderful with water instead of milk.
