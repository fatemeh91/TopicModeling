review/text: My elderly aunt,who is in a nursing home,wanted a grabber that folded so she could put it in her satchel on her wheelchair.I liked this one because it seemed easy to use. It is easy to use.I also tried it around my house before I gave it to her.I picked up a jar of pickles,so it had good weight usage.I also picked up a pen,so it picks up small things too.The handle was also sturdy but not hard to squeeze.It folded easily.I purchased this last year and she still is using.
