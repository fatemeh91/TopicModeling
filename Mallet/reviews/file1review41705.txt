review/text: I bought this toothbrush as a replacement for an older Oral-B toothbrush that finally died. I must have had that toothbrush for at least 10 years and I loved it. I'm not as happy with this new one as I should be for what it cost.It's a little larger in size and heavier than the older one. The display screen is kind of fun but it only displays images when the toothbrush is running and when it's running you need to have it in your mouth to keep from splattering everywhere. So, you can't really see the display.The on/off button and the speed selector button seem to be located right where I grip the toothbrush. I keep turning it off and/or changing the speed without intending to change it.One of the features that made me select this toothbrush is the fact that it will run for approx. two weeks on a charge. I haven't had the opportunity to check this. The first 9400 I bought had a defective charging system so I had to return it. I think there are some lower priced Oral-B Toothbrushes that I would have been happier with.
