review/text: Got these blades to go in my new Merkur razor. It's not that they are a bad blade, but I recently tried Feather blades and wow what a difference! Feathers are much sharper and last longer. I have a rough beard and soft skin and Merkur blades just seem to drag and pull while cutting. The Feather blades just glide and cut.
