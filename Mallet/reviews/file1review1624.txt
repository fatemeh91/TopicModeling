review/text: The Wart Stick, is The Total Bomb....it is Highly Effective, Has Removed Two Deep Warts, One on The Outside of My Thumb &The Other, on The Top of My Forefinger...on The Same Hand...One Needs To Be Diligent, in Cleansing The Effected Area's With Really Warm Soap & Water,Then Applying The Stick To The Effected Area's, a Couple of Time's a Day..So the Medication is Absorbed into The Skin &..Keeping Ur Fingers Freshly, Wrapped in a Regular Bandage...Over The Warts...Depending on the Depth & Severity & The Acuity of The Warts:It Took 5 Weeks To Remove Both Warts.....Better & Cheaper Than Surgery & or Freezing Them Off...Enjoy....You Won't Regret it....it Just Works....E Patrick
