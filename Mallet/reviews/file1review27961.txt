review/text: I would have given this 3 or more stars for taste and mixability (is that a word? : ) ), but the ingredients are terrible. Why take a health product that has unhealthy ingredients? I won't be buying this again.It has artificial flavor. BAD!And worse, it has Acesulfame artificial sweetener. Do some Googling on it. It causes cancer in animals and is reportedly worse than aspartame and saccharin.Oh well, the search goes on. If anyone knows of any good tasting chocolate protein meal replacement type powders that mix easily with milk and have healthy ingredients, please post such in the "comments" to this review.Thanks
