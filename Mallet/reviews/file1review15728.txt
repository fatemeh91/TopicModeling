review/text: I've now owned 3 of these pens personally and given several more as gifts. I misplaced the one I carry with me all the time so broke down and ordered a new one. When it arrived I immediately noticed a difference in quality versus the previous ones I had owned. The action to change from one pen to another is very stiff and at times, almost impossible. In addition, the pens just don't seem to write very well, not like the old ones I have. The red pen needs a few strokes to write at all and when it does finally write it is uneven. The black works better and the pencil, which I use the most, seems to be fine. The new stylus feature is interesting and works well enough so that's a bonus I suppose. About a week after my new pen arrived I found my old one and was able to compare to make sure I wasn't imagining the difference. Nope, it's there. The older pen (about 8 years old) still works perfectly, the new one, not so much.
