review/text: I first took Milk Thistle in Europe on advice from a doctor for my liver. I took it sporadically when I was in Canada. I am now down here in CA. and am now 50 and feeling my age. I noticed getting up 2-3 times during the night to urinate. I got milk thistle again for my liver, but noticed a serindipitous side effect...I wasn't getting up in the night as much on 250 mg, all I could find. I just happened to search for it on Amazon and I found Wonder Labs with their 1000mg softgels.I now sleep thru the night, have way more energy during the day. I am back to excercising, losing weight and feeling much better about myself. I will be buying this product for the rest of my life. I have even got my X-wife on it and she is now hooked! I had never heard of this company nor do I have any affiliation with them. They have the best product for the BEST price and I will definitely be spreading the news to my friends as they have noticed the change in my energy levels because of a better nights sleep....not what I originally got it for! I highly recommend this product and they have others I will be trying as well!
