review/text: It does work and it does seem to pull the hair -however short it is- from its roots. The shaver head works better but hair grows back faster this way. It's OK but not the best epilation product I've ever used. I used to have Epilady by Braun which worked much better. Neither the "4-way moving pain softener" nor the "efficiency pro clip" is necessary for me. Being used to hot wax I don't feel pain. Without the pain softener gadget it still does not hurt at all (experience based on legs only). I only wish Silk Epil were more powerful. You need to go either very slowly or go over the same place several times. Despite all the negative things I wrote it is the best product I found in the market. Let me know if you find something better. Carrying pouch is stylish and is handy to keep all the pieces together.
