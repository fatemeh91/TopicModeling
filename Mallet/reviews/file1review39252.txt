review/text: I ordered this kit as a Christmas present for my sister's fiance. The item description said that it comes with a DVD. When it arrived, there was no DVD (the reason I only gave it four stars). This would have been helpful, as my sister had never cut hair before. They are impressed with how easy the clippers are to use. She cut his hair once not long after Christmas and is planning to do so again, tomorrow. Before their wedding, however, he will get his hair cut by a professional.
