review/text: I have to monitor my blood pressure on a regular basis. This model is simple to use as it has a self-inflating cuff. The read out appeared to be accurate as it was in the ball park of readings at the doctor's office. I would recommend this product, especially if you have to monitor your pressure regularly. The price is right for this useful product.
