review/text: I have used this device for several years, while living with progressive MS, and find that it remains completely effective, showing no signs of wear after close to a decade of use. It has supported the weight of people over 250 pounds and ranging in height from barely 5 ft tall to 6 ft ` (my tallest visitor). I had a previous device whose front support had a piece running along the floor in front of the toilet, which interfered with my feet when I tried to stand. The feet of this device raise up a bit, to clean underneath easily, but we've had no problem with twisting out of shape or rocking loose the supports of the toilet seat, despite grandchildren playing with the device. It is easy to clean around and has a minimal "signature." It's adjustability is superior to other devices we've tried, so we recommend it based on years of satisfaction. In fact, We've given my original to my elderly parents so now need a replacement for our home. For people with friends of varying ages, I would recommend this device for guest bathrooms.
