review/text: Almond Fudge is my favorite Balance Bar and keeps me going on the run. I have special needs: dairy and gluten intolerant, and this Balance Bar not only works for me, it tastes good. Believe me, safe food that tastes good and that you can keep in your bag for an emergency is not easy to find!
