review/text: I have knots in one shoulder that have been causing severe pain for years...have been to doctors for injections, chiropractor for manual treatments and electrical stim, have tried ice and heat...nothing worked. Direct pressure to the area is the only thing that gave relief...but it is in a place on my body that I cannot reach, so had to always ask my husband or family member to "press on it" for a long time. I now can use the Body Back Buddy whenever I get the pain and the constant pressure I can apply with the product almost immediately eliminates or reduces the pain. No more begging for someone else to do it for me.
