review/text: What I ordered (and what was pictured) was the Aloe Vesta 2-n-1 body wash and shampoo in a creme form. What was shipped to me was a foam. I had ordered another item on Amazon (from a different company). Both items were in stock...but it took about 3 days longer to get this item...and it was wrong (not what I ordered). Because I am housebound, I kept it...but will think twice about ordering again.
