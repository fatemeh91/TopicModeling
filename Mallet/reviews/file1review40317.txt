review/text: This is a great product but taking the recommended dose of 2 capsules 5 times a day is a bit much. The capsules are about 1/2" long and made of vegetable cellulose so they are easy to swallow. They are 100% vegetarian, dairy free, an have no gluten-containing ingredients. They are not listed as Vegan.Do not take them if you are pregnant or taking pharmaceutical drugs.I'm sure this would work much better and faster, if I could only remember to take it 5 times a day.update: had strep and was treated with antibiotics, tested negative after 10 days, then felt a common cold coming on. Took this bottle for two days and felt like the cold was not as severe as it could have been. It was still hard to take 5 times a day, and I wasn't always on schedule, but I do feel like it worked well.
