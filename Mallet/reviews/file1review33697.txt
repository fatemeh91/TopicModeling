review/text: This product has been around for a long time without any essential design or construction changes except that it is now made in China whereas it was originally made in America. Unfortunately, this means that it is held back by substandard design choices.In my personal experience the weak link is the flexible hose between the pump body and the nozzle head. While I can appreciate that it must be both flexible and capable of containing the water pressure created by the pump so the hose materials are crucial. However, the longevity of the hose material is inadequate. I note that some people report getting seven years use, that has not been my experience: it seems to be less than five for me. The problem is that the hose material loses its suppleness and hardens. When it hardens, it can break if flexed beyond its decreasing flex limits. There is no point in buying the replacement head (see http://www.amazon.com/WaterPik-hose-repair-kit-handle/dp/B000A8EHU6/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8&qid;=1354727663&sr;=8-10&keywords;=waterpik+replacement), as I did, and attempting to attach it as the instructions suggest. That is because one is still faced with the reduced elasticity of the original hose into which the replacement hose is meant to fit. The old hose splits rather than expanding when one tries to insert the supplied male-male couple. There seems to be left only the choices of doing without or purchase a new unit. The implicit cost of the latter option is about $10 per year (+electricity). Is it worth it? There is a third option which the Waterpik company strongly discourages. That is to take the unit apart (a tricky, but possible, thing to do) and fit the replacement nozzle head and hose combination directly onto the pump, thereby replacing the sclerotic original hose. That saves about $25 dollars.Surely, modern technology can come up with better material choices than those of this dated product.
