review/text: Well I just received my Pocket Rocket on Nov 28th . It was shipped ahead of expected time from Amazon. I decided to try it the same day , and I'm glad I did.It was well worth the money and it does pack a mighty punch. It's not that quiet but it's not real loud either.All I can say is I started using it , and I was waking up like 3 hrs later with a smile on my face. I love that I can just stick it in my purse and go. I should Marry My Pocket Rocket !
