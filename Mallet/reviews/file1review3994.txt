review/text: The replacement blades, which cost big money, definitely last very little time before they become dull. I thought I was the only one who noticed this and switched to a Braun electric razor but if you read the other reviews you'll see that other men have done this as well.I got the Braun Series 7- 790cc (9595) Pulsonic Shaver for $199.99 about a year ago, and periodically (right now for example) you can get $50.00 in gift certificates with the purchase of any Braun electric razor that is over $130.00. So I got an amazing razor, the best they make for $150.00 since I'm def going to be using the gift certificates for stuff I need. I no longer have to buy a new pack of blades every 4 weeks (only have to replace the blade set once a year now for $25.00) and no shave cream (have to buy a few cleaning and lubrication packs though for about $40.00 for a years worth) and I never get irritated skin anymore.So now I spent $150.00 + $25.00 + $50.00 = $225.00 for the first year and a half I've used this razor instead of $25.00 x 18 months (what I had been paying every 4 weeks for blades) + $100.00 (18 months of shave cream) + $15 for stupid razor handle-thing= $565.00So Gillette Fusion, or comparable manual razors, cost roughly 2.5 times what it cost me to operate the best Braun electric razor. Most men might not change their blades as often as I did but the things got dull so quick I don't see how it could be avoided.
