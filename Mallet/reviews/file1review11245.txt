review/text: The 'little' series is usually pretty good, but this is an exception I've found. My wife, wanting something less nasty than milk of magnesia to help our 2 year old have a bm, brought this home. "It tastes like chocolate" is what she said, trusting the label. Our innoccent son tried it and then choked and threw up. Poor guy. I tried it later.... man, was it nasty. It says to 'slowly' administer it to inner cheek. I don't think many kids would go for this. The only way would be mixing it into something already strong tasting and only a few drops at a time. The best is to modify diet and lots of fluids, but good ol milk of magnesia does the trick when you need it.
