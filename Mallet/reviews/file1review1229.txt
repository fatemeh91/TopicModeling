review/text: I have been taking astragalus supplements for a very long time. I dicided to give Gaia's liquid gel pill a try, hoping for better absorption. However, only after a couple of days of taking it, I developed a lot of hives all over my body. When I examed the pills, I saw that every pill was only half filled with liquid. This can be indications that the pills were very old that the liquid had been dried up and poor packaging. I stoped taking it and threw out the opened bottle. I kept the unopened one so I can send to a lab for testing later. Will NEVER buy any Gaia product again!
