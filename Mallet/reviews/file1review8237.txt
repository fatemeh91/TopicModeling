review/text: This is one of my favorite bottle brushes because the bristles are soft and evenly dispersed, including the tip of the brush where we need to reach into corners, crevices and bottoms of vessels such as thermoses, carafes, baby bottles, wine and drinking glasses without scratching their surfaces. The handle is sturdy and won't bend like wire-made brushes. I recommend this brush.
