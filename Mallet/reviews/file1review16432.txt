review/text: Columbia Antiseptic Powder has been around for years and years. My parents used it, and their parents before them. I use it too. It's great for many things, itching, sunburn, doesn't burn like other stuff so it's good for sensitive areas. Much much better than "baby powder". It's getting a bit hard to locate in real stores, which is a shame. Try it -- I think you'll like it better than other powders you might have tried.
