review/text: I took the fenugreek pills according to the directions and did not notice any noticeable increase in my milk supply. I had much more luck with Motherlove More Milk Special Blend which was recommended by a woman in my Mommy & Me class (she said make sure it's the "special blend" pills which you can also find on Amazon).
