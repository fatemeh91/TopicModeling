review/text: My daughter has had chronic nasal drainage since birth and has had numerous sinus infections. After using this product, she can, on many days, go without wiping her nose all day. It has cut down on her infections and she hasn't had a real sore nose from wiping it all day. I highly recommend everyone to try this if they have chronic sinus gunk or allergies.
