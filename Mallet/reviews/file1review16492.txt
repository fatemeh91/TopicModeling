review/text: I have suffered with what my doctor labeled as "IBS" for a little over a year now. Through my own research, I found that the cause might be low stomach acid. I did the unintelligent thing and started on Betaine HCL without consulting my doctor. (You should always consult your doctor.)I have to say it's helping a great deal. I'm no longer "sick" every morning. I can eat meat again. If this is such a help, why 3 stars?Have you ever owned a reptile, or had other cause to breed crickets? Have you ever had a large die-off where you keep said insects?The smell is literally exactly the same. These pills also have an incredibly strong aftertaste, which, sadly, is the same.There are other brands around which are not disgusting. Look for them.
