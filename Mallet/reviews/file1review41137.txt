review/text: This is a great tasting bar, under 200 calories, low sugar, high fiber, great for snacking or post-workout. The only problem is they do not stay in stock! I would love to get regular shipments, but they are always on back order........So, please, everyone, stop ordering these, so I can get my auto shipments on time!
