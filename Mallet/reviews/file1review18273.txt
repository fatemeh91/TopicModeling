review/text: When my husband & I tried this, I had the same horrified reaction most people here did. If you're going for a more slippery feel, go with the K-Y Silk. He prefers Intrigue because it ISN'T as slippery. There is more friction with this stuff. We've settled into somewhat of a routine & take turns with Intrigue & Silk. They're just two completely different sensations, but Intrigue seems to be more compatible with the male experience. I don't hate it like I used to (it's great in the shower because it doesn't rinse away), but I still prefer Silk.It's worth trying, but just don't buy it expecting the same from a silicone-based product as you would from a water-based product.
