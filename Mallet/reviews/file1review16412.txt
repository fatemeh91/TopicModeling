review/text: I've used this Herb Pharm product as antibacterial both internally and externally and it works well. Certainly don't replace Rx antibiotics if they are required but when I get a deep cut in the garden I dilute the wormwood solution with distilled water and apply to the cut every so often. Also take a few drops in a glass of water to get stomach back to normal when it's out of sorts, dreadful taste but effective. Only once every few months internally and just a few drops. Pretty powerful stuff. It stains skin and clothes so be careful.
