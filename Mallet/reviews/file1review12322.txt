review/text: I didn't even have to order any of this product to see that it is inferior. First, it only contains 150MG of Omega-3 fatty acids. Most high quality fish oil supplements will contain 3 or 4 times that. Plus that means you are paying for 850mg of "other" fish oil---not the good Omega 3 kind. Plus it states the product is "extracted solely from already harvested salmon using fish parts that would otherwise be wasted..." In other words, it uses parts of the fish that humans do not eat like the heads and organs. Good fish oil is made from the flesh of the fish. Avoid this product and buy some by a reputable manufacturer.
