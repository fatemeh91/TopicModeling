review/text: This is a really great product.Quick and easy to use and very versatile in applying heat to where desired.One caution do NOT overheat these as the seams will degrade quite fast and cause a rupture that could cause you a nasty burn getting the inside gel directly on your skin.Used with appropriate caution (when taking them out of the microwave and keeping an eye on their seam integrity) this neckwarmer can really hit the spot.
