review/text: The Braun Shaver with this foil and cutter gives a close and comfortable shave. The one shortcoming is that the shaver signals for a replacement foil and cutter well before the 18 month lifespan of the cutter. Since my Braun continues to function well, I am leaving the current foil and cutter on the shaver until I have reason to replace them.
