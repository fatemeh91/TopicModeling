review/text: I'm an avid tennis player and frequently need to tape up my fingers to prevent blisters or to protect them from getting worse. Most tape that you buy in sporting goods stores comes in 1 1/2" widths which is too wide and they charge up to $5.00 for one roll. This 1" tape is the perfect width and protects quite well and buying it by the box I pay about a third of the price per roll. I'm not sure about other brands but this J & J Zonas tape is the best for sports and my purposes. I highly recommend!!!
