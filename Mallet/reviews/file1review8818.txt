review/text: I think I have done this before. But I can't say enough good things about this product. I have had digestive problems most of my adult life and since using Green Vibrance - we call it "green stuff" in our house - I feel better than I have in years. It is expensive, in my humble opinion, but well worth. It tastes terrible. If it didn't work so well, I would look for something else.
