review/text: I experienced athletes foot for the first time in my life recently - I think I got it from trying on a friend's shoe. Never had the problem before and suddenly I had all kinds of itching and discomfort on my toes and feet to the point where I could not sleep. I purchased 2 different kinds of creams - all they did was alleviate the itching, but did not solve/cure the problem.Finally I stumbled onto Pedifix and thought I'd give it a try. After one use, I only had very light itching on the toe areas, after the 2nd day of use, my problem was completely cleared up. I do not usually write reviews, but I really want anyone who is having similar problems to try this as it does work. Don't expect an 'immediate' fix, but you will definitely get immediate relief - and if you continue to use for more than a day, it does exactly what it says it will - eliminates any kind of fungus from the skin.
