review/text: I am a long distance truck driver and was having a a very hard time driving my shift because I was so tired from tossing and turning during the night as I would get severe hot flashes. I asked at my health store for a recommendation and she recommended NW DIM. I have never been happier. After taking it for 3 weeks I started to notice I was sleeping thru the night and even noticed that the day time hot flashes were all but non existent. After 4 weeks the hot flashes were gone completely. I get lots of compliments on my skin but had not thought to give DIM the credit. I have been taking DIM for 8 months and can't live without it.I have recommended this to my other trucker friends and everyone is hooked on DIM. Our husbands are happy to :)
