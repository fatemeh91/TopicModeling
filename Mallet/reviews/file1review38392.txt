review/text: I use this to remove the hair from my Italian arms and love it for that! My arms are silky smooth and stay that way even when the hair grows in. I have had this product for 10 years and it still works great! I recommend:-getting a professional wax first and then start using this-showering and exfoliating and then pulling hairs right after shower-it does hurt at first, but gets less painful, but there is always a little pain with it. the more often you do it, the less hairs that are grown back and the easier the removal.I have done my kneecaps, feet, toes (sometimes I get ingrown hairs on my toes since it pulls it out so hard) and that is the only place besides arms/hands/fingers that I can tolerate it. I found it way too rough for my face and made me break out and extremely painful at the bikini line.It works great though. So if you can take the pain, buy it. It has saved me a ton of money on waxing my arms!
