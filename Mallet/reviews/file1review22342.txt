review/text: After my initial recovery from an RCL tear in my left thumb (7 weeks in a cast, 8 weeks in a removable hard splint, and 11 weeks of OT), I was looking for a brace that would support my thumb but allow movement of my wrist. I'm pretty active in exercise(swimming, yoga, Pilates, aerobics, water aerobics, weight training), so I needed something that I could wear while doing these activities. The CHAMPION Neoprene Wrist/Thumb Support did not have the support I was looking for. I wore it once during a water aerobics class and in order to get any support from this item I had to adjust the tightness to the point that my hand went numb. This product would be great if it had some support bars along the sides and top of the thumb.
