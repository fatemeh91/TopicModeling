review/text: ...it just shouldn't involve your glass!"OVERALLI absolutely love this cleaner! Only recently my wife and I discovered Method products at Target, and since then we use as many as we can get out hands on! When we moved into our new apartment, we did a huge shop (the place needed some cleaning) and we got this Glass/Surface cleaner for the first time.It really does clean very well, windows are now a breeze and whether in the bathroom or the kitchen the minty smell is delightful. My wife thinks it smells like toothpaste...I think it smells like heaven. The spray mechanism works well (you would think that's a given...not naming any cheaper brand names...) and the bottle is big enough to have lasted us three to four months with regular use.Overall, we are absolutely sold, and will be looking no further for our all-purpose cleaning needs!WHY 5 STARS?- Quite reasonably priced- Does an incredible job- Smells WONDERFUL!p.s. I LOVE their little sayings on the product packaging...it's totally unnecessary, nor does it make me want to buy their products any more, however it is just a fun little extra that adds a smile to your day!
