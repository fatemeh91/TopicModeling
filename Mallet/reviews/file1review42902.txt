review/text: The suction cups will not hold unless on very clean, or smooth surfaces. Even on smooth surfaces, one should be careful putting too much weight or pull on the handle because the suction cups could loosen from being attached. It happened to me. Luckily the other end was still attached and I regained balance before it got completely detached. Have to throw it away before any untoward accident happens.
