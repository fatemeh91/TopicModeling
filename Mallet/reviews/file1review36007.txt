review/text: This stuff tastes like pure death and probably one of the worst tastes you will ever experience. That said I found a good way to make it bearable. Lemon juice concentrate takes the bite out. The key is to add enough. Adding a decent amount will turn it into a yellow gatorade color but you have to go past that keep adding enough until the water looks like a natural lemonade / soapy water color. Then you are at point where it doesn't taste great but definitely drinkable.Rating this 3 stars because the money you save buying this in powder form you pretty much pay for in calories or money making it drinkable. I havent tried vinegar yet but if that works than that might make it cheap enough to be somewhat worthwile.I would stick to capsules next time instead.
