review/text: These bars are excellent. They taste great and give you lots of lasting energy. We used them while out in the woods picking morel mushrooms. When energy would lag, some water and a clif bar were the perfect pick me up. The best part is that it is organic, something we are trying to eat more and more of. Highly recommend!! Oh, don't let the looks fool you they are not very nice looking.
