review/text: First it doesn't "spray" it sort of blobs onto clothing and you have to rub it into the stain. Second it is less effective than just making a paste out of tide and doing the same thing. If you don't want to mix your detergent into a paste so you save 30 seconds by rubbing the foamy blobs into the stains it might be worth the effort.Perhaps a spray nozzle that is adjustable would make it a better value, but since it only has one setting, the blob setting, its more annoying than effective.
