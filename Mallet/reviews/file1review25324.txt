review/text: You would thing that these simple plastic cleaners would be worse then the steel or more elaborate ones, but surprisingly these work better in cleaning your tongue than the more elaborate ones.They just seem to be better at cleaning all the gunk off your tongue. I got these from my dentist and since they're not sold in store, I'm glad to find them here.
