review/text: I start off everyday with a this shake and an egg white sandwich. Boring? Maybe, but I'm fueled with 500 total calories (sandwich and shake) and 40 grams of protein to start the day. It mixes well in 30 seconds with a spoon (no shaker), and it taste great; especially, if you drink it every day.
