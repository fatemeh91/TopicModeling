review/text: This is a great product. My stepfather has developed very thin skin as he has gotten older and has to have his BP taken frequently every day. The regular arm cuff has caused quite a bit of damage to his arm. This cuff is around the wrist where the skin is a little thicker, thus saving his skin and not having to worry about infections to his upper arm. Also love the large digits on the screen. He is much happier and more willing to have his BP taken now. Thank you, Omron!
