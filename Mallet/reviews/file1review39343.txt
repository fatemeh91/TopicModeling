review/text: Underworks posture perfect band... This was ok, but not what I was expecting. I wanted something to hold my shoulders back so I wouldn't be slouched all the time. This does not to the trick; it's too big for one (5"7, female, broader than most) and it lets me slouch in it. I am trying to find something else.
