review/text: I've used a Braun 5428 for many years and decided to upgrade to what all here say is a better shaver, i.e., the 8585. I wish I hadn't.The 8585 does NOT shave as close as my old Braun. It also takes noticably longer. I've followed all the instructional suggestions. I've been using the 8585 for about 2 months now, so I think I've got the hang of it as far as Braun's recommendations. Shaving shouldn't be rocket science.Also, I find a distinct aroma of the cleaning solution in my bathroom and in the hall outside the bathroom. No leaks, just the evaporation of the cleaning fluid. Not offensive, but noticable and unexpected.Overall, a step down from my old shaver at a higher price and with the added monthly cost of the cleaning solution. OK, but not recommended.
