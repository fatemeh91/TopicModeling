review/text: This is a solid make-up mirror for the price - nice size, shape, 3-level lighting, and magnification. The ultra-magnification spot on the one side is perfect for a close-up view of an eye (or whatever).... From an aesthetic standpoint, I'm not a fan of the pock-marks on the base - they really don't add anything; but that's minor. My one real gripe with this mirror is that the light frequently (maybe twice a week or so?)goes on by itself! I initially blamed my husband and my kids - and then it happened when they weren't around - and I hadn't gone near the mirror. Not a big deal, but of course the bulb life won't be as long (and it's annoying to see that light coming from the bathroom in the middle of the night - somehow it always happens at night - or maybe that's just when I actually notice it - and to have to drag myself out of bed to turn it off.
