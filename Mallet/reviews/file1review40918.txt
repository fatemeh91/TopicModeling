review/text: This is a very good electric razor. It is so quiet, you can tell the difference of when it has finished shaving the hairs in the spot that you are shaving. You can't beat the quality for the price you pay for this shaver. I purchased the first one through mail advertisement before I found out that Amazon also had them. I then purchased 2 from Amazon at a better price. So I now have 3 total.
