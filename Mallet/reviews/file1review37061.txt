review/text: To help with the use situation, I keep the flosser part in household (3% strength) hydrogen peroxide between uses. My daughter and I each have a small container. The life of the brushes can likewise be extended with hydrogen peroxide. Totally safe, as it can be used diluted with an equal amount of water as a mouthwash.
