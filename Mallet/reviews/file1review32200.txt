review/text: This shave cream is the BEST!! I first purchased it from the Lather store in Pasadena, CA and I've never had to try a different brand since then. I've tried endless numbers of high priced shave creams to try to combat the razor burn and bumps I get from my combination of sensitive skin and hair that grows very tight against my face, but from day one of using this, I was sold. It's moisturizing without being greasy, it really helps the razor glide across your skin and it has a nice mild scent that is pleasant, but doesn't cause you to smell it all day.Here's the most amazing part, you need to use so little that it will last you forever. I marked the date on the bottom of the bottle and I began using it December 24, 2010 and it's now October 7, 2012 and I still have another few weeks of use left in it. For reference, I shave 2-3 times a week and have a thick beard. I shave with a double edge safety razor and a badger brush, so all I need is a finger tip size dab, work it into a nice lather and I'm good to go. Like I said before, nearly two years later and I'm using the same bottle!!!On top of all that, it leaves my skin feeling great and with no more irritation. Buy this! You'll love it!
