review/text: Nothing can replace a skilled Soma practitioner - but this thing rocks. I've had a bad back (herniated discs) for years. The discs are fine now, but the muscle over-compensation in my back is near-constant if I'm active with basketball, golf, yardwork, etc. In lieu of massage-on-call, this chair is a great addition to begin an energetic morning with loosening and close the day with a relaxing post-yardwork massage.Head's up - if you have the lower-body (legs) setting on high, don't panic...it will let up eventually. I personally like the rough stuff, so that's where I keep it.
