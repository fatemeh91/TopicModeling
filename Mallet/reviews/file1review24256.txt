review/text: I heard about WalkFit from a freind.I had 2 different inserts from my doctor and was not getting relief for my plantar fascitis. My heel pain lingered for five months. I started using WalkFit and at first was they were uncomfortable. I didn't give up and worked my way up to the firm insert. I had some therapy and also used an arch support strap and after 4 weeks, I finally have no heel pain.I ordered another pair and have them in my golf shoes and in my sneakers.
