review/text: I starting noticing greater hair growth about two weeks into taking this liquid vitamin. Now I have to also include the fact that I take a Hair, nails, and skin vitamin as well. Before taking this liquid vitamin, i noticed hair growth but this has added to it. I gained 3/4-11/4 in hair growth (all areas in my head of hair does not grow equally). I have since purchased my 2nd bottle of liquid vitamin. I do have to report that initially at first I did experience what felt like bloat and gas, but that passed (figuratively speaking). I no longer experience any side effects. I would recommend this product to be taken for health and for the those ladies out there entering into hair growth challenges.
