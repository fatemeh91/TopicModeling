review/text: The image of the product leads you to believe that this is the original thermophore brand heating pack in the red box. It even says "red box" at the end of the description. however when the product arrived in the mail, it was in a white box and said it is made by a company called battlecreek. This product is not anywhere near the quality of the original thermophore heating packs. The product was extremely misrepresented. The only positive thing i have to say is that i returned the product and was given a full refund without any problems.
