review/text: One is first attracted to this product because of the cheaper price but what you get, unsurprisingly, is a cheaper product.If you don't mix it in a blender you are left with a clumpy mess. Mixing it with anything but milk would be a horrible idea, mixing it with water is nearly impossible. I will never buy this product again and hate to throw it away but it is a grade D product with its only redeemable part of it being the taste is not half bad.
