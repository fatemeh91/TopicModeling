review/text: Yum! I am a ginger fan, and The Ginger People have yet to disappoint with their products. It's great that Amazon is offering these now, so that I can restock my desk without battling traffic to get to a specialty store. These flavorful hard candies are a great afternoon pick-me-up that satisfy my need to nosh with a single candy - better than the super sugary candies that make you want chew through a whole bag. Also, the individual packaging is convenient for slipping one into my pocket for a long meeting!
