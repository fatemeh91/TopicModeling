review/text: I bought this product hoping to get the Flake that is made in England, apparently after I got it I find out that the box is identical to the one we have in our country which is the one made in Ireland, and believe me it's not the as good. it's made for export to multi regions that's why it has multi languages and a big Flake title in Arabic on the box.I paid $26 plus $30 shipping for an item that I could've got from a near store for less than $10
