review/text: My chiropractor told me to start taking the alfajuice capsules. One thing I know is that it helps to keep your system quite regular!! I am currenetly taking 1 a day. At one point I was taking one with breakfast lunch and dinner and it made my bowels a little tooooo loose! ( I think this is a fantastic supplement for constipation. I have recommended it to several people and it has helped them quite a bit!!!)
