review/text: I have been using this product for three years. I went to an orthopedic surgeon who wanted to do reconstructive surgery on my knee so I got a second opinion. The second doctor told me to try Cosamin DS since he did not feel that surgery was needed. I have very little pain in my knee and I work out three days a week with no pain.
