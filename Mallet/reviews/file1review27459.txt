review/text: I have gone through this product 4 times now, and I must say that I have only tried two flavors: Double Rich Chocolate and Rocky Road. Rocky Road tastes mega sweet and has a sickening sweet smell.On the other hand the chocolate one is by far the best protein shake flavor I have had. I highly suggest trying out several flavors to determine what you like before ordering a larger size to avoid the mistake that I had made.
