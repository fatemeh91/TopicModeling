review/text: I use this item to hold multiple scissors, needle drivers and reflex hammer in the pocket of my white clinical lab jacket--works great! No more holes torn out in the pocket and all items transfer out of my coat into book bag or locker quickly and easily. Highly recommend, very sturdy build quality!
