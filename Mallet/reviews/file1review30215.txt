review/text: If all your jobs can be done with the attachments in the advertisement you are good to go.Every item Shown in the AD works really well. I purchased the VAC. thinking i would buy some attachments for cleaning computers and blinds later,NOT going to happen. The hose end is flat and all brush attachments are round, so you are limited to jobs you are able to perform.
