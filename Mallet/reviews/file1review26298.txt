review/text: They were passing out samples of these the other day and so I took one and brought it home to try.It looks like a bar cookie, browned on one side, and smells sweet and fruity. It tastes a little bit like a cross between a cookie and bread pudding with coconut flavor while the papaya, mango and pineapple combine to taste just about like dried apricot to me. The flavor combination is not bad at all. I wouldn't guess that it had soy in it instead of another type of flour and the texture isn't bad, just the right amount of chewiness.However, the bar is fairly small and a little dry so I probably won't be buying any. People who like this sort of snack or have some special reason to choose them like avoiding wheat products will probably enjoy them. If I were offered other flavors to try I would taste them so my rating is neutral.
