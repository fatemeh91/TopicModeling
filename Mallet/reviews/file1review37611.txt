review/text: Sure Clear Dry is everything it claims to be and more. It goes on clear and dries fast without being sticky like most gels. This unscented formula smells nice, not ""mediciney"" like some I have tried. Being in my mid-forties I'm conscious of my body changing and having to try new things when products I'm used to become ineffective. One day this last week I felt so ill I just rested to get better and skipped my ""shower and Sure""... and no odor problem! Save money and switch to Sure.
