review/text: Perfect traveling trimmer. I have a full beard and mustache, and couldn't be happier with this. It doesn't have a base, just plug charger into the bottom end, which makes this ideal for taking on the road.Update a year later. This thing is still the best trimmer I have ever purchased. I don't even bother with my $100 setup. Holds a charge well, and the guard never slips.
