review/text: I have used many brands of HCL as I have to take it prior to eating in order to avoid severe stomach pain. I picked up the Solaray recently when my go-to brand was out of stock. While it does work (it is HCL, after all) you don't get much bang for your buck. While I only take 2 pills of my go-to brand before each meal, I had to take at least 5 Solaray capsules to get similar results. It would probably be a good choice if you need a low dosage of HCL, but if you are like me and need around 1200mg with each meal, this is not the economical choice.
