review/text: Well I didn't have the miracle experience like the other ones. I don't think you can expect incredible gains from any supplements. It does help, its better than nothing. Convenient way to get enough protein in. I don't think its something any other protein product can't do. I bought vanilla, I have tasted strawberry seemed pretty good. Vanilla really isnt that bad either. I did get sick of the taste where i despised taking it after abouta month. After a short break it didnt bother me anymore. The container says you gain 8lbs of lean mass in 6 weeks compared to 4 from other products. I doubt it works twice as well as other products. 8lbs is a lot for a 6 weeks, we would all look like body builders if this stuff worked that effective for most people. I say give it a shot if you'r not worried about price, but personally I would look for a cheaper alternative.
