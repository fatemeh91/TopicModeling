review/text: Let's face it: shaving stinks. It is tedious, expensive, time-consuming, and potentially hazardous to your health (nicks are the WORST)! The Intuition razor doesn't totally alleviate any of these problems--it plainly makes the second one worse--but the more you use it, the less bothersome shaving becomes.I've heard a lot of complaints about this product, and they aren't without merit. The one about the cartridge wearing down too quickly is the most deserved. However, the maximum benefits of this razor can only be realized once you've toyed around with it a bit in order to master your technique. How do you make the cartridge last longer? By shaving faster, and avoiding re-shaving areas you've already covered. How do you avoid nicks? By keeping in mind that the little soap pillow around the razor does NOT give you added protection (it took me a couple really painful tries to catch on to this!). Just try this razor out, get a little practice with it, and you'll probably find you prefer it in the long run.I became addicted to this razor over the past year at college, where there weren't any bathtubs, and the showers weren't large enough to find that necessary dry area in which to put your shaving-cream-covered leg as you awkwardly attempt to rinse off your razor without falling over! The classic bic + colgate cream formula did NOT work for me in this environment. So I turned to the Intuition, and once I learned how to use it properly, shaving became a TON easier.Yeah, I feel a little cheated by the price. That's why I'm starting to buy in bulk through Amazon. It's a bit cheaper than the drugstore, at least.
