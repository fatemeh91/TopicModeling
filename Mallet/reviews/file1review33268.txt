review/text: I bought this as a gift for my father, who has severe tension in his shoulders. It's something he never would have thought to buy for himself, but he loves it now. He just pops it in the microwave for about 2 1/2 minutes, and puts it around his shoulders while he watches TV or works at his desk.
