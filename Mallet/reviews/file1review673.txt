review/text: I try new energy/protein bars for variety and to see if I'm missing out on something. The Zoe bars are a major disappointment. The roof of my mouth feels like it is coated with a grainy wax when I finish eating the bars. Unless you enjoy wax, spend your money on many good alternative bars and skip the Zoe's.
