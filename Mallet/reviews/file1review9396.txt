review/text: I purchased two of these to use for a complicated regiment of antibiotics for my very large dog. The container with am/pm sides allows for 12 hour pill schedules and the compartments are quite large and held all of the big chewable tablets. Since the each day is an individual container, it was easy to rearrange the two-week regimen based on the day the medication starts and then keep moving the days forward as pills are dispensed. The lids stay closed very firmly and the interior divider between am/pm keeps even the smallest pills from slipping to the wrong side. This was fantastic for my purposes and is very easy to travel with.
