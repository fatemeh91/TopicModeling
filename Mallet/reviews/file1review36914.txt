review/text: I really like the perfect size of the Glide Floss container. It fits right into my palm and is so easy to use. The dental floss itself is one of the hardiest flosses I have ever used. It did not shred and does glide right in between your teeth. It does a good job grabbing food particles as well. The floss is thin and flat so it has a tendency to fold over at times, causing sensitivity to my teeth due to its thickness. Thinner floss would be perfect for my crowded teeth.
