review/text: I'm a 44 year old man, no family history of heart disease, "normal" blood pressure, slightly elevated cholesterol, exercise 3-4 times per week--frankly, I expect my heart will never need to be defibrillated. But then again, who does?I bough mine to protect myself, my family and friends--even my neighbors. This device is truely amazing. It really, really is as easy to use as a doorbell. If a shock is needed, you push a flashing button after the devices tells you to do so. The HeartStart does all the thinking. Its voice is remarkably reasuring. The instructions are simple and clear.Given the thought of needing one and not having it--cost really wasn't much of a consideration. Each time I pass it, (we keep ours in the laundry room) I'm reminded just how precious life is.I highly recommend this product and congradulate Philips for its pioneering work in this area.
