review/text: One of the drawbacks was that it is to large to be used in the seated position.Instructions state not to bend the product so it can only be used while laying down.Also the manual switch is very inconvienient.After releasing the switch the heat goes away fast and you must then repeat the holding of the manual switch. Not worth it for the cost and time involved.
