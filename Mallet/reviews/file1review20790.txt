review/text: Here's my scoop. I have had a number of different shavers over the past 25 years. I used to prefer Norelco rotary shavers until I found this Braun 8585 shaver. First of all and most importantly it gives a great, clean, close and comfortable shave. Second it's easy to maintain. Just pop it in to the base, press one button and all the cleaning is done for you. Replacement cleaning cartridges are needed every two months or so but they're well worth the price for a shaver that is clean and causes no (and I mean no) irritation. Third it can be used either with the cord or without the power cord. The sideburn trimmer, contrary to other reviews, is actually very easy to use. The lockable pivoting head puts the cutter block and foil directly where they need to be for the best shave possible. The 8595 shaver has an LED display which indicates the charge level, but honestly this seemed somewhat superfluous since most guys don't shave for hours on end without putting the shaver back into the recharging unit and even if you did go for hours on end you could still use the power cord. So if you want the best shaver and the best shave possible, go with the 8585 Braun Activator shaver!
