review/text: I have used DGL throughout the years with great success. DGL is a wonderful remedy for acid problems with the stomach. I purchased this brand of DGL thinking all DGL products are the same. So I did not read the ingredients. But Planetary Herbals puts orange flavoring into their formula of DGL. Which makes the taste absolutely horrible. I chewed one tablet and just about lost my cookies. I've never tasted anything so awful. Licorice and orange flavors do not go well together. So this bottle of DGL went into the trash. Now I know to read the label of each brand of DGL.
