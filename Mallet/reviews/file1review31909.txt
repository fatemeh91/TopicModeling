review/text: I find this digestive formula helpful when I have consumed a heavier meal that consists of fish or grains/starches. I don't do dairy so I don't know how well it works with lactose. I am gluten-intelorent and am suspicious of the barley grass - I feel like it builds up in my system if I take this enzyme daily and causes some mild distress in my small intestine. I don't know much about the science of grains/grasses and gluten but trust that subtle symptoms from my gut mean I need to watch more closely what I am taking in - even a potentially gluten-free enzyme blend. Next time I will purchase a formula that does not contain any grain-grasses, if possible.
