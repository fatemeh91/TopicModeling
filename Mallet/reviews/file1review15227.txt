review/text: These are great. I have eaten them for several years. Sometimes for a quick breakfast or for a snack in between meals. Now I am trying to lose a few pounds and I find them to be a great snack to have when you want something a little sweet. They really curb your appetite. They are good. The honey yogurt is my all time favorite!
