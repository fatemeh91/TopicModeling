review/text: I wore the Baurfeind Malleo ankle support for three weeks after coming out of an air cast. I'm finally recovered from a bad peroneal tendon sprain. I'm a runner. I wore this ankle support during those first weeks back on the treadmill and on the road. Thanks to the Amazon reviews; I feel like I made the best choice. This ankle support is made of excellent material. It is very fine quality. It's beautifully woven. Stands up to washing. It ended up in the dryer, still came out fine. (I don't suggest putting it in the dryer) Overall, I'm impressed. The gel fit right around my peroneal tendon. It protected it in a way that allowed me to wear my sneakers/shoes without aggravating the tendon. The compression was just right. It wasn't too tight. The top of my ankle measures just under 8.5, so I ordered the III. They were out of the black, so I got the blue colored featured. I would have preferred the low-key black, however the blue is muted enough.
