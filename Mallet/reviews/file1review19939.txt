review/text: I never, ever write reviews so go figure my first is about a potty seat! This thing is awesome - it fits both our round and elongated bowls, and also fits public restroom seats (which can be kind of scary to a little toddler learning to use the potty). I took the advice of a previous reviewer and just throw this seat in 2 plastic shopping bags when we go out - it fits right under the stroller and it makes life just a little bit easier for moms and toddlers on the go. Another thing I do is hang it on the little hook we have on our toilet tank - it came with the Scrubbing Bubbles toilet cleaning wand I bought years ago but stashed under the sink once our son started crawling. It's so perfect - you could also get one of those plastic hooks w/ the sticky back and put it on the side of the tank. The rubber ring around the base (the black part) really does keep liquids from seeping out. It's also very easy to clean - not many nooks & crannies for stuff to get stuck in. I wouldn't change a thing about this - definitely worth the money!!
