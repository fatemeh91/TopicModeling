review/text: After my back surgery I am not able to twist and do the wiping the old fashioned way. I learned about this tool in the rehabilitation facility, so to get it right away I had someone purchase it at local Medical Supply store for 2 times as much as Amazon. I wish knew about this tool earlier so I could have bought prior to surgery.No, it does not work as well as doing it with a hand, but it sure beats asking someone else to do it for you.You will have to experiment with various techniques to find what works best for you, prepare to use a lot more toilet paper, many many swipes, and sometimes get your hands dirty. But it does the job.Updated a week later:I decided to buy a second toilet aid so I would have one in each bathroom. I purchasedIdeaworks Long Reach Comfort Wipeand it works much better! It grips the paper better then Self-Wipe, the rubbery head (rather than smooth plastic of Self-Wipe) gives you a better wipe, it uses less toilet paper, you never get your hands dirty because of how the ejection button works.Long Reach is a simpler, cheaper alternative, that is engineered better! Based on the comparison with the other product I am reducing the stars for Self_Wipe from 4 to 3.
