review/text: I was a little hesitant in taking this herb because of the black cohosh but I took it at the dose on the bottle starting 5 weeks before my due date. I also started using EPO on the cervix at 37 weeks and switched to borage oil at 38 weeks. I also drank RRL tea starting at 36 weeks. I had my son at 38 weeks and 5 days. I had been feeling "pre-labor" contractions for about two days prior to actually going into labor. I woke up at 130am with regular, somewhat painful contractions about 5 min apart. We got to the hospital at 3am and I was 5cm. (I was 2-3 cm at 38 week appt.) I had a spinal at 5am when I was 7cm. I had another spinal at 730am at 8cm. My son was born at 9am after only 1/2 hour pushing, 7lbs 2oz. The baby was 100% healthy and I felt really great almost immediately. I had almost no swelling or pain in the peri area although I did need 2 stitches. I left the hospital 25 hours later. (I would have felt good to leave the same day but needed to stay for the circumcision and some other baby tests.)Just as a comparison with my first delivery I did not use 5-w but I used EPO on the cervix at 37 weeks. I was 2 cm at my 37 week appt. My water broke at 37 weeks 4 days at 2am. By 5pm I had to be induced with pitocin because contractions had not started on their own. By 3cm I needed pain relief. I got a spinal/epidural combo. At 8am the next morning I was 10 cm. I pushed for 1 hour 45min and it was extremely painful and difficult. I did need some supplementary oxygen while pushing. Baby was born healthy with a very cone shaped head, 6lbs 15oz.I don't know exactly how much the 5w affected the birth or if it would have gone that well otherwise, but I was so pleased with the whole experience I will definately be using it next time.
