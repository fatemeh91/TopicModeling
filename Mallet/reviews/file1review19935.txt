review/text: I was hesitant to buy this product because I felt like it was a little pricey, but now I feel like it was worth the money. We will be able to use it for all of our children no matter where we move and what sized toilet we have. It has a really secure fit as well, so it won't give kids a fear of falling in. It's worth a little more money in my opinion.
