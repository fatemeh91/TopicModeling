review/text: Do they work? Yes, they do. But getting them down is not an experience I'd recommend. I normally have very little trouble with pills in general--even calcium pills which (up to now) were the biggest and hardest pills I'd had to deal with. These are much larger: more than 3/4" long, more than 1/4" high (domed on both sides) and more than 1/4" across. When they get stuck, it really hurts. I'm not repeating this purchase. I'm going to buy lower potency pills and take whatever number I need to take to add up to 750mg dosage I've been recommended.
