review/text: It's hard to give any over the counter supplement aimed at muscle building a true 5 star rating as none of them really work that well, but of the available supplements, this is definitely a good one. I do feel increased strength from it, it's a bit pricey for a relatively small container, I have found it to be effective at half a scoop before my workout. It doesn't mix well with a spoon, there's some white bits of stuff that floats on the top, but hey, many bodybuilding supplements are like that, I never tried putting it in a blender, I just drink it as is and sometimes I mix it with a creatine product which enhances it's a effects a little bit. One reviewer said the taste was so bad that he threw it away, I didn't find the taste to be so bad. It certainly doesn't taste good, but I couldn't imagine not taking any because of the taste, much less throwing it away. Bad tasting supplements comes with the territory for bodybuilding to some extent and I didn't find the taste to be that bad anyhow. This is a bodybuilding supplement, keep that in mind, if your goal is to simply remain healthy, you don't need this stuff, but if your goal is to add muscle mass then this can give you a slight boost, which is saying a heck of a lot by the standards of over the counter supplements.
