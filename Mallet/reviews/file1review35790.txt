review/text: I tried these gas relief drops on my son numerous times. These did absolutely nothing for his gas-except when he'd swollow them he'd not scream for maybe a couple seconds.The pediatrician also mentioned that there have been no studies on these types of products that prove they even do anything for babies. Sometimes it will work, but if you don't see a significant difference you should stop using them all together.
