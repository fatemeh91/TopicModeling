review/text: I have always felt that OXO is hit and miss with quality. I have tried several of their kitchen brushes over the years and this one is pretty good. It has a strong handle and I suspect it will last more than 6 months. At the same time, I'll probably replace it before then for cleanliness purposes, since the head isn't replaceable. Regardless, it's cheap and does the trick. Good for general cleaning of dishes, etc, but not for the true elbow grease stuff.
