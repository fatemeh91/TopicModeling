review/text: Both my mom and dad grew up poor and had problems with their teeth and gums, so when they started making good money, they impressed upon me the importance of taking care of my teeth. Because of this, I've always made flossing a priority, but to be honest, I find it takes a lot of time and isn't really efficient, so I keep looking for alternatives. Over the years I've tried flossing handles, individual floss picks, etc., but never found anything that was an improvement or worked even as well as regular flossing. Until now. Based on an online review I picked up a box of these Brush Picks. I've been using them for a month, and I can say that I don't think I'll ever go back to regular floss. Not only is it easier to care for my teeth with these picks, I think they actually do a better job than floss.
