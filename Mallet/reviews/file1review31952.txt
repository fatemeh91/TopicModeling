review/text: This product along with other garden of life products has been life changing. My son was diagnosed with mild to moderate autism at 2. He is 6 and lost his diagnosis at 5. With the onslaught of problems he had as a toddler, the super green food formula helped tremendously!!!!! We began to have hope and now several years later we still use this product as our &#34;maintenance protocol&#34;. We use the powder form and put it in baby food organic green beans and call it his green food- he once said mom, that's baby food and I'm a big boy now, but when I disregard that it's baby food and get creative, lol, he doesn't care anymore and takes it on a regular basis. Some day I will meet Jordin Ruben and thank him for giving our son, his life back....it was so hard seeing him deal with bouts of diarrhea and throwing up and the cognitive issues etc etc- I meet families all the time that tend to keep using products that don't offer any positive results for their child, so they give up - or they don't even look at garden of life products because it doesn't fit in with the 'autism biomedical criteria', but I will advocate for what works! These kids have a chance with garden of life! I'm so thankful I took a chance and tried these products!! It was not overnight, but we saw results within a month. Try it!
