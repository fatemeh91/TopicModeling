review/text: I've always used the beard/sideburn trimmer on my Braun electric shaver, but I received the Panasonic beard and moustache trimmer as a Christmas gift. I have to say that it is much simpler to use for this specialized purpose.With an electric shaver, I always had to be careful about getting too close to a beard, or else I would create a nice bald spot for a few days. This meant trimming the beard after a morning coffee to be more awake... The guard on the Panasonic makes this task much more of a no-brainer. I can set it to the optimal hair length, and just run it across my beard and moustache to get a nice even look. The rechargeable battery seems to last pretty long as well.On travel, I'll probably stick with my electric shaver, as I don't want to lug around two shaving appliances. That gets to the only real caveat about a product like this. A beard/moustache trimmer will never take the place of an electric shaver, but for its specialized purpose, the Panasonic works quite well.
