review/text: I have finished half of a 720 grams (25,4 oz.) jar and noticed that this product (version 10.1) has 16.4 mg. of iron per serving. In my opinion, this is far too much iron for an adult male. I dumped the remainder on my compost pile. I understand they may have reduced the iron level in the newer version??
