review/text: Ladies and Gentlemen! Don't waste your money on waxing, Nair or other methods of grooming Brazilian or Manscapeing. This is America's best kept secret. No pain, no rash and easy enough in the shower. Women, I am surprised to find out, are still using cheap throwaway razors and getting lousy results, such as razor bumps, rash and occasional cuts (ooh oow). I have introduced this system, sometimes being fought all the way, but loved after a couple of missed brazilian wax appointments. Great for bikini wax as well as manscaping the area where few women ever tread. By the way guys, they love it down there once the brush has been cut.
