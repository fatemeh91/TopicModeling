review/text: I purchased this massage oil from Amazon. We have been greatly pleased by the Lavendar scent. The scent is not so overpowering you need to air out the house after using it, but does leave a nice lavender smell in the room. I am also very please that this massage oil easily washs off with soap and hot water, and does not leave an oily residue. I little goes a long way and a 16oz container will last for some time while still holding its scent. Another feature I appreciate is this product is shipped in a durable container. I have accidently knocked this container off the shelf, it has fallen from a height of about 5 feet and hit the tile floor without breaking, cracking or the cap coming off. I highly recommend this product to those individuals that enjoy Lavender scent.
