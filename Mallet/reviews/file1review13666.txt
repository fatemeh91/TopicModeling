review/text: My wife and I moved to Mexico five years ago. Where we now reside is very dusty and gritty. Although we own and use a floor machine on the tile floors, in both the casa and casita, this O Cedar Floor N More washable mop-head is the perfect solution for hard floors between machine cleanings. It has a large surface contact with the floor and is easy to guide around furniture, collecting the daily dust and grit. After dry dusting, we use a spray bottle containing an amonia dilution to moisten floors, and use the same terry cloth head to clean. Although it cannot reach down into grout joints like the machine, it leaves the floors spotless. Much better than conventional dry dust mops, and worlds better than the wet string mop. Keep six in the pantry, use them, then throw them in the wash with other dust rags and mop-head oovers. Great product.
