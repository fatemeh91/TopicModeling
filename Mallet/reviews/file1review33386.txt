review/text: A common misconception is that there is a "best" type of razor blade. In fact, blade preference is highly personal. The "best" blade is the one that gives you the best shave, regardless of what anyone else says. I like these blades. I find them sharp without being overly aggressive. They also hold an edge well without dulling quickly.I would recommend these to anyone searching for the perfect blade. These blades are generally considered above-average quality. They are sharp, but not the sharpest or most aggressive blade available, falling right in that range where most people like them a lot. I can't promise they'll be the best blade for you, but I do suggest you give them a shot and see how they work for you.
