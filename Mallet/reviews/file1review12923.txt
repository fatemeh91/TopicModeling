review/text: I bought two of these (just in case of overnight wetness) for my 2-year-old, and they work superbly!! My li'l guy is quite a wiggle-worm at night, but the sheet doesn't move or bunch up at all! It's plenty big enough (he sleeps on a regular-sized twin bed) to take up all the space he rolls around on, and I never worry about him wetting it so much it would leak (one, because it doesn't, and two, because he goes potty before bed). I absolutely recommend this product to anyone!!
