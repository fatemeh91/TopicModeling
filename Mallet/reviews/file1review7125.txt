review/text: I purchased this item based off of the reviews and the affordable price. I have been using a gillette razor and the andis styliner 2 for shaving my face and head. The razor tends to cause black heads and razor bumps and the styliner to me is more for touch up work than full shaves. While this whal product can't cut nearly as close as a razor, it did a good job. It did leave serveral loose hair spots on my face so I touched it up with the edger that is attached to the shaver. That combo worked well. I had a very close shave. I would reccomend this product for those of you whose skin does not respond well to a true razor shave. I follow up my shaves with the bump patrol facial application and I don't get any bumps. I also reccomend in addtion to the bump patrol you have the skin tone application by high time, to help lighten up any shaving blemishes you occur.
