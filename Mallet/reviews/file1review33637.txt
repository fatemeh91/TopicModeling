review/text: We've used this model in the past and it started to get very very loud. We thought because it was old. So we took another stab and bought a new one, exact same problem. It was extremely loud that my neighbor would hear it. The hose was shaking vigorously. Without trying a second time, I returned it to the store the next day.
