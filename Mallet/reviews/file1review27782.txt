review/text: I moved from drinking "Pure Protein" to "Optimum Nutrition" because of its lesser cholesterol. Pure Protein had 80mg of cholesterol as opposed to Optimums 30mg of cholesterol. The lesser the cholesterol, the better for me!! If there's another protein shake with less than 30mg of cholesterol drop me a message. Otherwise, I'm liking this stuff. So far no bad aftertaste. Blends well. Nothing bad to say.
