review/text: This brush is considerably larger than a toothbrush and grips well in the hand. They call it a "a grout brush"; not for brushing freshly poured grout (cement), but for brushing in grout joints between tiles.I tried the brush in the shower using CLR liquid cleaner and the brush does a fine job of getting the CLR cleaner deep into the joints and the calcium, lime and mold deposits out. Also brushed the shower head several times and let the solution stand. Very satisfied about the results. Because of its narrow brushing head, the brush does well in the commode under the outer lip where fresh water enters and also down deep in the narrows of the commode.I also use this brush to brush the hardware fittings on my boat that have rusted. It works well.The brush is unlike any brush I have ever seen in the brick and mortar stores.When this one wears out, I will reorder another.
