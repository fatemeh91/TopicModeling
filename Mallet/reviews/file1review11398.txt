review/text: I had been waking up every morning with a headache and had tried everything. One day I came accross the reviews for Sleep Right and thought why not. I had tried the boil type with no luck but this one has been great. I can sleep all night and I don't even realize that it is there. It hasn't completely stopped but the headaches but they are rare now. I have had mine for about six months and will soon replace it with the same product.
