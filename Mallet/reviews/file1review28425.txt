review/text: I HAD HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT THIS PRODUCT THAT I JUST WANTED TO BUY IT, SEE THAT IT TASTED LIKE CRAP LIKE THE OTHER "HYPED" PROTEIN PRODUCTS, AND WRITE A BAD REVIEW, BOY, WAS I SURPRISED, NOT ONLY WAS THE TASTE BEARABLE BUT IT WAS SURPRISINGLY GOOD, I COULD REALLY DRINK THIS STUFF EVERY DAY, (I HAVE FOR THE LAST 30 DAYS AND STILL LOVE THE TASTE), THIS COMPANY HAS FINALLY DEVELOPED A PROTEIN PRODUCT THAT YOU CAN DRINK WITHOUT GAGGING. I MAKE A GALLON OF IT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WEEK AND DRINK IT AS A IN BETWEEN SNACK AS WELL AS BEFORE AND AFTER WORKOUTS, I LOVE TO PUT IT IN MY CEREAL. I ONLY DRINK SOY MILK ANYWAY WHICH HAS 6 GRAMS OF PROTEIN ANYWAY SO ALONG WITH GOLD STANDARD I AM DRINKING ABOUT 35 TO 40 GRAMS OF PROTEIN AT A TIME, CANT SAY ENOUGH GOOD ABOUT THIS STUFF, WILL BE BUYING MORE.........
