review/text: These vitamins really give me a boost of energy and I can tell a difference if I miss taking them for a day or two. I have also noticed an improvement in my skin and hair. These vitamins are so much better than the Centrum type of daily vitamins because they really do work, they supply more than just the 100% of RDA and they include a guarantee on their products. I highly recommend these!
