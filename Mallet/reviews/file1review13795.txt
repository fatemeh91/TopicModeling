review/text: This neck wrap is great. The shape is what I like the most about it. It sits comfortably on the shoulders and actually provides warmth to those areas. I've used the long skinny heat wraps in the past and they aren't thick enough - they just dangle at the front. The "C" shape of this one is nearly perfect.I microwave mine for 2 1/2 minutes. I threw away the little scented pouch - it's overpowering and not my kind of scent.-1 star because some of the filling has come out of the interior pouch but it stays in the outer cover. I've only had it for a week. I'll repair it when I wash the cover. 'til then, it's no big deal.
