review/text: I have been using the celery seed extract for about a year now... at my last blood work the doc congratulated me on my good health and keeping my blood sugar under control and almost in the normal range now. My good cholesteral had escalated and my bad cholesteral had decreased. The doc told me to keep doing what I was doing. The only thing that I had done different this past year, was to add the Celery Seed Extract to my diet... so I am still taking it and will do so on a daily bases.
