review/text: I've had the rollator for several weeks and absolutely love it. It has met all my expectations and more, with the large wheels easily traversing over all types of terrain. The one thing I didn't expect is the feeling that this is "sporty" and different, most machines of this type give the impression of being staid. It actually is very stylish and modern, with the ergonomics and attention to detail more obvious as you use it. "It's "great".
