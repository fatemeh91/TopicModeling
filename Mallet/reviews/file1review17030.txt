review/text: I am more than satisfied with my purchase. I bought the trimmer because I saw it was on sale at the time and had been looker for one. I was a little reluctant at first but four stars isn't bad. Some of the poor ratings for not having this such as a stand are unfair complaints since you didn't purchase an expensive trimmer with a stand. It does everything its supposed to and works great.After a few months of use, my trimmer stopped working. I contacted customer service. Within 24 hrs I had a reply with simple detailed instructions on getting a replacement. Shipped it out next day. In less than two weeks time I had my replacement trimmer. Awesome support from Remington.
