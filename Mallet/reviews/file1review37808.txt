review/text: This product is really appropriate only for facial hair. It will not give a shave or trim that is remotely close to the skin. It will not trim shorter than about a 1/4 inch. In addition, the charge does not hold for very long. It remains charged for about 5mins. so you have to work quickly. However, you will get longer than 5 mins. of use if you used it while it remains plugged into an outlet. I would recommend it strictly as a grooming tool for facial hair.
