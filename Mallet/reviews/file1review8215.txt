review/text: I bought this OXO brush to clean out the glass pitcher I purchased to store milk. It has a comfortable, long handle, two types of bristles, and is large enough to get the hard to reach spot under the "shoulder" of the pitcher (that can sometimes be a drag). It works perfectly for what I needed it for, but I would imagine if you just needed a brush for mugs or glasses, the handle could be considered a little long. Works for us!
