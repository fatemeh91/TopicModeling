review/text: I had purchased the Bucky forty blinks mask for myself 6 months ago and loved it so much I bought this one for my husband. The mask is so light and comfortable. The mask does move a bit when sleeping because I have a small head and the mask does not really adjust small enough to fit secure (hence the 4 stars). Also if the room is bright (or you are in a car) there is a very very small amount of light that comes in from the bottom of the mask, but this is not a significant amount that prevents me from sleeping. Although it makes me look like a bug, I still wear the mask in long car trips when traveling because it works so well and is easy to stash.
