review/text: I have bought several pocket ashtrays for different reasons (1 looks like a dice). This has to be the best one. You can fit about 3 butts in it (4 if you squish it in) and the others seem to be smaller. Just put the butt in and close it! Put it back in your pocket or purse and empty it next time you can. I would recommend this one over the rest. Zippo makes good products!
