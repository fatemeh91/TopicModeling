review/text: Was advertised as being double rich chocolate. Taste is bland with light chocolate flavor, nothing Rich about it or double either tastes alright blended with 1/2 banana or with strawberries yummy in that case, probably would not buy if I tasted it first. I had a different product that I mixed in my morning coffee and it was great. This one clumps up if mixed in a warm beverage.
