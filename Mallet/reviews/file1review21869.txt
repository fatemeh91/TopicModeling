review/text: This product is ok, however there are a few things I didn't like about it:1. The ice pockets are so small that they warm up easily after being put in the fridge (as suggested by product pamphlet).2. If you do freeze it to avoid that first problem, the sleeve is very inflexible and consequently incredibly difficult to put on.3. I felt that it was smaller than listed on the site. I'd go a size up and if it's too big, you can always still use it lying down or duct tape it to fit better. I can't really use mine!
