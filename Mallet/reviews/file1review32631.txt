review/text: I have tried the whole line of Probars and, at first, I was put off by the amount of fat. Then I looked at the source of the fat - nuts, peanut butter, etc. and everything else they offer - all organic and unprocessed ingredients, 6g of fiber, Omega 3s and 6s, 3oz of good, filling and healthy stuff and instantly got over the "fat issue". This flavor, in particular, is more zingy and fruity. YUM!
