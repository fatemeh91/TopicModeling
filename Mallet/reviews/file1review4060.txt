review/text: I bought the Fusion Power because I am a huge Federer fan and he endorsed this product so I thought why the heck not!! I have a pretty sensitive skin and I thought that this product would work out great for me. I was right. I absolutely loved the product which is why I ordered this replacement cartridges pack from amazon. For some reason though, these blades feel different, and not in a good way. Compared to the blade that came with the razor, these blades are really bad. I still found a way to make these blades work slightly better for me, but I was and am really disappointed. Maybe I got the bad ones or something, but do not buy this pack expecting it to work the same way as the one that came with the razor.....
