review/text: I bought this vibe about a month ago. IT is Fantastic! the best $20 I have ever spent, worth 2x the price.-Yes, it smells like plastic, I dont know why people are turned off by that. Its a vibe...made out of plastic.--The vibration is great, the perfect amount. there are two buttons, one controls the bunny ears the other controls the rotation of the shaft. Personally, I dont use the rotation often but the bunny ears bullet is wonderful. They do not irritate me however, I can see why some would complain if they have very sensitive skin.came in working order, and have had no problems since.takes 3 AA batsI recommend to all my friends!
