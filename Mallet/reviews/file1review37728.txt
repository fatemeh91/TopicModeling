review/text: This product worked great on legs and arms. It takes off all the hair in one application and really does leave your skin very soft and moisturized without the very strong smells that I remember from earlier products. When I used it on my upper lip, it was very irritating -- leaving my skin red for several hours and actually causing little blisters on the top border of my lip. It's possible I left it on a bit longer that the minimum four minutes they recommend, or that I may be more sensitive than the average person, but I certainly didn't leave it on longer than the 10 minutes that the product packaging recommends. I'll use this product again because for certain areas it did a fabulous job... but I'll certainly be cautious about using it on the more sensitive areas of my body again.
