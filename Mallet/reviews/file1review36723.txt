review/text: Awesome, great tasting vitamin C chewables! The berry tastes awesome & these are easy on the stomach.Vitamin C is essential to wound-hearing & prevention of long-term, chronic pain problems down the road. It can also help if you already have pain issues.IMHO, everyone who has had surgery or an injury to a limb, I'd take 3,000-5,000mg/day for roughly 6 weeks, then taper down to a regular every day dose. My chiropractor gave me an article from a chiropractic journal on the prevention of CRPS/RSD after surgery & injury to limbs, and a good vitamin C supplement reduces the chance by roughly 6-fold of developing RSD or CRPS.In addition, we all know that vitamin C has other antioxidant properties & thus health benefits.These taste like a tart candy (very much like sour sweet tarts!)For those who can't take citrus, yet need a vitamin C supplement, these are a great solution!For those of us who don't, they really taste great!
