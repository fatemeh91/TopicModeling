review/text: i have used this protein powder in the past because it was made from whey not soy. now soy is listed as well which, if not organic, is almost definitely genetically engineered-a cheap protein source. whey to go is not cheap and solgar should get rid of the GE soy and use only whey. in addition fructose is the second ingredient. i am now looking for a quality whey protein powder with less sugar.
