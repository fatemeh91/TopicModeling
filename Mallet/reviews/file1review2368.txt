review/text: Although I was skeptical about this product working, I've been suffering from burning and watering (literally tears pouring out!) eyes, particularly my right eye, for almost a year and was pretty desperate. My eye doctor said that I could try to use eye drops, but after using those for a few months, the problem wasn't any better. I actually stumbled across these capsules because my regular doctor had suggested I take a fish oil supplement for general health. When I saw that these were purported to help the eyes, I figured I'd give it a shot.Having read several reviews that said to give them time to work before dismissing them, I did just that. After about 6 weeks of taking the capsules regularly, I traveled out of state for a week. While there, it occurred to me that my eyes hadn't been bothering me, so I thought that perhaps it had been allergies after all. However, after returning home, the problem never returned, so I am certain that it was indeed these supplements that cured it. I'm actually pretty amazed but ever so thankful!I disagree with those who've said that the capsules leave a 'fishy' odor or taste. However, I'm not particularly 'gassy', so if you are a big burper, your experience might be different. I take the three capsules every morning when I wake up, and although fish oil capsules are on the large side and these are no different, it is absolutely worth it in terms of the difference I feel. Two thumbs waaaay up!
