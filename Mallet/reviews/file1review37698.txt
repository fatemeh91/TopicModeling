review/text: I found Mitchum Clear Gel Anti-Perspirant and Deodorant to be very effective at controlling both odor and wetness. This was the first time I'd used a gel instead of a solid, and I was very pleased with it. The super sport scent was also very nice. I'd recommend this item to friends and family.
