review/text: I will say up front I have never had this product BUT PLEASE CONTINUE TO READ. I have a subscrition to Consumer Report and this protein shake is one of the healthiest on the market. I (up till today) udes to love Muscle Milk. Did you know that Muscle Milk actually has traces of lead, mercury and high levels of arsnic in it?Noy only does Solgar not have lead, mercury, cadmium but it also has the lowest of the reveiwed in arsnic(0.6 micrograms).This is by far the healthiest that consumer reports revied and sent to a lab for observing. Lets just say I will be switching.
