review/text: My wife and I both started taking this stuff about 14 days ago. We both have more energy, sleep better, all around feel better. I have nasty allergies and my eyes would hurt all day long. I was an eye drop addict. After taking this stuff, I use my eye drops once a day. Gotta be the green stuff right?
