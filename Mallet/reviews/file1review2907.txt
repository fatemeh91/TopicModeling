review/text: I was taking these vitamins for 6 weeks and felt so great--got off my caffeine "addiction" with no headaches, just by starting these vitamins! I wish I had taken them back in the Fall before the rough winter--they gave me so much energy! Why I say "was" is because now I have to take Prenatal vitamins--which I'm really happy that MegaFood also has a Prenatal vitamin to take! I never get constipated or stomach problems with these--and I definitely have more energy since taking these.
