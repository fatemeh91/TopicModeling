review/text: The rollator might have been en excellent one, and was keenly waited for.However, 2 days past it's expected latest arrival time, it had not arrived. The company that was supposed to send it admitted that they had printed the shipping label, notified Amazon and us that it had been shipped, but had not done so.They offered a pink one which was absolutely not suitable for the male user, so I demanded the money back, which they promptly did. I was underwhelmed by the professionalism of that company, and notified Amazon.com about it.
