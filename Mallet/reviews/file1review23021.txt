review/text: I am 62 years old and live in the Desert Southwest. I have been an avid hiker my whole life, but had recently developed pain in both knees when attempting to jog or hike. I thought my days of outdoor physical activity were over, but a friend recommended knee supports. When I saw how highly these were rated on Amazon, I decided to give them a try and boy, am I ever glad I did. Knee pain is now a thing of the past, and hiking with these babies on is like having spring-loaded legs when I step out onto the trail. If anyone is having similar issues to what I went through,get on board with a pair of these; you won't be sorry.
