review/text: I bought this for my son after reading the great reviews. It is great! The only issue is that he had a hard time getting himself on it because the deflector shield is tall, however we started using it when he was 18 months and now he is a little over 2 and can get over it easier. He can pee and it all stays inside the toilet. We also have a oblong toilet seat and it fits snug. My son now knows how to put it on and off by himself. Great product!
