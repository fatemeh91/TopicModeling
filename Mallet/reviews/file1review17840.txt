review/text: This is Alka-Seltzer without the aspirin. It's perfect for heartburn, indigestion, or feeling too full. Why take a product with extra ingredients you don't need?? This is JUST FOR HEARTBURN. If you've got a headache or body aches, take regular alka seltzer, not this. But if you need relief of heartburn I highly recommend this product - I'm a registered nurse.
