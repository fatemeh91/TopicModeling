review/text: VERY POORLY CONSTRUCTED. While the mask is comfortable and blocks out all but a wee bit of light from the nose area, it is falling apart after only a few weeks of use. The inner liner (part that touches the face/eye area) is already separating from the mask. I would return it if I could, but I believe it's considered "used" (unreturnable) at this point. Also, thin strap means it slips off easily, competing (better) ones have a wide, sash-like strap.
