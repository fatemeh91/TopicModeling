review/text: Gillette sent me one as a promo. I tried it. Pros first. It does provide a close shave, with little irritation, even going against the grain. Cons: It is no better than a Sensor Excel, Mach 3, etc. Blades cost a FORTUNE (won't be buying any) and, regarding their claim that it will provide the closest shave ever- after shaving with it I stropped up (that is, sharpened) my straight razor, something I use perhaps once a year for kicks, and shaved with that. AFTER shaving with the fusion. Rather than rinse the lather off the razor, I wiped it on a white cloth. Results? LOTS of little bits of stubble the so called "advanced" Fusion left.Is it a good razor? Yes. Is it better than competitors? Not really. Is it worth the astronomical cost for replacement blades? No way!
