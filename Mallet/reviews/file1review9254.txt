review/text: I use these for travel and find them very helpful because they are clearly marked with the day of the week, are easy to open and close. They don't "lock" but if you travel with them in a small cosmetic case, I didn't seem to have a problem with them opening up at the wrong time. Actually bought a second set I liked them so much.
