review/text: My 63-year-old husband chronically got sick about once a month. As soon as he started feeling a little better, it would hit him again and he was miserable. Of course, many times he would pass the germs to me, too.On a recommendation from a friend, we both started taking Wellness. I admit I was VERY skeptical, but did it to appease my husband and our friend.After taking it regularly for about 3-4 months, my husband's health improved SIGNIFICANTLY! He had a new, stronger defense against all the bugs/germs. In the past several years, he has only had one very light cold; otherwise, he has been very healthy and full of energy.The only change we made was taking Wellness, so I have to say that Wellness was responsible for the improvement. We highly recommend the product, although some people may have allergies to some of the ingredients (we didn't experience this personally).
