review/text: I have used epilators for many years now. I started with the Epilady. When that finally died after years of use, I bought the Braun Silk Epil. I used that for many years as well. Recently, however, I accidently misplaced it. Although I was a totally satisfied Braun user, I wanted to shop around to see if there were other products out there that I might like better. I was impressed with the Emjoi and almost bought it until I spoke with two people who actually have used it. Both were long-time epilator users, and both were not that thrilled with it. The saying "If it ain't broken, don't fix it" came to mind, and I immediately went to the computer and ordered the Braun. Well I have to tell you that I absolutely love it! The improvements they have made over the years are wonderful, and I am completely satisfied. I highly recommend it.
