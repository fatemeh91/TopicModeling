review/text: I purchased this Medique #807M1 as a sturdier water and dust resistant replacement for a plastic first aid kit that had developed weakened/unreliable latches over the years. Keeping in mind that it's a large case, the metal is much heavier than the old plastic case. I immediately replaced some of the items included in the Medique kit with supplies from my old kit: The bandage scissors were very poor quality, and as another reviewer noted the tweezers were one time use plastic. I had enough extra room to add a small ace bandage, a roll of gauze, and extra adhesive tape. The one thing I would like to see disclosed in the picture or description of this product is that the case is PLAIN WHITE ON ALL SIDES, with no indication that it contains first aid supplies. I remedied this deficiency by using two six inch lengths of red duct tape to put a large "red cross" on the top side.
