review/text: I was surprised how easy and effective this little device was for helping alleviate my chronic PF symptoms. After years of boxing, jumping rope and running, my feet were a mess. By the time I finally went in and got my diagnosis, my PF tendon was swollen to twice it's normal size. I tried everything from ice, heat, salves, and even regular shots of cortisone, to no avail. This thing works pretty well. I alternate feet from night to night. 2 consecutive nights usually does the trick.
