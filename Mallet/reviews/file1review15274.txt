review/text: I love the Honey Peanut plus Ginseng Balance Bars. They tasted the most like a candy bar of all the energy bars I've tasted. Chocolate coated with a creamy inside and a few peanut chunks, it reminds me of a peanut butter cup. This was definitely something I looked forward to eating, which I can't say about all the energy bars I've tried. I'd actually buy these.
