review/text: 5lbs of protein for less money than 3lbs of other products (for example, GNC AMP). Dissolves very well, an entire serving in an 8 oz cup and it dissolves, I am not used to this. The product works, it's cheap, and above all, it's a supplement. It's there to help you, not do the work for you. Don't think twice, buy ON 100% Whey, and buy it from Amazon.
