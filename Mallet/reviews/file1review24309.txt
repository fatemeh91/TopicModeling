review/text: Hurt like crazy the first three days, but my back felt better immediately. It might have been because of the new pain in my foot distracted from the pain in my back . I only wore them around the house on the low setting for about an hour a day the first two days. Then I gradually started to use them in longer walks and I am even running in them now with hardly feeling the pads. For the past ten years I almost always had back pain after every time I ran. I only feel slight back pain now after running that usually goes away after a couple of hours. One recommendation I would make to a new user of the foot pads would be to use an old pair of shoes where the arch is already worn out. This will cut down on some of the pain until your foot adjusts.
