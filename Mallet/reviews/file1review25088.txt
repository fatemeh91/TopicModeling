review/text: I received a letter from my home alarm company stating that I had a low battery condition. Sure enough, my alarm board confirmed this. After looking up battery size, connector type, volt and amp specs found on a schematic within my alarm box, I found this battery on Amazon. The price was right and the shipping rates not bad considering the company has to ship haz mat rates. The company shipped quickly and the battery was as described on Amazon. It took less than a minute to unconnect the old battery and reconnect the new one. It took overnight for the battery to fully charge. After resetting my alarm box, no more low battery condition indicator. I rated my experience with this battery at five stars but I will be less than thrilled if I don't get at least 3-5 years or more of battery life. I've lived in this house for 10 years and the old battery was in place when we moved in. One more thing, the old battery was warm to the touch the few times I was in the alarm box. The new battery is now cool to the touch. I don't know if that means anything but thought I would mention it.
