review/text: my hubby decided, after trying a norelco, that he wanted a foil razor back and Wahl had always been good to him, so I bought this one. It's a great razor, but when he unpacked it, the bottom separated from it as if the glue wasn't there to hold it. He must have 'snapped' it back together, because he's shaving fine (which is what matters most to me!) and it's working well. He loves that he's able to use it both with or without a cord...which he couldn't with his last one.
