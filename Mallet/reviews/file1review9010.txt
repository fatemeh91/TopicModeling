review/text: I had a similar experience to another reviewer. It caused extremely low blood sugar for me. It wasn't subtle at all, made me extremely shaky, mostly in the mornings. I gave it a couple weeks to see if the effect wore off but it didn't. Had a couple times where I was stuck driving and literally felt like I was going to pass out. I've never had a problem like this before and have felt like that only a couple times. Guess it's time for a DR checkup, might just be hypoglycemic. Not trying to be dramatic, just sharing the negative effects it had on me.The positives: aside for the morning shakes and low blood sugar, I definitely slept better and woke up WAY easier. When I stopped taking I definitely feel a little like there's a cloud overhead, not as easy to get going in the mornings. I really wish I COULD take it because I think what people are saying here is correct. I think it IS a great product but it's not going to work for the few of us that are adversely affected by milk thistle. For what it's worth, the Trader Joe's green powder has the same effect on me (tried it after GV), just not as pronounced.I think it's a great product, 1 star ONLY because I think people should be aware of this side effect (for some)
