review/text: Great concept, but it feels like a whip-lash neck brace. I can't wear it long enough to get the benefit without feeling clastrophobic. I still use it, just not secured around my neck. Could be very useful for wrapping a knee or shoulder though. If I turn it upside down, it snuggles around the neck much nicer.
