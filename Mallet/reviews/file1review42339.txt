review/text: I had never heard of this product until I ended up in rehab due to a medical condition that caused my body to be very week. I actually had probelms being able to stand in a shower or even sit in a tub. So for awhile I had to wash myself along side of the bed, if there wasn't a nurse available to assist me.When I was given this product to use, I was surprised at how good it worked, and also that I was still able to feel clean. That was a couple of years okay, and now I'm finding myself going through the same problem. So I'm happy to find out that I am able to purchase this product myself.This makes me feel that I am still in control. Thanks ConvaTec for making such a great product.
