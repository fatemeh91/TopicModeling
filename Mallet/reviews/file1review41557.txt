review/text: I previously had a Sonicare Inteliclean which was horrible. In addition to it being just a bad brush the Sonicare customer service was a joke. So I said "never again" and I went to the competitor. Boy am I glad! This is a great brush. Compact, light, and powerful. And the brushes cost a lot less than the Sonicare models. I am super satisfied.
