review/text: I bought this liquid vitamin for my teenage son who is recovering from jaw surgery and can ingest only liquids for six weeks. When he got a whiff of the contents of this bottle, he almost gagged. (Not a good thing with a wired jaw!) I told him he was overreacting, so I demonstrated how palatable it would be by taking a taste...I almost gagged! The product write up talks about the "tasty" liquid. No way! This is nasty stuff! Might be good for you, but first you have to screw up the courage to drink it! No thanks!!
