review/text: We do love Enfamil with iron the original, however the Lipil made our baby VERY fussy and gassy. We always supplemented with Enfamil with iron since birth, but when I stopped breastfeeding, I thought I should give him formula with ARA and DHA. Unfortunately he could not tolerate it. I tried Similac Advanced because I read that it had lower levels. Same problem, but not as bad. I have decided to just stick with the original Enfamil and hope for the best. I do believe that this ARA and DHA is causing problems for a lot of babies. I read all over the net about people constantly switching brands, going to soy, and hypoallergenic formulas, when they should just try the original formulas that we all grew up on, and turned out OK. We are making ourselves and the babies crazy with this new stuff.
