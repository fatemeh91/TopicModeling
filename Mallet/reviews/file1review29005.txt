review/text: I have a goatee and I have been looking for a single shaving device that would trim and define my beard and also give me a decent shave for those times when I don't want to use a razor. The cruzer3 was the only device I could find that claimed to do all three tasks. I took a chance and ordered it through Amazon - and I'm very happy with the purchase. The shaver works well; not as good as a razor of course, but it's great for touching up spots I missed or a full shave when I'm in a hurry. The trimming blades are well-shaped and work much better than I thought they would. A blade that extends 90 degrees from the handle works best for trimming and defining, but the cruzer3's blades work well (you just have to tilt the shaver 90 degrees from your face). The beard trimmer attachment also works well. I have a hair trimmer that I use for buzz cuts and was using it for beard trimming, but the cruzer3 works just as well. And it's one less device I have to keep track of. Finally, I appreciate the fact that I can rinse off the unit with water when I'm done. I am completely satisified with the cruzer3; it meets all of my requirements for an all-purpose shaver/trimmer.
