review/text: This is the best laxative tea I have ever used.The first thing that I love about it is that it begins to work anywhere from 6-10 hours after taking it. It never gave me any cramps, and I didn't end up with severe diarrhea as some laxative teas in the past have done to me.I'm doing the Master Cleanser (Diet/Colon Cleanse) by Stanley Burroughs and I have been drinking this tea every morning and night for the past 2 weeks and I have really loved it. It's really been helpful for me to have a product that works so good and does what it is supposed to do without causing me any pain. I wont use any other laxative tea!And...This tea comes in different flavors. Organic Smooth Move (original) which tastes a bit like black licorice and the Chocolate Organic Smooth Move that has a mild Chocolate flavor (not very strong at all). Both are very good.It's a bit expensive for tea but it's worth it. I pay roughly around $5 a box. I suppose that really isn't that expensive considering there are some teas that say they do the same thing but aren't as gentle.I read that some people had cramps in the reviews. That's so strange because I haven't had cramps even once, which leads me to think that perhaps these people may have had a lot of gas built up in their gut before taking this, I can't see how this could cause pain, it's really been wonderful.
