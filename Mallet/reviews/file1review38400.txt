review/text: I used to pay for waxing. I chanced upon this product at a Sharper Image store and paid 99.99:-(. In my case I think it is a worthwhile buy. LIke it says, it pulls out hair by the roots. It does its work. The first time it was a little intimidating. Now it is a breeze. I used to have thick black hair on my legs. Now they are really fine and not as noticeable. I dont have to shave or wax at all. It works great on underarms. It requires courage(HA HA HA) to pull out the underarm hair!!!! OUCH!!!!Would recommend it anybody who is spending more than 30 dollars per visit to a beautician and needs to go atleast twice a month!!
