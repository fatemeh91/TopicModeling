review/text: I have an older version of the WaterPik that is much simpler in design, and limited in versatility.What I like:A good range of useful attachments to enhance oral hygiene.Good design of attachment and wand storage.Controls are placed for ergonomic ease of use.Easy attachment and removal of cleaning tool tips that are color coded for easy identification.Water flow and pressure are easily adjustable and the wand rotates 360 degrees.Large reservoir to hold enough water/mouthwash mixture to service two people.The price was extremely good.What I don't like:The water flow cutoff button on the wand is hard to use and is a momentary off. I would prefer a button that is easier to operate. The quality of this one is poor.The wand has a sloppy swival connection where the quick release coupling is connected to the main body of the wand. I would like to see a little less slop.Summary: This is a great product and is reasonably priced. It has improved my health remarkably by helping keep my gums free of food debris in hard to reach areas. It is hard to believe how much food debris can be lodged in the gums and in between the teeth even after rigorously brushing, flossing, and rinsing with mouthwash.
