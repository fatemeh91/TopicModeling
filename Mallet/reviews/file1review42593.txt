review/text: I recently tried some some of this (vanilla) and it is probably the best tasting and easiest to drink. First, I only had to use 2 scoops to get 48 grams of protein, added water and shook in a regular plastic bottle not protein shaker. I had no problem mixing in and there were no clumps or grain, went down like vanilla water and was not heavy at all. You know that bloated full feeling you get afterwards, not with this. Will be buying a 5lb tub, I will revise my ratings after I see the results.
