review/text: I purchased this product over Christmas and have been pleased well into the new year! I own a Dyson vac with the pet turbo brush, however, I no longer have to bring out the large vac every day with this ultra powered hand held with the pet turbo brush. It works much better than the $70 brush attachment that goes with the Dyson. I highly recommend this item to any family that has pets.
