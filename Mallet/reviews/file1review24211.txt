review/text: The product came packaged very well, but the letters were smudged and barely readable on the card.For a card used to do vision screening the letters should be clear and crisp, which these were not.Will probably work for tuning skis though, scraping old wax off, about the only thing it is good for.So if you are looking for this for using in medicine, as I was, I would definitely look elsewhere!!
