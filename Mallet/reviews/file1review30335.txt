review/text: This little dust buster gets every dog and cat hair off of my microfiber couch! The suction it has is very impressive. The only thing that I found slightly disappointing was that it doesn't get hair off of car upholstery as easily, and puts out a lot of heat, but it is compact and wonderful around the house!
