review/text: I have had my Emjoi for over two years now, and it still does a good job for me. The product removes hair at the root, leaving skin silky smooth for about a week until new growth begins. If I used it more often, I am sure that after some time, I could use it even less than 1X per week. It will even remove very short hairs. I use mine on my legs and underarms. I am not brave enough to use it in the bikini area. I have light-colored, sparse hair, and I really don't think it hurts at all to use - - - I have a friend who has dark, coarse hair, and she couldn't stand to use it, so be advised. For the times you need to be done in a hurry, it even includes a shaving head attachment.Speaking of being in a hurry - - you had better have some time to devote when you use this product. It takes quite a while to do a good job -- you will have to make many passes over your legs in order to do a good job (of course, the benefit is smoother legs for a longer time than shaving, and hair grows in thinner and sparser with each use.) One serious drawback though is ingrown hairs. If you use this product, I guarantee you will get them.So, I guess all in all, it does what it says it will do. Just keep in mind that if you have dark hair, it will likely hurt, and be prepared to spend some time when you use it. Just a final thought - - you can help keep the ingrown hairs at bay by using a natural loofah with some grainy scrub when you shower, as well as using a lotion with alpha-hydroxy in it.If all that sounds like a big pain in the a*s to you, I would stick with your razor.
