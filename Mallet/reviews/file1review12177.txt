review/text: I've been using the Prenatal One and Women's OneRainbow Light Womens One, Just Once Multivitamin, 150 Tablets(not at the same time) for about 3 years now and I will never use a different multi-v. These pills are on the large size, but I don't have a problem with it. I can definitely feel a difference in my body when I skip a few days of these. Plus, I'm gluten intolerant and am always worried about gluten being present as a binding ingredient in medications. I've recommended this brand to many friends and got my husband hooked on the Men's OneRainbow Light Men's One Multi, 150-Count
