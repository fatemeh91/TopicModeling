review/text: There are a lot of reviews on here about the handle coming apart. Yes it does seem to work itself loose in the short week that I've owned it. But for Pete's sake it's a $25 push sweeper. If you're looking for a really durable product get a Dyson or a Hoover power vacuum. You should expect to get what you pay for.That aside, this thing does a great job of picking up the smallest debris around your house. Don't feel like getting out your vacuum and plugging it in then connecting needed adapter to get to that hard to reach spot? Just pull this out of the closet instead and knock out that crumb mess in your living room. This little vacuum gets those easy jobs that you don't want to go to a lot of effort for. Get it. If you've got an issue with the vacuum handle, take the suggestions on here and add some electrical tape or some carpet tape to hold it on. I just remember to check the handle whenever I get it out of the closet.
