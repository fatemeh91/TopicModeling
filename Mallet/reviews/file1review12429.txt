review/text: After trying out, literally, a gazillion different lip balms, I finally discovered this one from my sister and I love it. I have chronic chapped lips AND skin, so it's always realy hard to find the perfect lip balm for me. Most of the balms I've tried makes my lips feel even worse a lot of the time, and it feels as if I just put a layer of wax ontop instead of it feeling moist. I was a frequent user of Carmex, but after awhile it started to make my lips extremely irritated and would even leave out this really weird, wet discharge just like petroleum jelly/Vaseline would do. Un-petroleum instantly makes my lips feel softer and it doesn't make them burn, nor does it make them "puss." I love the tangerine in it too. Smells delicious.
