review/text: Who's to say that I wouldn't have gotten pregnant without it, but I was having a strangely long anovulatory cycle, took Fertilaid for 5 days, had a period, 2 weeks later I ovulated and voila! I won't attribute the pregnancy 100% to the product, but I think it probably helped. Worth the money.
