review/text: I was referred to this product by a friend who swears by them. I was skeptical but now I am a devoted MagO7 consumer. For someone that really needs the extra help, these pills truly helped without the cramping as mentioned by others. Definitely start with 2 if your a woman and bump it to 3 if that doesn't work. I will always keep a bottle handy. It also helps to start on Friday evening (bottle says to take before bed) so you can get the majority of the cleanse in progress over the weekend and you will be fine for the work week.
