review/text: This is my favorite flavored lubricant for oral sex! We've tried about a dozen flavored lubes in the past couple years and this is the one I always reach for because it has a very yummy taste (I could probably drink it out of the bottle if I didn't care about the cost). (I don't use it for intercourse, so if that's your intent, then my 5 star review isn't applicable to you.) To the reviewer who said it tasted artificial... bubble gum isn't exactly a "natural flavor." It's supposed to be a little over-the-top. The flavor lasts a long time, too.
