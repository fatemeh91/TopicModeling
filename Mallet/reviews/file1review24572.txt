review/text: Those who insisted that this pill does not work is seriously full of crap! If u are going to be solely dependent on this pill without moving your ass! I am sorry! You should not spend a dime on it! This pill indeed speeds up your metabolism however without incorporating any exercise in your daily routine will just simply backfires. Trust me, it works for me I know many people will come up with ton of excuses trying to shun away from working out. For instance, too tired from work, too much work to do, not seeing results from previous work out so decided to give up! Bullshit! For this pill to work, you have to exercise. it does not naturally speeds up your metabolism. U need to work out, while working out it increase your metabolism rate to burn off those fats. Next stick on a low-carb high protein diet. Make sure you take sufficient of multi vitamins as reducing the amount of food causes some nutrient deficiency.
