review/text: The description said the bandages are 2x4.5 inches-- and they are, but the sterile pad is more like 1 inch by 1.5 inches at best. There's way too much adhesive around the pad when there should've been a bit more pad. The small pad makes these ineffective for large wounds. I wound up using 2 together when I only needed to use one of a similar bandage by 3M or Bandaid. The edges of the bandage did fray a bit, but that might have been from wearing it for about 12-16 hours. That is the one major plus-- the bandage sticks and you aren't left with a bunch of adhesive residue, like with those 3M bandages (which leave residue and DON'T stick for long). These breathe very well, and stay put even with humidity and perspiration.
