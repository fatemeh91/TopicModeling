review/text: I've been taking Green Vibrance for a little over a week now and noticing a difference in my energy so far, no longer crave my usual two shots of espresso in the morning.I mix in a scoop with my usual morning smoothie that consists of frozen blueberries, frozen strawberries, some blueberry kefir, probiotic stony farms strawberry yogurt and almond milk. Don't notice a bad taste at all!
