review/text: This is by far the best natural deodorant I have found. It works better than my conventional one even. I looked it up on EWG and it's rates a 0 (out of 10) so it's non-toxic too. The biggest thing to keep in mind is that it has no fragrance. So while you won't stink, you won't smell like baby powder or whatever you're used to with the scented products.
