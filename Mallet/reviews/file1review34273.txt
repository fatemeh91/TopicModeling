review/text: I got this for my father who has been suffering from internal hemorrhoids for a long period of time with problems of blood in stools as well. He told me that he was having difficulty even to walk around at times, and it was not only painful, but also itchy.I got him this along with Prep H wipe. After few weeks of use, he told me that he can walk now without pain, and the coolness feels nice. I don't think this ointment actually helped him to get healed from the hemorrhoids, but only help to numb the area. BTW, he told me that the Prep H Wipe didn't do much help at all, it was more like just a regular baby water wipe.
