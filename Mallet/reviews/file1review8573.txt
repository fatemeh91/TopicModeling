review/text: I was using a bigger brush while cleaning the bathroom and realized I could not for the life of me get into small nooks and crannies as well as corners while cleaning! So onto amazon I go, in search of a bathroom brush. This one looked like it fit what I was looking for so I bought it. The bristles are hard which is excellent for scrubbing and the long rubber grip handle is great. I was able to get into all the nooks and crannies and the bathroom is now spotless. I love OXO products!
