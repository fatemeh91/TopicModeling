review/text: I use this mask at least 4 times a week. Every since my laser PRK surgery (one year ago), I've suffered with extremely dry, painful eyes upon waking. My doctor recommended using heat. I wet a washcloth, heat this mask in the microwave for a few seconds and put them both on my eyes. The heat lasts for about 15 minutes. I find the wet washcloth is necessary because the mask does get very hot.It really has helped with my dry eye problem.
