review/text: For the price of $25.00 when I bought it, this is definitely a great product. I love that the trimmer can adjust to 9 different trimming lengths with just 1 comb instead of multiple attachments that takes time to replace, takes up space to pack and can possibly get lost.The trimmer claims to have self-sharpening blades but I haven't owned this product long enough to validate this claim.This trimmer is rechargeable through a provided AC adapter. It does come with its own LED charging indicator, however NOTE that the LED will only tell you that the unit is charging; it will not tell you when the charge is complete. The charging indicator is simply what it is, a light to tell you that the unit is indeed charging, that's it.The trimmer DOES run while it is being charged but I do not know if this means that it is indeed running while charging simultaneously. I will have to drain the battery one day and test this out for sure.As for the performance of the trimmer. It does what it's advertised to do. My beard is nicely trimmed. The unit is very sturdy since I do apply a fair amount of pressure when I trim and not once has the comb slipped down to its shorter length settings. I don't have very thick facial hair so therefore the trimmer cuts nicely. I do not know if it is powerful enough to handle people with very thick facial/body hair.It definitely does work as a body trimmer as well.
