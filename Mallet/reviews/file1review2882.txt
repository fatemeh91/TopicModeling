review/text: Summer sandal season is hard on my feet and they seem to get callused so easily. I have been using pumice stones to keep them looking nice. When I saw this screen with a handle and read the great reviews I wanted to give it a try. Now I am hooked, it works really well. The handle is nice and thick and sturdy so you can apply pressure to your feet without it bending and the screen works the calluses down easily. This set comes with replacement screens and cream. The cream is fairly greasy so you will want to put on socks after applying but by morning it leaves your skin nice and soft.
