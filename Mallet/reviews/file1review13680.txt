review/text: Going from class to class every day makes it difficult to stay caffinated. Without these mints I would have fallen asleep in many a class. If I graduate, it will have been in large part because of the help I got from these mints. I have to chew about 6 or 7 during a really boring class when I had only 4 hours of sleep. But usually I can get through a class with only 3. They don't give me headaches or make me crash. They just keep my eyes open and sometimes make me type a little faster.Whenever the person sitting next to me starts zoning out, I usually slide the tin over and boy are they grateful.
