review/text: This product is just as described. I am 7 months pregnant, and I have been suffering for about 3 months of back pain, plus my hips are too loose and hurt, my belly was hurting quite a bit too, trying to carry the weight of my baby and there wasn't must I could do. I couldn't walk for more than a few blocks....(less than 10 at a time, and ten was a lot... just in a good day)I've been wearing that belt for a week and a half, and most of the pain is gone. My back and hips feel a LOT better (not completely painless, but that's pregnancy...) and my belly doesn't hurt! I just went for a 3 miles walk (ok, it was a bit much, but 2 miles felt fine). And that's the longest (by far) that I have been able to walk since I was about 3-4 months pregnant!I recommand this product to any woman who suffers like it did. I am so happy with it, and wish I had bought it sooner...
