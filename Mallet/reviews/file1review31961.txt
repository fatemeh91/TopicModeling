review/text: I love this stuff! I immediately feel better and have more energy when I drink it. However when I first tried it and put a whole scoop in 8 oz of water I totally gagged and could not handle it. I called the company and a very nice fella told me to just put a teaspoon or less in eight ounces of water and drink it that way til I get used to it and you know that worked great! It has taken a while. But I now I have a big 16 oz coffe mug that I measure 4 teaspoons of green drink into every day and fill the mug up with water . That's what I have "worked up to ". I think they should put those instructions on the container for people who havn't had green drinks before. I sure couldn't handle the full scoop at first and sound like alot of others have that challenge too!
