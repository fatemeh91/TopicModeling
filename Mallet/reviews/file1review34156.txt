review/text: I like this product because I have hair that has low porosity, which means it takes forever to dry -- upwards of 6 hours and my hair is about 3 inches long. This conditioner greatly reduces the drying time (~2 hours) without sacrificing the moisture. It doesn't coat my hair and is pleasantly scented. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is that it could afford to be just a tad richer.
