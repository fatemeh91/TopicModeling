review/text: I've used Jack Black Electric Shave for abut two years now and I honestly don't know how I shaved before without it. It definitely lubricates my skin and makes my skin feel much less dry and irritated. And it doesn't gum up my razor like I thought it might. Not sure what the other reviewers are talking about. If you don't shave right away it will start to dry out that is true, but if you just add some water it works great. And it does have a good smell.
