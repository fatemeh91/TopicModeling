review/text: This is my 2nd Wahl razor - I purchased one several years ago and really liked it. I did have some trouble because the foil heads seemed to break easily. Tried a few other brands of razors (in the $50-$75 range) over the last few years only to decide that I was most happy with the Wahl even with the foil head issue. I was getting ready to head out of town for the weekend when my last razor finally died on me. I couldn't find one (a Wahl) in a local store, but knew what I wanted and decided to check Amazon. They had it for a lower price than ordering it from Walmart and having to wait to pick it up at the local store. So I ordered in Wednesday afternoon, and with our Prime membership along with a small extra charge for next day delivery had my brand new razor on my porch Thursday night when I came home from work.
