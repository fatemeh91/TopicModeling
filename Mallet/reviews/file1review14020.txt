review/text: Moldable THERMOFITTING Teeth Whitening Trays were easy to mold. The directions are pretty easy to understand. Personal use it took a few times dipping it in very hot water, biting down hard and pressing the front against my teeth to get a nice snug fit. I also thought that the whiting system I used spread easily on the tray. Three trays came in the kit and are reusable. I rate this Moldable THERMOFITTING Teeth Whitening Trays very easy to use and rate it a 5 star item. I would recomend the trays. Shipping was fairly quick and arrived in a bubble wrap envolope with the sealed clear bag to keep the trays free of damage.
