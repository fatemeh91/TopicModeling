review/text: I bought this after trying a Conair. The Conair was useless...it didn't seem to work at all.This results from the Panasonic were/are instantaneous for both ear and nose hairs. After standing in front of my mirror like a fool with the Conair looking for results, this product exceeded my expectations. My only complaint is that the process is a little more painful or at least startling when it comes to trimming nose hairs. Sometimes, this product can bring tears to yours eyes. Bottom line though is that it works.
