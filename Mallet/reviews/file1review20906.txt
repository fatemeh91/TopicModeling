review/text: I have been using a blade razor since I started shaving at 16 some 25 years ago. I had always heard electric razors burn your face and don't give a decent shave no matter the brand or type of electric razor you used. This may or may not be true of past electric razors, but I'm hear to tell you this Braun Activator 8585 is one fantastic razor. Now I'm not going to say the shave is as close as my old Mach 3 is, but it is pretty darn close. I have found that my face is actually less irritated with the Braun than when shaving with a blade, all with out having to clean up the shaving gel and stubble from the bathroom sink. I can honestly say I will not be returning to a razor blade again. I am officially a Braun 8585 Activator man!
