review/text: I bought these heel lifts because I have scoliosis and therefore one leg is shorter than the other. I wear one of these lifts in my left shoe and find I can walk a little more gracefully. The heel lift has fit in every one of my shoes without needing to be cut or changed in any way--so it fits in athletic shoes and dress shoes (flats). It does not slide around or change position at all. Of course it would not work in sandals unless you somehow glue it in. The heel lift can be easily transfered from one shoe to another so you don't have to buy a pair of these for every shoe you own. I am very pleased with this product. It is much cheaper than a custom orthodic.
