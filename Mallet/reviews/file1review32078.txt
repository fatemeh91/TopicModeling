review/text: I spilled soy sauce on my shirt while eating lunch right before taking my dog for a walk, so I used the Tide stick and it removed the stain. The whole time I was on the walk, I thought I had stepped in something. I checked the bottom of my shoes, as well as the dog's paws, but found nothing. When I went inside and the smell did not go away, it finally occurred to me that it was from the Tide stick.On the other hand, it works great. You've got to choose between having a stain and smelling bad, I guess.
