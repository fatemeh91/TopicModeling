review/text: Crest bills their Deep Clean Cool Mint Floss as being more comfortable than other floss and providing a "cooling blast of clean feeling." On these counts, I can agree. Glide Deep Clean is wonderfully smooth and comfortable, making flossing downright pleasant on both your gums and your fingers. The width of the floss prevents the tourniquet effect of thinner flosses. And there is a pleasant cool, minty feeling left behind wherever you've cleaned.But... It's the single most expensive floss I can find in any of my local stores, and even on Amazon. And Crest's claims of being "shred resistant" fall short. My Glide Deep Clean was shredded right out of the package, and shreds further every time you tear off a new piece. To be fair, I haven't yet had it shred in the course of flossing, but the fact you can't even cleanly cut a strip off without shredding doesn't inspire confidence. At the price premium Crest is demanding, I'd expect Glide Deep Clean to cut well and in one piece.
