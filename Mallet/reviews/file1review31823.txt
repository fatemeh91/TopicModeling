review/text: I use this in smoothies, and sprinkle onto warm (not hot) foods. This really helps digestion, and help prevent the tired feeling after occasional heavy meals. The bulk powder is much cheaper for the quantity than capsules. I looked around and did not find any other blends that had 20 different enzymes for anywhere close to this price.
