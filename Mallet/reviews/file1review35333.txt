review/text: I'm not sure why, but the package says these guide combs are for "Model 23," "Model 179," and "Model 616"--but that's not an exhaustive list. My Oster hair trimmer/buzzer (whatever you call it) says "MODEL 281 - 15 SERIES B." These guide combs fit perfectly on it. This set is exactly like the set that it came with.The seller got the order out right away, so I had it within a few days.
