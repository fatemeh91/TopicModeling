review/text: This product does exactly what it says it does. I am in my 7th month of pregnancy, and about two weeks ago I started having the most excruciating pain in my extreme lower back (down by my sacrum and radiating to the left part of my pelvic bone). It felt like all the bones there were just grinding against each other, and I could hardly walk or lift myself up from lying down.I had was in a car accident years ago that slightly misaligned my upper back, so that very occasionally I have pain in my neck. I am sure that this misalignment contributed to my pregnancy back pain, and I was afraid that since that was the case I might just have to suffer through it. But I got this product in the mail yesterday, put it on, and the pain subsided a bit throughout the day. I took it off to sleep, put it back on this morning, and now the pain is completely gone! I can't believe it.Anyway, I highly recommend this band to anyone suffering from this sort of discomfort. Take note, however, that this is a serious, heavy duty maternity band. I would not suggest you buy it if you don't have back pain. It's quite bulky and thick, which I'll gladly deal with over the alternative, but if you are just looking for something lightly supportive that looks smooth under clothes, buy something else. I wish I could get by with something more lightweight, but since I cannot, the benefits of this band far outweigh the nuisance of it.
