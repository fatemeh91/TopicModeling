review/text: I'm surprised at the reviews elsewhere complaining about the poor quality. Either they got duds, or I got lucky. As discussed elsewhere, if you're complaining about it not working at 10K ft, complain to a physicist or chemist, and let them explain what's going on.My Helios works great. I've had it for a couple of years now. What do I like about it? Lights every time. Burns hot. Cap opens all the way.I'd probably buy the $15 tall skinny one some other company makes, but the cap only goes 90 degrees. Deal killer.I wish it was smaller, though. The rubber edging doesn't seem to serve any useful purpose, and it makes it bulkier.I wish it was metal, because I'm often melting the ends of ropes and 550 cord, and I'd like to press the end against a piece of metal when I'm done to flatten the melted cord.Sorry to those that have had bad luck. I slipped mine to my brother at his wedding (he had to use it to light the uncooperative unity candle), and I'm buying another one now -- that's how I found these reviews. I wish there was a decent competitor on the market, but there doesn't seem to be.
