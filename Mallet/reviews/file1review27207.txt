review/text: Very good protein powder. I prefer this to the thicker &#34;shakes&#34; because it feels very light and is easy to digest. The glutamine and BCAAs are helpful and useful in ON's lower cost protein. I'd recommend this over the more expensive ones because it's less marketing, more value.
