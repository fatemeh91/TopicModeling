review/text: We already own a heavy upright Hoover, which does a great job. I wanted something lighter and easier for quick pickups in the kitchen and hall. This little Bissell is great. It's basic, to be sure, but it works on the throw rugs and the hardwood, and for some strange reason, long after the novelty wore off, the kids are more willing to use it than the broom. Gotta love that, especially for the price.
