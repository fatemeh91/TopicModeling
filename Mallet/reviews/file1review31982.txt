review/text: So, considering the other reviews, I was braced to down something vile. However, the concoction tastes pretty good, kind of like green tea. I'm not an health nut, and I haven't tried any other brands. I'm just in it to get my greens, without actually having to eat a salad. I'm not getting the chalky or bitter aftertaste. Maybe, they changed the recipe.
