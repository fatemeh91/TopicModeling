review/text: I'm admittedly only one person, but as a user of a rotary razor, and a recent purchaser of this Braun, I thought my experience may be useful.The Braun actually does provide a very close shave, but it takes more time than the Norelco I'd been using. Additionally, it's not as good on the neck hairs and other challenging spots.The Norelco is really, really fast, for five shaves after you clean it. Then it begins to stumble over each additional hair, and after two weeks of non-cleaning, it almost can't handle it.And this was the part I couldn't stand, cleaning the Norelco every two weeks. Looking back, I'm not sure which to pick. The Norelco is great, but requires lots of maintenance. The Braun is a much closer shave, but takes much more time to shave. It's a question of balancing your laziness. Do you want to clean the thing every single week? If so, go with a rotary. If not, and I think I'm leaning towards this camp, I'd stick with the Braun. It takes more time every shave, but not cleaning it is a blessing I can't fully describe.
