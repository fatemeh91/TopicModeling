review/text: Re: Philips Norelco HQ177 Cool Skin Replacement Heads for 7700 Series ShaversGet the replacement heads for this great shaver: you WON'T be dissappointed.Bought the Philips 7737X Electric Shaver two years ago and the shave still ROCKS! The replacement heads for this shaver are well worth the cost. I have fairly sensitive skin and have had several electric shavers in the past. After shaving with ANY sort of razor, I end up with red, irritated skin, or cuts, or both.....until now. This razor does exactly what it says: gives you a close, quick shave any time, day or night.Being able to use it in the shower is the best benefit. Also, the included moisturizer (from Nivea) makes the shave as close as any blade, with NO irritation or cuts.Replace the heads once a year and you'll never have a bad shave again.
