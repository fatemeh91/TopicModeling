review/text: The Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Foot Creme was one of the best cremes I've ever tried. I noticed a difference after the first time I used it. I especially liked that the cream wasn't too thick to smooth on. It also wasn't hard to rub in. I'd recommend this product to anyone and will continue to use it.
