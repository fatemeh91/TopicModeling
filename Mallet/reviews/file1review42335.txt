review/text: I have it and there are a lot of times where I am unable to get in the shower or tub. I have used other body washes, no rinse type, and they left me feeling sticky and not clean. I am pleased with this body wash. It goes on quick and easy, no sticky feeling, no perfume, and leaves me feeling clean and fresh. I will re-order this product.
