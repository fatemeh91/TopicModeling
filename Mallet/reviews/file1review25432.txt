review/text: This was a handy little thing until I tried to use it after only using it 3 times, and it was just totally dead. I put new batteries in, fiddled with it, took the top piece off and screwed back on tighter, etc. Nothing would fix it, it's just dead. I guess that's what you get when it's so cheap, but pretty disappointing...
