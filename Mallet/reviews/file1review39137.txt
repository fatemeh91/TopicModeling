review/text: My wife decided to help me cut the haircutting costs..now I have a Peyton Manning type of haircut which is not hard to achieve and i used to pay 15-20 $ for every haircut I had..my wife really likes me clean and short "haired" and she decided to pitch in to "cutting the family costs"..so she learnt how to cut MY hair..which is kinda simple..this review is done 1 year later, we used it around 12 times(once a month) and we had no trouble with it.It is sturdy and solid, yes it is not light but you can't have it all for 26$..overall it saved us lots of money and time.Amazon delivery was as better than promised(check out page mentioned 5-7 days, i got it in 4 at a US address)
