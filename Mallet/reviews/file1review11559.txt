review/text: All of my Duracell 2650mah batteries have gone bad.I have other Duracell batteries I bought before I got the 2650's and they are still going strong. I use a high quality charger so it's a problem with the batteries for sure.If you buy these batteries, make sure you have a long warranty and a good return policy!The only batteries I buy now are eneloop AA and AAA since they their charge for a much longer time than any other battery I have found. I have to charge my Duracells the night before I use them, the eneloops I can charge the month before and the eneloops are still fully charged! The duracells lose their charge quickly.
