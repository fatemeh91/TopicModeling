review/text: Unlike most of the reviews, mine is VERY positive. These do the job. Be sure to follow the directions and trim away excess pieces witha a sharp pair of scissors and you should have no problems.Of course, at that price, I wasn't expecting anything extra special, but I did well with this product. Just be sure to read the directions..(which happen to be in about 8 different languages) :]
