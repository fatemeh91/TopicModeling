review/text: After using ""the-cheapest-brand-on-the-shelf"" for many years, the Almay deodorant was a treat! In short, it made me feel special, like I was treating myself. It did its job well as an antiperspirant and the ""powderfresh"" scent was refreshing. But there was just something intangible about the Almay that seemed like a treat. The only slight drawback is that you have to be careful turning the knob to release it. Otherwise it may come out too fast and too much. (Is there ever too much of a good thing?)
