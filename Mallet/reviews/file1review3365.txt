review/text: So my boobs were bigish (34 big b) in high school and slowly began to shrink till I was a small a. I'm 27. I hated it and went on the search for how to correct my problem. Researched it and found fenugreek is really good for you and mothers use it to help with milk production. Since its your glands that make your boobs big not just fat, that's what it wanted.I've been taking it for about 1.5-2months now. I have already increased at least one cup size! And NO I am not lactating. Phew! Of course when your breasts are growing they can be quite tender and mine def are but it is worth it! I'm filling out so I'm becoming perky and firm again.I didn't get this from Amazon, picked it up at whole foods but its cheaper here.
