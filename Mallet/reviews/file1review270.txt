review/text: My friend and I have a very large toy collection. I must say that this is my least favorite, but it is on her all time best list. I guess what I am trying to say is that this one is not for everyone. I find it far, far too large as to girth. It is simply too big for someone like myself. I do not like the ridges and I do not like the intensity of the action. Small and slow, especially when you start is more my taste. I also like gentle and this one is a bit rough, if you know what I mean. Now my friend likes it. She in fact would be happier if it were even larger. We are both rather petite but are built quite differently down there. When I do use this or she uses it on me, I do insist on a lot of lubricant and insist that things be taken quite slow, especially when we first start. I did not care for the smell of the thing when it was first unwrapped - yuk. The ears are a great concept, but a plane, very small liberator along with a human tongue is much nicer. Alone, I certainly would choose something smaller and less complicated. I guess this, like any such product, is a complete matter of taste. And trust me, this is NOT one you want to use in any other part of your body..if you know what I mean!
