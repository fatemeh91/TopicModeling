review/text: I've had this brush for a few month and use it on a regular basis.It is sturdy. I like the handle size, just about right for my small hand. The hair are flexible but scrub efficiently nonetheless. This only cons I can see is that the core of the brush is sometime just a little to big to enter really small bottles. But anything with a regular opening is no problem.
