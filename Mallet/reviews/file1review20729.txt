review/text: There are good tips and bad cheap ones that barely last a week . This is usually a result of the lighter weighted rubber that is used making cane tips and not intended for crutching . You need not worry about these . Excellent quality , lasting better than three months of DAILY use .I put tips through hell & these STOOD THE TEST !!!
