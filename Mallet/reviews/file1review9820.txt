review/text: We've purchased several so-called needle-tipped tweezers; always to come away disappointed. Either the tips didn't meet perfectly or were too wide (not a true needle-tip) or they were flimzy. This is not a good situation to be in when you're attempting to pull a tiny glass-shard out of your foot as was the case with me recently. The shard was so tiny my wife couldn't even see it but I sure could feel it! We had a lousy set of tweezers and gave up with them she had to come up with a "plan B". THIS pair, however, is perfectly aligned, needle-tipped and strong. I definitely recommend this model/brand tweezer and will be revisiting Tweezerman for our future Tweezing needs as well. A little more costly but, alas, sometimes you need to "get what you pay for".
