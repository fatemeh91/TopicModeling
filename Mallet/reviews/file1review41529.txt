review/text: I love this toothbrush!It cleans all of my teeth individually. The timer on the brush tells me when I have brushed for the recommended time. The brush heads have coloring on them that changes to tell me when it's time to change them and get new ones. The lower button on the brush allows me to change the way the brush pulsates while it is in my mouth brushing my teeth too. Ultimately, I just didn't think I could cause the bristles on the brush to come in contact with my teeth as many times manually as the Oral-B could. My teeth look great and my gums are healthy and don't hurt or bleed. A fully charged brush will stay charged for me for a week of vacation (5 days) brushing 2 (twice daily).Best of luck with yours! Let me know what your dentist says after you use it!!!!
