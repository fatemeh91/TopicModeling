review/text: I bought this because the reviews seem to be pretty good. The handle comes in 3 pieces and they don't interlock or anything, so I had to use tape to keep them together. A few weeks later, this rubber belt came off. I'm not sure why it's there in the first place because the sweeper can still sweep. It works, but it's ugly. I'm not sure what else will come off next. I would not recommend this product.
