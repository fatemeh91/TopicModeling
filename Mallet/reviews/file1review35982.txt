review/text: I made a special trip to downtown Phoenix to a barber supply store for a different product. I decided to ask the sales associate if they had any kind of pre-shave oil similar to The Art of Shaving's product but at a better price. She suggested I try Stephans shave cream. I had my doubts, but I have to say that this shave cream is fantastic. It is a very thick cream - about the consistency of a cold cream, but thicker. It gives you a smooth shave with no irritation. I decided to try shaving the most sensitive part of my neck with a somewhat dull razor going against the grain. Normally I would get terrible razor burn doing this, but it was pretty darn smooth with Stephans. As long as I can keep getting my hands on Stephans, I will probably never go back to grocery store shave gels.
