review/text: I used these and became pregnant within 4 months. (Somewhat faster than average considering our personal circumstances.) I was charting my fertility according to the "Taking Charge of Your Fertility" method, so I know these strips accurately detected ovulation. They correlated exactly with my temperature and other changes.I prefered to buy the cheapest tests and print out the directions myself, just in case we were testing for months. The directions are readily available from the seller's website. They keep the cost low by not packaging them with every item.I used small bathroom drinking cups to catch the urine. It wasn't messy once I figured out where to hold the cup. You might as well learn how to pee in a cup now if you are trying to conceive. You will be doing this for your doctor every month during your pregnancy!If you are trying to conceive, reading Toni Wechsler's book "Taking Charge of Your Fertility" will help more than any test strips.
