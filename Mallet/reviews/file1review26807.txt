review/text: The price is fantastic, the taste is great, it dissolves well, and this is the best part: only 10% of your daily cholesterol intake per scoop! Most other brands range from 20% or more, which, if you're taking two scoops after workout and eating an egg or two in the morning, will add up to one unhealthy diet. This brand helps manage your cholesterol while maintaining a pleasing taste. And yes, the taste is actually pretty good.The only negative is the artificial sweetener used. For the same price, you can get their Natural series, which has no artificial sweetener. I suggest that product instead if you're worried about the effects of sucralose on your body.Did I mention the price? $0.50 an ounce! Insane!
