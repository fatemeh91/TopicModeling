review/text: The ink on this is very blotchy and the card is translucent. The smallest and second smallest numbers are missing parts due to the blotchy ink. It makes the card virtually useless. The card being translucent also makes for a bad eye exam. I am a medical student and thought I'd live with this until I saw a WAY better card for the same price in my campus bookstore. I didn't realize just how bad this one way until I saw how good they can be. I'd buy one somewhere else instead of this very poor version.
