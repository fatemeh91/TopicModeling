review/text: There is a reason that this spice was known as "Devil's Dung". It has a very strong, fetid aroma before you cook it. However, once you fry it in oil, that smell changes into a wonderful, garlic-like taste with complex undertones. Use it sparingly until you are used to it. I have found it to be good with fried eggs, meats, and in marinades for beef and lamb. Just remember that it tastes very different once it is cooked.
