review/text: I held off doing a review until it worked on a subborn plantar wart on my foot.I have tried all the other methods, the hard to use liquid, the freeze method, the pretreated pads and even duct tape. All these methods are either too messy to use regularly or too expensive (pads). Duct tape I don't know. Duct tape does cause the skin to die and come off but I don't know if it would actually get rid of a plantar wart.Because of the hassles with these methods I was never consistent with using them. If I had used them for the same length of time I used the Wart Stick they likely would have worked but what a pain.I got my Wart Stick and started using it EVERY DAY, changing the medicine and bandaid each day. On occasion I would go two days if the bandaid was adhearing well. When the skin would peel off, I would remove all the skin I could get off without getting into live skin. After 15 weeks the wart was gone. This was all done with one wart stick and there is likely still enough to do another wart. So it lasts a long time. Who wouldn't pay 5 bucks to get rid of a wart.Bottom line it works, it does take persistence and this is a good value. My only question is, why can't I buy this in a local store anywhere? Oh well, Amazon is my go to store!
