review/text: The main reason I bought this was because the reviews online were near-stellar for this protein. I ALWAYS do research before buying anything and protein was no exception. I like this stuff, it tastes dandy, and I'm sure all the ladies notice the difference! ;) *ZING*Here is my favorite recipe that I put this Whey in:1 avacado1/2 cup of soy milk (vanilla flavored will blow your mind)1/4 cup of organic sugar (I use less normally, and if the avocado is wicked ripe I almost half the sugar)1/4 tablespoon of vanilla extract (liquid vanilla flavoring basically)THEN...I add about a 3/4 scoop of this Gold Standard Wheyand SOMETIMES add a half scoop of Juice+ powder (if I do this, I cut back on the sugar even more)[I normally double everything as to only dirty my blender just once every 2 days]... put all of this strait into a blender, blend (obviously), and pour into something to set in the fridge for 30 minutes or so to get a nice chill on it. When you come back to your shake you'll have a GORGEOUS yogurty-textured blend of delicious, and more importantly healthy, protein milk shake.Happy workouts and stay healthy. :)
