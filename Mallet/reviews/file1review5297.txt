review/text: From week 6 to week 12 of my pregnancy I threw up twice a day, and felt nauseous almost 24/7. I took anti-nausea medicine, but still felt awful and was searching for any relief. These got good reviews so I ordered 2 bags. I didn't even finish half a bag. They were ok, and somewhat took the nauseous edge away, but they weren't my first choice to try for relief. Honestly the best relief I got for morning sickness were sour icebreakers, and then lemonheads. I would buy these Gin Gins only if you enjoy ginger flavor and would eat them as regular candy anyways.
