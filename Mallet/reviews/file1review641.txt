review/text: I've had my chair for a few weeks now. In general, I like it. But before you buy it, test it out. The channels for your calves are quite narrow. I doubt grown men could use this feature. Also be aware that on this model, massage functions stop at the upper neck and don't really do shoulders or neck. It's a little noisy as well... the leather squeaks while in use. Won't bother you, but might bother others! All that said though, I am enjoying it and it's my unwind before I go to sleep at night.
