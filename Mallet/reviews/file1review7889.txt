review/text: Yeah I wrote nair about them no longer making this product. What a shame. Strong enough for coarse hair, and still washes off with water. Can't get any better (but the smell sucked-wish it was like it used to be without scent-but then again they don't make that either). When will companies learn? Now I have to go somewhere else. Thanks Nair! Idiots.
