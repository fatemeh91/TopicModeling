review/text: My son used this for early potty training (while still sitting) and my daughter is currently using it. We tried several others, and we were particularly interested in something that would be portable. The small toilets that you have to empty out every time are messy and troublesome and totally miss the portability option. The ones that fold weren't sturdy enough. This is a great shape to help hold the child in place. The hole isn't too big, so my kids weren't afraid of falling in at all. The guard on the front is great for little boys just learning, but it isn't too sharp or too tall, so it didn't get in the way of the sitting. The shape of the seat also helps to guide parents exacly where to sit the child so they won't miss. It is easy to get on and off the toilet so adults can still get to the potty quickly, or vice versa. While it doesn't fold, it is quick and easy to keep in the trunk of the car for resturaunt visits and emergency stops at convenience stores. And I found a canvas draw-string bag that I used to carry it in so I wasn't toting a potty around. This is a perfect seat.
