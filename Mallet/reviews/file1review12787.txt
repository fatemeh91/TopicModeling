review/text: This is a solid aluminum splint for the money.Note that this not a SAM brand splint - it's the same basic concept however, and works well for the same situations. It feels a bit thinner than a SAM, but I'm not worried about performance, and you can always double it over or form a reinforced shape with it.The only other thing to be aware of is that (mine at least) did not come with directions of any kind. Again, don't let that discourage you: a quick Google/YouTube search will get you the information you need, and a video is probably more helpful than an illustration. Just take the time to learn to use the splint BEFORE you need it. Having the equipment is halfway prepared, knowing how to use it is the other half. Thanks for reading!
