review/text: This is a good product. The only only thing that I do not like about it is that when you hold the handles the strong vibration feel like an electrical shock to the hands. I will find a way to pad the handles and all will be well. This is great for the pain between the shoulder blades that can be caused by numerous different organ problems that share the same nerves. It is the only thing that I know that works for this problem..
