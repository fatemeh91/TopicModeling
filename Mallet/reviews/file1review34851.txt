review/text: I have been taking this product for over two years. I first started it for a diagnosed fatty liver condition. I felt relief within a week and my liver counts were in the normal range within 6 months. The medical Doctor's recommendation for fatty liver was to eat less fat and no red meat. After seeing my counts back to normal he only said "keep on doing what ever you are doing". That is taking two of these capsules each day and eating meat, including red meat once or twice a week.
