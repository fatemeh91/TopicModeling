review/text: Fits my toilet seat perfectly. My soon feels secure and not wobbly while sitting on the seat.Never used a potty, as the BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Toilet Trainer made the toilet easy to use for my 34 month old son.Raised front area prevents little boys from having accidents while potty training.Lightweight, but well made and sturdy.Removes easily, so grown ups can use the toilet, or potty training son can stand and practice his aim!
