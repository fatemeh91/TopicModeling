review/text: I am very disappointed with THE BISSELL STURDY SWEEP SWEEPER. It does not perform well, at all. I can sweep over a small bit of paper 15-20 times before I actually need to bend down and pick it up by hand. It pushes dirt around the floor before sweeping it up. It's a total waste of time on carpets and does absolutely nothing! I went with Bissell because of its good name. I expected a reliable product that I could depend on. This is not it! I am not at all happy with this purchase!
