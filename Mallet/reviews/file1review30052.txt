review/text: My sister introduced me to this tea years ago and really liked it. I was so disappointed when our local asian store no longer carried it. Thankfully, I found it on Amazon and placed my order. I love this tea. Worried about gaining weight? Drink it after each meal as it helps rid of fat before they are absorbed/stored as fat in your body. I'm also a diabetic and this tea has helped control my blood sugar levels. Good eating habits and exercise still applies.
