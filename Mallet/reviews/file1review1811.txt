review/text: Instead of pharmaceutical drugs and ointment, I decided to use natural products that is safe. I used this product to treat the ringworms (fungi) in my hands and lower arms, which I could have got from the soil or natural fertilizer in our home garden. I started using the PediFix FungaSoap liquid after I finished gardening even if I use garden gloves. I gave the other bottle to my husband to use on his feet. After washing with this liquid soap, I can feel the tingling feeling "fresh" of my skin.
