review/text: I recieved my Bissell Swift Sweep today as promised. Great alternative to a broom for the most part. Reminds me of when I was a kid and we didnt have an electric vacuum. It does the job with a little elbow grease to move it which is another plus because you get to burn calories while cleaning. Its just great to have on the side when you just have a small spot to hit with a vacuum. Who wants to brake out a vacuum for a foot print when you can use this bad boy 2 secs and it over, no plug up or wrapping a cord up. Its a great side piece of equipment for small jobs. I got it a day early and thats always a plus
