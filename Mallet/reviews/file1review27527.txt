review/text: My nutritionist recommended this brand and its great! Low carb higher protein! I haven't tried them with water I always use Fat Free milk. The cookies-n-cream satisfies my sweet tooth. And if you use a shaker bottle and it gets frothy is the best! I also mix 1/4 scoop with those yogurt smoothies as an afternoon snack. I also have had no digestion problems with this protein like others I have tried. Double chocolate is good. The Chocolate mint was good but you get tired of it quick if you get the 5lb but we switch from the two for variety.
