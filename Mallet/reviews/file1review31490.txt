review/text: I bought this kit for a backpacker trip through Costa Rica. It truly was light weight and took up little room in the backpack. I had to add a couple of things, like small scissors for cutting moleskin, and a few extra bandages, and there was plenty of room to put these in the kit. I have not had opportunity to test the water tight aspect of the kit, but based on my satisfaction so far, I have no doubts it will live up to this claim as well.
