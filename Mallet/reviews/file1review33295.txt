review/text: I have trouble with razor burn especially in the bikini area, so I was very excited to try this product after reading the reviews. It does work well enough, although like other reviews said, it seems to just be conditioner. The problem I have is that it smells like Nag Champa incense, which I don't really like. I might try a different scent later, or the unscented version.
