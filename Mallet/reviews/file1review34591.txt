review/text: My Ph.D. is in Health Psychology, and I'm very thorough in the standards I use to evaluate whether a given supplement has yielded any benefit. Within 4 days of taking at the suggested dose, my resting pulse rate has decreased by 12 beats a minute. This is unprecedented; I've never experienced a more profound benefit so quickly.
