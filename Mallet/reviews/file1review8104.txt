review/text: I use this scrubber to clean my sinks and dishes with good effect. It has a little toggle switch in the very middle of the bristles that secretes dish soap when it is pressed allowing you to clean a lot of dishes or surfaces quickly without having to re-load your sponge with soap along the way. The bristles are strong and hold up to tough use and really are effective for getting into nooks and crannies. I don't really like to use this scrubber on my enameled cast iron cookware (I admit that I'm a freak about my Le Creuset!) but it works well on everything else!
