review/text: I must admit I was surprised to learn Amazon actually sold condoms. I would normally purchase the Magnum XL at Meijer in 12 pack quantities for about $9 or at the local drug store for about $14 and never really thought about purchasing condoms online due to the personal nature. Unfortunately, finding a good selection of large condoms at these stores was very limited. As a result, my choices were usually limited to a Magnum XL. Recently, I discovered Meijer was no longer selling the Magnum XL.Up until I tried the Durex Maximum Large, I really had no complaints about the Magnum XL. Again, I didn't have the opportunity to try anything else. I was very surprised to see the large selection of large condoms available on Amazon and I enjoyed reading the reviews because most of the guys were in the same situation as I was in; a very limited selection of larger condoms at the retail level.I had my first opportunity last night to try the Durex Maximum Large. My girlfriend said I was a different man. She would later say "Who are you and what have you done with my boyfriend" (LOL). It was incredible. It literally felt like I was wearing nothing at all and the sensitivity was amazing. I could tell from the very beginning it was different. Substantially thinner than a Magnum XL. I never really thought the Magnum XL was that uncomfortable until some of the other reviewers mentioned some uncomfortable aspects.Why wouldn't any guy try these at this incredible price?
