review/text: I bought this tub after the birth of our oldest daughter. It is a must have and works great! It makes for a much more secure feeling in such a big space for a little one. It uses much less water than a normal tub and it's easy to maintain and clean. We were able to use the original one for our second child as well. I would highly recommend this product.....it's one you can't live without!
