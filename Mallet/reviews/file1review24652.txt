review/text: I am a healthy 34 yr old female and I've been taking it for a week now. I have never had so much sustained energy . That's what Zantrex3 does. It's not a miracle pill, it doesn't melt fat, it gives you the energy to do what's necessary to burn the calories quicker than if you had little or no energy. It's not for everyone, but for those who do not suffer side effects, its a great energy boost. The first night I had trouble sleeping, but after that, I worked out so hard at the gym, I had no choice but to fall into bed tired at the end of the day and sleep like a baby.I'm very happy with the weight lost results in the first week; 3 lbs. I was at a plateau with my exercise program/weight loss for three weeks, this was the breaker. I'm very happy with the decision to use this product.
