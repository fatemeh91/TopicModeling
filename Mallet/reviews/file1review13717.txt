review/text: Bought it thinking that it would come with 2 rechargeable batteries but they werent include... But it works fine with the batteries that I already had...The Title of the listing still says "Duracell Mini Charger; 2 Rechargeable Nimh Batteries", With a picture of a retail pack with two batteries, you only know that you won't get the batteries when you get the item... it is misleading...
