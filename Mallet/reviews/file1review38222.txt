review/text: The product is effective in cleansing the intestine, and when combined with anti-tumorgenic herbs, such a ginger powder (10%, or so), and used as a delivery system for other spices such as cinnamon, turmeric, cayenne, and whatever you deem strategic for your health needs, psyllium helps minimize risk that someday a colonoscopy you're subjected to, will manifest polyps, diverticulae, infections or tumors. Scientists indicate that your intestine is 70% of your immune system, so it's only logical to make sure the "sewer" doesn't back up its toxicity into every cell of your body! The psyllium powder seems 6 times more effective than the tastier flakes.
