review/text: This is a product to pass up. The light activation button is difficult to use. It slides out of position where it won't activate the light. When you do get it aligned it doesn't illuminate consistently. It flickers on and off making it annoying to use. It is compact but the annoyances are not worth the money. Spend you money on something more reliable like a keychain LED light.
