review/text: I started taking a variety of supplements to boost my health and I do feel better. I think I bought these to help with sinus problems from allergies and like I said I feel a lot better and I think it does help with hair growth. I don't feel any better from muscle soreness or pms symptoms. Maybe one is not enough a day.
