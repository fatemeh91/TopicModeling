review/text: My daughter is kind of small so we were using size 7 pampers even though they were a little snug and leaked quite often. I figured it was time to move up. The cons are, my daughter has what we call frog legs so we can only fasten the top tape, they are some what bulkier than pampers and they are a bit pricey. The pros,they hold so much more, the smell is almost not there and she doesn't have the red marks on her hip bones any more. Oh, and I don't have to buy the diaper inserts any more. So all in all I would recommend them. I just don't understand why things for the physically challenged people have to be so expensive.
