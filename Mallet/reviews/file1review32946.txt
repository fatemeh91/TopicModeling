review/text: No doubt the liquid form is much more effective than the pills, and this product works great. I would be crippled without it. I would give it 5 stars and be much happier taking it if they didn't load it with a ton of artificial sweetener (Sucralose). Almost intolerable straight, I have to dilute with water about 10:1 to drink it, but I'll never stop taking it.
