review/text: Protein is a Hugh factor after having Gastric Bypass Surgery. This has all the nutrition needed and has the BEST taste. My friends and I have tried them all, and this is the winner. They also have lots of great flavors. I give this a well needed Five Star rating, because good Protein is a big priority in my life and taste is important.
