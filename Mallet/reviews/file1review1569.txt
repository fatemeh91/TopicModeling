review/text: I've had warts come and go for many years and have tried every over the counter remedy available. I found the PediFix WartStick in a closeout sale at a drugstore. I guess it didn't sell well because it has a horrible product name and looks like chapstick. So it's easy to miss it on a rack.But this stuff worked great. I had 2 stubborn warts on my thumb almost under the nail. I had tried the liquid and gel versions of Compound-W and Dr Scholls, but both products would flake or peel off pretty quickly. The Wart Stick, on the other hand, adhered to the skin better. Sometimes before reapplying, I would pull away some dead skin on top, but in general, I could tell it was removing the wart better than the competing products. After 2-3 weeks, the warts were gone.I highly recommend this product and hope that Pedifix continues to make it even if it doesn't sell well.
