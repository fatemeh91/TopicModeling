review/text: I was looking for a basic trimmer to use on my mustache and beard. I bought this trimmer about a month ago and so far it's been good. I've used it about 10 times and it is still buzzing away on it's original charge. The guides are easily adjustable and trim evenly. The guides are sturdy and do not slip or move while trimming. Since the blade is pretty wide it is not designed for detailed sculpting as some smaller trimmers would be, but for a basic trimming it works great.
