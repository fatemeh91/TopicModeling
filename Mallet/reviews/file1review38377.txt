review/text: I had an Emjoi Optima for about 5 years. It finally died on me so I bought another one exactly the same. Why change a good thing? It does exactly what it it supposed to do. It may hurt a little in the beginning but if you're like me you should get used to it. It doesn't bother me at all now. I love my Emjoi!
