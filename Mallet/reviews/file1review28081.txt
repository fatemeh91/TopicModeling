review/text: I took it the first couple of times with water and it tasted VERY bad... So i then tried with milk and at first thought i would be able to drink it.. But after about the 2nd or 3rd time with milk I couldn't even stand the taste it actually made me start to feel sick to my stomach...I now have a practically unused HUGE bottle of protein and I'll never use it again..
