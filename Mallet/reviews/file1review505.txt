review/text: This was my first toy i have purchased. I have always been a fan of the rabbit vibes and had a very tough time choosing which would be best for me. But i think i made a very good decision. The rotating movements and vibrating ears are a plus !!!! They feel AWESOME and get there job done fast. And it is quiet so no worries about someone hearing you. I think i use it at least 2 to 3 times a day. Although the downfalls of this vibe is it is rather large i was quite suprised when it arrived i was going to send it back but decided to give it a shot and now i love it. I would recommend lube and the size does take getting used to if your not used to your guy being large or other toys. But i would recommend this toy. So go ahead and try it you won't regret it i know i didn't !!!!!!
