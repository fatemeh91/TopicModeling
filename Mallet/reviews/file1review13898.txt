review/text: I am one of "those" people who gets up before the crack of dawn to work out before going to my job (driving a desk, so to speak).Twin Lab Ultra Fuel, Orange Powder, 3.30-Poundis excellent for giving me some (pardon the pun) fuel to get going in the wee hours of the morning. I use ~3/4 of ONE scoop (serving size is FOUR scoops) ~20min before working out along with a packet of4C Totally Light Bonus Variety Pack, Energy Rush, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 3)with ~8-10oz water and can tell a difference. My workouts are definitely better with the Ultra Fuel. Prior to using Ultra Fuel, I would drink the Energy Rush and eat a snack, but I would have to wait longer before working out (which meant getting up EARLIER than the crack of dawn) and still didn't have as much energy as with the ~3/4 scoop of Ultra Fuel.My usual workout is ~45min-1hr and can vary from circuit (weight training sets separated by 1-1:30min elliptical sprints 1/2 forward & 1/2 back) to high incline treadmill walking @ 20% incline for 2-3 miles.Hope this review helps in your efforts to be fit.
