review/text: I bought this in my 5th month of pregnancy because I was starting to get low back and round ligament pain. It was ok until I started getting a little bigger (around month 7). It was a bit of a pain to get on, it made my shoulders ache after wearing it for awhile, and it caused me to have weird fat bulges between the straps on my sides, very unattractive. I stopped using it and wished I had just bought one of those simple ones that is just a single strap that wraps around your back and under your belly.
