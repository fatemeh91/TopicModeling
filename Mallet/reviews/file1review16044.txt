review/text: I first started using Thorne vitamins 18 years ago when my first child was born. When you have little kids, every possible bug comes home, and the first month my child went to daycare, he got bronchitis, and my husband got pneumonia. His mother found the vitamins and started bringing them to us. Amazing; with two children in daycare and working long hours in crowded offices--think Amazon in the Columbia building--I survived exposure to other people's colds, sleep deprivation, stress, all the conditions that run down working parents. I switched to the Meta-Fem when I was 42, after years of taking Basic Nutrients IV. To this day I believe I am healthier and more resilient as a result of these vitamins. I swear by them, and I tell all women to take them. One word of warning; they are strong and cannot easily be tolerated on an empty stomach!
