review/text: Initially, this thing works great. Holds a charge, does its job, etc. But after only 22 months the batteries no longer hold a charge for more than a few seconds. Nothing else is worn out and there's no way to replace the battery yourself. I think a ~$30 trimmer should last longer than that.
