review/text: My wife splintered a bone in her hand. After the cast was taken off, she had trouble keeping her hand warm for doing exercises for rehab. The gloves work great. She was wearing them at night and it allowed more flexibility in the mornings when she got up which really helped her with rehab exercises. She only needed them for about a month and she would highly recommend them.
