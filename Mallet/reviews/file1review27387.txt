review/text: At the current rate of $53 with tax/shipping, this is the cheapest quality protein powder I've found. 33.37 grams per dollar. It has extremely low fat and carbs as well, which makes it easy to control those factors as desired. I mixed one scoop with one ice cube, 1% milk, half a banana, two tablespoons of crunch peanut butter. It's really a dessert and doesn't upset my stomach like some other brands I have tried.
