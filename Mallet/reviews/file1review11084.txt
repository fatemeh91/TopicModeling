review/text: A long time ago, I had taken garlic supplements but I got some pretty fierce heartburn from it.Recently I had a lingering cold that I just could not shake. A friend of mine is into whole food health so I asked him about natural anti-biotics. Garlic, he says, is that and a lot more including some anti-histamine like qualities (I was sniffling a lot).The health food store owner recommended this brand because of the enteric coating.Amazing! Killed my lingering cold and all symptoms. I felt great. No heartburn. No garlic smell after taking the pill.I don't take it every day, that is true. However, we currently have the plague sweeping through the office and so far I have been able to stay away from it - I think it is this supplement that is making the difference.Darin
