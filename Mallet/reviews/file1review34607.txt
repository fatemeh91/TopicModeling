review/text: DentaPicks are so great for cleaning between teeth (even when they had braces on them) that my dental hygenist swears I must floss several times each day. The picks have no flavor but a mint taste could be nice. I've used these things for many years but am now having a difficult time finding them. If you can find them for sale, buy several containers; I know I will.
