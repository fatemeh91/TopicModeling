review/text: Update: The crappy packaging has been changed. Instead of being in a cheapie lipstick-like container, it is now like a chap-stick tube. It feels like a much better quality now.Old Review:I have also tried many types of lip balm. This is by far the best for me. I usually get it at Whole Foods, but the bin has been empty for nearly a month. I might have to order it...yikes, I cannot live without this stuff. My lips are starting to go all to he**.
