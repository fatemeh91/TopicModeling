review/text: because we absolutely love it! We tried many seats with our oldest son (3) and this is his favorite, hands down! We have one upstairs and one downstairs and I am purchasing this one to send to his preschool. It is so easy to use and clean. He can put the seat on and take it off by himself. I cannot recommend this seat highly enough!
