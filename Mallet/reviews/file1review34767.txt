review/text: I have been a loyal user of this deodorant for almost 10 years. It was great stuff.For some reason, they decided to completely reformulate it. It's still OK, but I don't like the new smell. It's sort of medicine-y. It also doesn't seem to stave off BO quite as well as the original formula. I guess I'll be on the hunt for something new. This is the first time I recall ever being disappointed by something Aubrey Organics made.For the new ingredient list, see their website. The list above (first ingredient: rose water) is no longer correct.
