review/text: I researched carefully before I tried this product. I also compared it to many other comparable "brain-multi's" available.It has a stellar combination of many scientifically proven nootropics-in good ratios.The "subscribe & save" price specifically is an incomparable price-per-pill,if you compare tablets-per-bottle and milligrams of each ingredient to other brands' single ingredients--like I did. [because I'm an insufferable geek]I am an adult in my 40's, with diagnosed ADHD [combined type], chronic Migraine, and previous head trauma.I wanted this product to help with memory, attention, impulsivity,and protection/prevention of cognitive decline.I am extremely sensitive to medications, suffering nausea and migraines from even normal multi-vitamins.With this product: no nausea, no flushing, no racing heart. No increase in Migraines.[I do take only 1 pill daily, instead of the recommended 4)I have been using Higher Mind, in conjunction with a low-glycemic Mediterranean diet, and daily exercise.Subsequently, I have been able to stop taking anti-depressants for the first time in 18 years.(I DO still use a minimal amount of time-release ADHD medication, for my deficits are pronounced)However, I believe there are gradual, long term benefits to still be had from Higher Mind...especially from the ingredient Huperzine A.I recommend this product highly, not as a magic bullet, but as a very smart way to give your brain a HEALTHY helping hand--allowing the brain to operate at its best, and to heal itself. If used wisely, this will greatly augment holistic health measures, without sending you into overdrive.The broad types of ingredients included allows me to decrease the amount of vitamin bottles I tend to juggle; thus saving me money, and ensuring I "remember" to take all the types I need.The pill is larger, but it's not been any issue. Its surface has a salty taste.from the product website:"Higher Mind addresses the multiple, interdependent body systems necessary for healthy brain function: neurotransmitter production, cell membrane stability, energy generation, antioxidant defense and myelin sheath generation. This Bio-Aligned Formula features phosphatidyl serine, a phospholipid that is an essential component of nerve cell membranes. These membranes conduct electrical impulses that promote communication between nerve cells, contributing to healthy cognitive function."
