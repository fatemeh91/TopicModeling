review/text: This is a really nice bar for massages. The girls at my local Lush store love to push it as a lotion bar in addition to massages. This is not so. It is too oily for lotion purposes.I do love the scent. It is fresh and light. It soothes and relaxes. I do love the way it makes massages feel. This bar even has fun spots to stick your fingers while using it on your partner. You will need a good shower after the massage unless your skin is super dry. Also one thing to note is a little bit goes a long way. Do not use this bar to massage just use it to spread the oil where needed.
