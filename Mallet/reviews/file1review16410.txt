review/text: I used to be in bed for almost a week every time I came down with the flu, and was feeling so sick and weak for so long that the thought of death seemed welcome at times. Then I started using Oscillo. I use it whenever I feel the first symtoms that point to flu, and I have had some very mild flu symptoms but have NEVER since had the flu like I used to 15 or more years ago. This works! Homeopathy is not voodoo. I feel much better knowing that I have Oscillo handy at all times, and I do not plan to get a flu shot again this year. I am planning to add astragalus (herbal antiviral) since it has been recommended by Dr. Weil and can be used indefinitely as a preventive measure.
