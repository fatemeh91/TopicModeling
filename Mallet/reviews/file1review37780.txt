review/text: I had heard a LOT of talk about this deodorant. Turns out it really was all talk. it's 25% ALUMINUM so when you apply it you literally begin to start to smell like -metal-. that seeps into your skin and can cause all sorts of reactions. This deodorant worked great the FIRST TIME I used it. however, every subsequent time AFTER is just didn't cut it. I'm back to square one.
