review/text: I've been using whey protein for a few months and have noticed some positive gains in muscle mass. I originally used another brand but with so many people giving positive reviews here and on youtube, I decided to buy Optimum Nutrition's Whey Protein Gold Standard and I really like it. The flavor I chose was Extreme Milk Chocolate thanks in large part to another reviewer who said it was the best of the chocolate flavors and he's so right. It tastes a lot like Nestle's Quik and I really like that. I use 1 scoop for breakfast and blend it with milk, 1 banana and some low fat plain yogurt for a nutritious smoothie. Then I go jogging 1 hour after breakfast and in the afternoon I work out and lift weights and for my post workout meal I make the exact same shake once again. I really prefer ON's Gold Standard Whey Protein because it's a trusted brand I trust, the shipping is free on Amazon (and no tax, woohoo!) and because it plain and simply works.I purchased the 5 lb tub and will definitely buy another one after it finishes. Tastes good and works. 'Nuff said.
