review/text: Back buddy is definitely my new buddy!It can reach all the places that are hard to get on your ownwithout a massage therapist. Whomever invented this is a genius!The different shaped nobs (one more round, one more pointed)are really great and can totally relieve painful trigger points.So glad I found this!
