review/text: I've been using these for sevral years and havent been able to find them in stores anymore.I've read some reviews saying they're like scotch tape..wow.As long as you follow the directions, esp. make sure you wash your face very well, these will never fail you! I have VERY thick, VERY wide brows normally.I have them done in a salon every few months but I love using these in between, they keep my brows perfect.I always do a little tweezing here and there but with my brows it's a must.These little stickers remove (on one strip) ALL hair they touch w/ the exception of 1-2 here & there and like i said, my hair is THICK.Just wash the area really good and you shouldnt have any problems!
