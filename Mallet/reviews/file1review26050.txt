review/text: We bought this for my father. He is considered the "Father Time" of the family. Right now, he is on kidney dialysis and cannot wear a watch on his wrist any longer. The selling point was that when it is pressed it will speak the time. We only saw the picture via Amazon and had no idea what to expect! The watch had arrived within great timing for Father's Day and we left it in its box until then.When it was opened, what a surprise we received. The watch is a brilliant color gold and its chain is perfectly done in gold also. The instructions were very easy to read and my father had a great time setting it. We listened to the chimes it comes with several times and all agreed the "Rooster" was our favorite. The hands are black and in bold print, they make it easy to see the time. The watch has different settings for viewing the time: one can listen to the time on the hour, just press the necessary button to hear the time, or just simply view the watch to see the time. The alarm on the watch was easy to set as well.My father just cannot wait to use it when he visits his dialysis center and give the nurses a treat! As we stated above, this is the perfect gift for anyone who is looking for something fashionable, easy to use, and not for the wrist. Also, the "Rooster" chime is a hoot!!!!!Hope this helps!God Bless and Enjoy!!! :)))
