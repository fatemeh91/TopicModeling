review/text: The Berman Center Isis Begining Pelvic Exercisor truely is easy to use. It also has a comfortable shape and size plus it comes with a cute drawstring pouch for convienant storage. The package has easy to follow diagrams with easy to read instructions. The one drawback I found with the packageing is trying to find the instructions hidden among the other words on the package, but once found they are easy to understand.
