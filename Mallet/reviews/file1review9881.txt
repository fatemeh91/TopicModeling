review/text: I wish this came a day sooner to help get an ingrown out but when it did arrive i was able to pluck the ingrown easily. Much better than typical tweezers. I get a lot of ingrowns so i needed a tweezers that would get those fine hairs that i could see but couldnt pluck with other tweezers. These do the job great. Be very careful because they have a very fine point. I did notice they sell these at Bed Bath Beyond(use your 20% coupon).
