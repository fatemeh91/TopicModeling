review/text: If you are tired of the "sporty" and "fresh" scents filling the shelves of your local supermarket, and want something a little more "manly", then this could be the deodorant for you. It's a great, clean, truly masculine scent that will leave you smelling like a man, not a boy.But who cares if it smells great if it doesn't work? Cast your concerns aside, Speed Stick works great at controlling odor. Mind you, this is not an antiperspirant, and as such is aluminum free.The new look and formula removes triclosan from the ingredients list, a GOOD thing!Per the FDA, triclosan is "an ingredient added to many consumer products to reduce or prevent bacterial contamination", but "does not have evidence that triclosan in antibacterial soaps and body washes provides any benefit over washing with regular soap and water" [1,2].What does this mean for you? Well, with recent health concerns over triclosan, that means that it's inclusion in this product may not necessarily be necessary to provide any additional benefit. As an antibiotic, triclosan has been linked to hormone disruption, and the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria [3]. The Canadian Medical Association has even asked for a ban on triclosan [4]. The American Medical Association suggests removing triclosan from your home, which also prevents runoff and accumulation into soil, groundwater, lakes, and streams where triclosan is toxic to wildlife [5]. Water treatment does not fully remove triclosan.1. FDA, "Triclosan: What Consumers Should Know"2. WebMD, "FDA Panel: No Advantage to Antibacterial Soap"3. CBC News, "Toxic chemical monitoring program gets $500M"4. The Globe and Mail, "Experts concerned about dangers of antibacterial products"5. Environmental Working Group, "Pesticide in Soap, Toothpaste and Breast Milk - Is It Kid-Safe?: EWG's Guide to Triclosan"So all in all, a pretty good product, reformulated to remove a chemical compound under scrutiny for lack of beneficial evidence.
