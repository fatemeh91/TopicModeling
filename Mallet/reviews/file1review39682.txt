review/text: I have been using a Flossaid for about four years now and ordered a spare for my kit and a fresh one for my wife. Since I started using it religiously every day four years ago I haven't had a single dental problem. My dentist marvels at how much better my teeth and gums are now. Once you install a long piece of floss it is easy to use and certainly saves the fingers from getting squeezed uncomfortably as in the traditional method. This product pays for itself many times over if you use it.
