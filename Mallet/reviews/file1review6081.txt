review/text: I had been buying the "RAGS IN A BOX", which are superior in quality and usefulness. I decided to give these a try and I really LOVE them!!! Theyre super tough, easy to start the first towel through the dispensing top and rugged in every way you use them....yet soft enough to wipe my sensitive face! NOW THAT'S A PERFECT TOWEL! You will not be disappointed by these towels. Like Mikey for the Life cereal commercial used to say......."try it, you'll like it!"
