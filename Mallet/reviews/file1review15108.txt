review/text: I LOVE patchouli (or patchouly as they spell it), so when I saw this incense at my health food store, I decided to try it. I just got done buring it less than an hour ago. It's a great incense. Each stick burns for about an hour, and the scent is pleasant and very strong (take the advice on the package and make sure you open a window if you are in a small room!). Patchouli is a very relaxing scent, and I found that this incense combined with relaxing music really helped to clear my mind. As a vegetarian, I also like the fact that this incense contains no animal byproducts. I'll definately be buying more of this incense in the future.
