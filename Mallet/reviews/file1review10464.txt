review/text: Tums Smoothie, Extra Strength Antacid/Calcium Supplement 750, Cocoa & Creme , 60 Count. I looked and looked to see how many bottles of these I would receive for the price. Apparently, only one. I found a bottle of the same thing at Walmart (finally) last month for about $5.00. Apparently, the vendor is making a healthy profit on these. I put the Extra Strength orange sugar free Tums on my wish list until I get to Walmart to see if they still have the chocolate Smoothie. You can get 4 bottles of 80 count each of the orange chewables for $21.96. Two stars because of the price.
