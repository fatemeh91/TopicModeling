review/text: Since I've been plagued with loose bowels for many years ,the doctor's assistant recommended Benefiber to give me some bulk.I have take taking two teaspooons three times a day in hot tea and so far I haven't noticed any improvemet.IN fact, my bowels are even looser.I'll take it a couple more days in case my body needs to get used to it and see if there is any change.This time I just bought a small size to try out to see if it would work.Other than taking anti diarreal pills I don't know what else to do. I know I don't get as much fiber in my diet as I should but I do try to get some in every day.
