review/text: So my husband and I were going on a cruise for the first time for our anniversary, and while we were really excited, my husband was a little nervous about getting motion sick. You have to understand my husband gets motion sick in a car, on a boat, on a treadmill, on a plane, on the Indiana Jones ride in Disneyland! I ordered a bunch of stuff. He tried these drops once but the solution itself smells bad. Its like a weird herbal smell... He put on the psi bands right away so we dont really know how effective the drops were. The Psi Bands, and Sea Bands worked better for him.
