review/text: I have a friend who accidently packed his wife's "chick" blade when he went on a business trip and he figured what the heck I'll try it. Said it was the best shave he ever had and he has stuck to "chick" blades ever since. I decided to try it. These blades are better/last longer than the ones for men. Much smoother, less irritating. I've been using them for several years now. I have stuck with the old fashioned skinny handle though. :)
