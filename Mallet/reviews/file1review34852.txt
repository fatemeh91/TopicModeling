review/text: Since receiving a warning from my physician that I was approaching Fatty Liver disease two years ago, I have been taking two Livatone Caps and two Livatone Plus Caps daily. For me, these caps make a positive difference in how I feel--the heaviness on my right side is gone and my digestion is greatly improved. Of course, the fact that I have just about eliminated unnecessary fats and sugars from my diet helps and I now have enough energy to alternate between fast walks and bicycle riding six days of the week. I am 61 and the 20-somethings can't keep up! These caps are far better than anything one could purchase from drugstores and in my opinion are well worth the money.
