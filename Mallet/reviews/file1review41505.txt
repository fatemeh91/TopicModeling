review/text: This is my second order for the Panasonic CR2354 battery. The first order was on Dec 5, 2011 from NationalDeals. The battery arrived quickly but was dated 95 on the negative side of the cell.The second order was on Nov 18, 2012 from MyBatterySupplier and arrived quickly as well (Nov 23, 2012). The cells were much fresher than the others but were still dated 07 on the negative side.The fit my Vortex Sparc just fine and despite the age of the cells they last quite a bit longer than the no name cell that came with the Sparc. I will be purchasing them again as needed.
