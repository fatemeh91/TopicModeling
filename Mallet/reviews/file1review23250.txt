review/text: My 9 month old is very afraid of the vacuum, so every time I need to my husband has to take him outside until I am finished. By using this handy little sweeper, I can clean up any loose dirt in his play area everyday and I only have vacuum once a week. It works well on our hardwood, tile, and carpet!
