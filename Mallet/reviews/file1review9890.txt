review/text: It's great at digging hairs out from underneath skin, but not so good at grasping hairs once they have emerged. It tends to break them off instead of pulling them out by the root. That's problematic, because you are supposed to remove ingrown completely -- meaning I have to use these to get the hair, and then another, duller pair to remove it :)
