review/text: These are terrible. The blades are the cheapest things imaginable -- so blunt that they leave nails ragged, making it even more likely that your baby will accidentally scrape himself with his nails. And the rounded edges make it nearly impossible to use them on the tiniest nails. And they are larger than regular adult nail scissors, which I now use on my baby instead of these.Don't be fooled as I was by the fact that they're marketed as baby nail scissors. Nothing about these scissors suggests they were actually designed to be the safest thing to use on a baby's delicate, small nails. The only thing about them that says "baby" is the (admittedly cute) butterfly design. If all you care about is how they look in your medicine cabinet, these will do fine. If you actually want to use the scissors, definitely get something else.
