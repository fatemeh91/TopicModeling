review/text: Before buying this brush used dishes and pots would languish in the sink. I would clean them when I got a chance, but I was the only one cleaning while others were still contributing. What an odd phenomenon!Then one day I discovered thismagic dish brush! Not only do others clean their dishes more often, but I do too. It's easy to clean one messy item or a counter full with this little godsend. Added bonus: it floats in a sink (or stock pot) full of water even when it's full of soap! Refilling is a breeze, and after a month of regular usage (multiple times a day) the bristles still look new! I'd thought thereplaceable bristle headswould be more "consumable," but I've been pleasantly surprised.No staining, no foul smells, no leaking. Tough enough to clean my pots and pans (nonstick, if that's pertinent) even if they've been sitting for days but gentle enough to use on my stemware. I'm going to be gifting these little dishmates of wonder. No kitchen should be without one. I wish I had one in college! Another potential gifting idea? YES!I love this thing. :)[edit] It's now been about 7 months since I got my scrubber, and I'm just now thinking I should get some of thosereplacement bristle heads. I just wish the Amazon price would come back down! If not, I'll probably take a 20% off coupon to my local Bed, Bath, & Beyond since they have them for $3.99 right now. I'm also wishing this optionwith the storage dishwas available when I ordered mine!
