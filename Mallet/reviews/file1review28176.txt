review/text: Started on Optimum Nutrition when I began to take protein supplements. Changed to a GNC-espoused brand when I couldn't find ON at my local grocery store. When I found ON Whey on Amazon, I knew it was an easy decision because of Amazon's great service, the quality difference between ON and the GNC-pimped brand, and the price. I'm sticking with Amazon for my supplement needs.
