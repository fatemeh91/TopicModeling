review/text: I had lasik in December, and was given several samples of drops to use a few times daily to ease the recovery process. My doctor mentioned as well that continual use of drops helps lessen regression-- as my prescription was terrible and brought back to 20/20, I certainly hope that's true! Optive was my favorite of the drops I was given, and this box of 2 15ml bottles is a great value compared to getting these drops at the eye clinic (free samples notwithstanding). I've been using them a few times in the evenings, when I start to notice my eyes are dry and my corneas are blurring up. Instant and lasting relief, and two months out from the procedure no regression yet!In addition, my husband has mild cat allergies. Since we got our tabby, he's started to use the drops once or twice an evening to help relieve his symptoms. He likes them enough to continue to do so daily even though he struggles a LOT with things coming near his eyes!
