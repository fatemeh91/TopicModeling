review/text: I really like this product. It seems to work better than most on my little guy's gums, but it takes FOREVER to use. Unlike most homeopathic products, it doesn't dissolve in his mouth. You have to dissolve it in water (or formula, or breast milk, or juice,) first. The directions tell you to dissolve it on a spoon with water. this can take up to 3 minutes to do and you end up loosing half the water (and I would imagine the medicine) in the feeding process. I generally end up putting it in his bottle and letting him get it that way. But it does work...well.
