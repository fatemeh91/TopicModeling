review/text: And so do my teeth. My hygienist has given me good marks even when I've been late on getting my teeth professionally cleaned! In the past, I've tried the Sonicare but found the toothbrush sort of big and clumsy (I gather that they have corrected this problem -- but I'm a devoted Oral B fan so ..............).
