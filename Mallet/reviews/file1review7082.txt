review/text: I bought this for my husband, and he has really enjoyed it. It provides a smooth transition from shaving with a blade, and is easy on the face. Fully charged, it lasts about a week, and is not bulky or inconvenient to leave out while charging. His favorite feature is that he can choose how close it will shave. It's also very easy to clean and easy to take on trips.
