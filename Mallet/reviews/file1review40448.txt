review/text: This amazing balm saved me from chapped lips from hell. Over the last week, my lips became inexplicably, painfully chapped - almost as if they'd been badly irritated by a caustic substance. Yeah, it's winter, it's dry, but this was unlike any other chapped lip experience I've had.I tried a couple of balms I had around, but they just aggravated the situation with menthol, mint, camphor, menthol, peppermint or whatever gets put into these things to give you that cool, zippy feeling. Horrible, painful, made things much worse. I longed for just a bland, gentle ointment that would soothe and moisturize, but my lips continued to burn and the skin just kept tightening and flaking. My lips were bright red.I finally found Karite-Lips, and the healing began. I can't express how relieved I was to put something on my lips that didn't sting, but just soothed and calmed my tortured, painful skin. The vanilla scent is perfect, the shea butter is amazing, and my lips are finally starting to heal.Worth every single penny.
