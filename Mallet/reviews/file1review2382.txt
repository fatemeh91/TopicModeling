review/text: Although my Lasik procedure was a success, the experience left visibly red veins across the whites of my eyes which have not faded even after a year's time. Based on the other reviews here I began taking this supplement at the recommended dose of 3/day hoping that it would reduce the redness in my eyes. Prior to this I had been taking a single fish oil pill/day.While the redness of my eyes did appear visibly reduced over time, I began to experience a baffling side effect where, with my mouth wide open in mid-yawn, my jaw would suddenly and unpredictably "lock" open. I had to push and prod the side of my jaw for minutes at a time before things would pop back into realignment and I could close my mouth. For a couple of weeks I had no idea what was happening and was about to go see a doctor before I put two and two together. I immediately ceased taking the supplement and it hasn't happened since.Probably not a typical reaction bit I'll stick to regular (low dosage) fish oil for now.
