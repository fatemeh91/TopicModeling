review/text: I am in the 3rd trimester of my 2nd pregnancy and needed something to support me while I chased my toddler, took walks, and cleaned the house. The first time I put the cradle on it seemed like it wasn't tight enough to make much of a difference. I am quite short (under 5'-- I have a hell of a time getting maternity anything to fit me properly) and the over-the-shoulder straps felt too loose. However, after I wore it all day to run errands on foot (walked quite a bit) and took my son to the playground, I noticed a considerable difference from the previous times I had done the same amount of activity without the cradle. To my delight, the usual pains that I felt after sitting a while at the end of the day and the next morning were not there. I would definitely recommend this product to other pregnant women.
