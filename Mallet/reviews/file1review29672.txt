review/text: I purchased this item based on Avent being associated with high quality products. That is not the case with these pads. They are not very absorbant, especially for nighttime use, are too bulky to wear under anything but an extra large sweatshirt, and worst of all they stick to your nipples, increasing dryness, cracking and bleeding. It is a wonderful idea being able to reuse them, but not a workable one. I recently tried Johnson's disposables that are extremely absorbant and the pad and leakage do not stick!
