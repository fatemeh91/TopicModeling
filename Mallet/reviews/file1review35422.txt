review/text: We had a weird yucky smell from dishwasher and tech said to get this stuff as it cleans it out. He was right as he was an expert. It brought a lot of the scum out that we could then wipe it off all around to get it more clean. Stock up on several to use every few months as its nice to keep your dishwasher clean as stuff gets trapped in the closed part that you can't get to easily.
