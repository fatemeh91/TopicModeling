review/text: I've tried the french vanilla creme & double rich chocolate but my fav has to be chocolate mint! I put it in a blender bottle with 7 oz of water only so the drink gets thick not too watery! It will taste good if you like mint chocolate. As for the quality, you can't go wrong with Optimum nutrition products!
