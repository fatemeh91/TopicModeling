review/text: I've been taking DIM-plus for about 10 months. I ordered it because I was experiencing night sweats, hot flashes and difficulty sleeping. Within a few weeks my symptoms improved greatly. After a few months I stopped taking it, and the symptoms returned. I won't be without it from now on.
