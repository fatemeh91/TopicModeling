review/text: After back surgery, I needed more support for my back and this is the answer! Since it is inflatable, it is easy to get a perfect fit. Heavy-duty product material, and great price. I am using this product eight to ten hours a day, and it is comfortable and stable throughout the day. I highly recommend it! Very fast shipping also!Back Booster 1001 Inflatable Lumbar Support Cushion
