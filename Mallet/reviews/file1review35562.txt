review/text: While they are very complete there are too many negatives to make them worth to me. First you need to take them twice a day now while this may not be a problem for some people this proved to be too much of a hassle for me I'd always forget my morning dose. Second, they are VERY fishy! Even hours after I'd take them I could still taste the fish oil. With my already queasy stomach I just couldn't bear to do it anymore. I am now taking prescription Natelle Plus with DHA and much prefer those.
