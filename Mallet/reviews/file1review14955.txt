review/text: Earthrise Californian Spirulina has a great fresh taste, it's super dark green-blue color makes it feels it's 100% pure. I have it every morning mixed with rice milk, and it keeps me energized the entire day. I recomend, for $33.00 is a great deal for this amazing food!Earthrise Spirulina Natural, 454 Grams Powder
