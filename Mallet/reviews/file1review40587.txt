review/text: I have done about a dozen dishwasher loads over this past Thanksgiving weekend. In the middle of it, I ran out of the Seventh Generation stuff and switched to this. Wow, what an improvement! Since I have softened water, I never use a full dispenser of soap. After reading the directions, I only use 1/3 of a dispenser of this stuff. The dishes and glasses were noticeably cleaner with the Earth Friendly Wave than the Seventh Generation, and right in the same ballpark as the Cascade Complete I used to use. The glasses in particular were film-free. If some are seeing a residue, I suspect this is due to over-filling the dispenser. This is a concentrated cleaner and doesn't need as much. Try 1/2 or even 1/3 full.
