review/text: Pros1) The product has everything I need in it, at the ratios I need them at. (Calorie v Protein count, BCAA's, essential aminos)2) This whey blends great with everything, and leaves little to no clumping even when spoon mixed.Cons1) Acesulfame potassium is used as a sweetener.2) The cookies and creme flavor doesn't quite taste OR smell right. Try a different flavor.
