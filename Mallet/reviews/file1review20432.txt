review/text: I'm in a car 8-10 hours a day and the seat in the car stinks! I was looking for some relieve for my butt and hips. This cushion sure helps and the cutout for the tailbone is a life saver. However, I'm far from big (5'10" 172lbs) and I can tell this is starting to get a little flat already after 3 weeks of use. I still have too shift around frequently to relieve the pressure on my rear, but it is better with this cushion.
