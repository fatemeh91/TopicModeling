review/text: I've had some tendinitis in my left elbow and even extended rest has not helped. I finally tried this Magnetic Elbow Support and in 2-3 weeks I have seen a major improvement in my elbow. I can now workout my triceps without pain or stiffness and I'm thinking about purchasing a knee support as well and see if that will help with my knee pain.If you have tendinitis or tennis elbow problems I would highly recommend this magnetic support. $25 is a small price to pay for pain relief.
