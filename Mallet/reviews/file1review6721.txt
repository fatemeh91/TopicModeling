review/text: The Body Back Buddy is just as advertised. Firm light weight plastic construction. The design allows you to reach and manipulate muscles with very little effort because you can get plenty of leverage from different angles you don't need to apply a lot of pressure with your arms to get great results. It comes with a helpful booklet to help you discover how to reach and massage many muscle groups including the feet! It does provide quick self relief without having to give someone else instructions as to more or less pressure or up, down right or left. I'm very pleased with mine.
