review/text: At first, I was apprehensive about following the directions for uisng Lavilin.I probably wouldn't have, except I had cousins who had been using it. They kept describing Lavilin as "nicer" than other deodorants. They didn't smell bad, and he worked out a lot at the time. They explained that you used it at night and washed it in the morning. The worker in the shop where I first bought it explained the procedure in more detail. Still, no one had warned me about the three day waiting period. Well, that's all history now.I've been using Lavilin for more than 15 years, and I wouldn't go back to daily deodorant. It is much more convenient, and as someone else mentioned, it works by killing bacteria that cause odors, not by covering up odors.By the way, Lavilin seems to work longer the longer you use it.
