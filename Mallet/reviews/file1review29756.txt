review/text: I have a Bravado nursing bra, and the Avent pads are too thick and too small in diameter. They don't stay in place, they're bulky and they don't absorb as much as the Medela pads. I also don't like that they stick to my nipples, and that they have lace on one side so you can't flip them over if they get a little damp and you're not able to change them. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more money to get the Medela reusables. I should also mention (as I wish that someone had told me as a new mom) that you tend to leak a ton at first, so the Lansinoh disposables are the way to go, then you can switch to reusables after a few weeks when you don't leak as much.
