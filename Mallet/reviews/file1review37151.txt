review/text: I got these because I work with my hands, and after a few particularly grueling days, my left hand (I'm left-handed) was too sore to be of much use. After wearing these gloves for just three or four hours the day after I'd injured myself, I could already tell a difference in my left hand. I wore them to bed that night. The next day, I was able to make a tight fist without any discomfort at all. No more sausage fingers.It's always better to prevent a repetitive stress injury than have to deal with one later, but if such an injury happens to you, these gloves are a big help in the recovery phase.Lastly, a heads-up: these aren't carpal tunnel gloves. I notice in the pamphlet that came with my gloves that Swede-O/Thermoskin has a separate type of glove for that.
