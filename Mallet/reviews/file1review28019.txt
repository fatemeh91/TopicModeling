review/text: The only other protein powder I've had was from Whole Foods and was pretty chalky & meh. This stuff is awesome. Plain and simple, it's really good. Great deal with subscribe and save. My co-worker loves the cookies and cream one, the only other I've tried is the vanilla, which was not that great. I bought the extreme milk chocolate and have made it with water (in Sundesa shaker cup) and milk/banana (in blender). It's actually pretty great with just water, but obviously better with milk and fruit. Highly recommended.
