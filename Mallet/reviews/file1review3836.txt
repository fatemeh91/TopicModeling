review/text: I tried this tea because I am an insomniac, and wanted something to help put me to sleep. Unfortunately, I can barely palette this tea because of its wretched last note and after-taste of Stevia. I have never tasted Stevia before, but after reading the other reviews I instantly knew that was the issue. It goes into my throat and just tastes disgustingly sweet. Not in a good way, either.I don't usually put sugar or milk in any of my tea-- I am one of those people who drinks strong black chais straight up. So this is a complete killer for me. If you like super sweet teas, this may be for you, but I don't understand why they would put a sweetener in their tea. If they're going to do that, perhaps they should make a separate version without the Stevia.I won't be purchasing this again, and I continue my hunt for very strong sleepytime teas that aren't sweet, fruity, or minty.
