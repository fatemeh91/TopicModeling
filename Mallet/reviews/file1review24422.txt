review/text: According to their measurements, I was supposed to get size E. They weren't comfortable, so I asked my chiropractor who suggested I get these. He stated that their measurements are wrong & that I should get size J or K. He had extras.I sent them back to the location that was included in the box, but I haven't received them. I'm hoping I get them shortly, but it's now been 3 weeks.
