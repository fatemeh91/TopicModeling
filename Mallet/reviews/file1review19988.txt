review/text: I'm always excited to try all the new toothpastes this company carries. They are all pretty mild toothpastes that actually leave your mouth feeling wonderfully fresh and clean.This particular toothpaste contains calcium for clean teeth and zinc citrate (a naturally occurring mineral) to help prevent plaque that can lead to gingivitis. Gingivitis of course is a disease of the gums that occurs when plaque accumulates on the teeth and produces toxins and irritants that make your gums red and puffy.This toothpaste helps to stop the plaque from forming in the first place. It is also fluoride-free because this company respects their customer's needs. This is also naturally flavored with pure peppermint oils and doesn't contain saccharin, so it is not as sweet as otherproducts.Active Ingredients: 2% Zinc citrate trihydrateInactive Ingredients: Calcium Carbonate, Glycerin, Water, Xylitol, Chamomile Extract, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Peppermint Oil, Carrageenan, Sodium Bicarbonate, Myrrh GumA Cruelty Free & Biodegradable Product! After all, rabbitsdon't need to have their teeth brushed! So there! I loveusing cruelty free products because I know I have notcontributed to cruel testing experiments on little bunnies.Thanx Kate and Tom for another great product!Other companies to look for if you care about Animal Testingare: Avalon Active Organics and Zia Natural Skin Care.~The Rebecca Review
