review/text: So I just had a very painful BM. This just came in the mail too, so I decided to use it... and give it a chance since TUCKS witch hazel doesn't really work for me...Usually after a painful BM, it's really hard to sit..because it's just painfully burning and so sore...After using it, I don't really feel that much of a pain, it's still there but to the point it doesn't bother me!THIS IS SERIOUSLY A MIRACLE! I can now sit still!!!!!!! Highly recommended :)
