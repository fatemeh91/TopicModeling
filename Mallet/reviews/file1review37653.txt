review/text: I've always liked the scent of Old Spice Cologne but never had the discipline to use it on a daily basis. Old Spice Deodorant now allows me an easy way to apply something once a day and get the Old Spice scent. The packaging was easy to open and the red color should be easy to spot on the store shelf. I'll definitely use it again.
