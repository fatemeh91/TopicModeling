review/text: This is the best-smelling, least-irritating deodorant product I have ever used. Unfortunately the tradeoff for me is that it only lasts a few hours. If you perspire little, and tend to get irritation from strong deodorant, this might be the perfect product for you. If you perspire a lot (like me), and have to be around people a lot during the day (like me), you'll probably want to find something stronger.
