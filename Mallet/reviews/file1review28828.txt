review/text: Don't be fooled by the size of this container. When I opened this whey drink, the container was only half full. I paid for shipping empty plastic and that ticks me off. Yeah, I know the "contents may settle in transport" cop out. But if it had not been fluffed before it was shipped; this container would be smaller and more convenient to use.The whey drink has a slightly bitter over taste, which is strange as I've never known whey protein to be bitter. It is the usually cloyingly sweet. I doubt there's much to be done about that though.If you come from a dairy farm as I do, then you are prepared for whey protein to smell like the milk replacer used when calves are weaned. This doesn't have that taste and odor and I was happily surprised at that. I have had bariatric surgery and I need to drink at least 20 grams of protein a day without raising my blood glucose too high. So far this product looks like it will meet that requirement.
