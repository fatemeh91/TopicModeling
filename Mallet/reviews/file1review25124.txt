review/text: The price was great (it was $40.00 cheaper than buying from a medical store).It did, however, stop working after three days and I was worried that I was out the money because last Christmas I ordered a cookbook for my granddaughter and it never arrived. When I went to the Amazon Web Site, there was no link to get any help.Fortunately, this time there was a link for help. The medical department not only got back to me within three days, they replaced it at no additional cost.Also, someone at Amazon noticed my displeasure with the book incident, and a replacement was mailed and I received it (ten months late, but I am happy that Amazon was on top of this issue).Thank you, Amazon, for the immediate response when you noticed there was a problem. Hopefully, this web site will stay active.I will definately order from you again.The unit works really well for those of us who have limited movement due to back fusion surgery.Mike Mulkey
