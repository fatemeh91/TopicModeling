review/text: Great product, works well. My bite guard never comes out of place. I sleep with it in the entire night. I spent a night in a hotel with my younger brother who made fun of me in the past for snoring loudly. On our recent three day, two night trip to Oakland, CA, my brother said he didn't hear me snore once. The guard keeps my mouth open and prevents me from grinding. I initially would get dry mouth, but after consistent use, I do not have that problem anymore. I figure if I have to use 2 of these every twelve months, it will be well worth the cost. RECOMMENDATION: My younger brother uses a professionally made bite guard and he recommended using just regular denture cleaning tablets on this mouth guard. I clean mine every three to four days and it cleans off all deposits, freshens it up, and I just follow directions on the denture cleaning tablet package. One could always be suspecting of online reviews. As for me, I have no complaints and I'll buy this product again.
