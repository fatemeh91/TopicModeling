review/text: I love this eye mask! I bought it last summer and use it every night. My husband likes to sleep with the TV on which prevents me from sleeping well. This mask blocks all light, doesn't touch my eyelids and works perfectly! I even wore it on an airplane to nap and thought it was fun that I could sit there with it on, my eyes open, and no one around me knew I was awake. I love it and I am back now to buy a few more to keep in case I can't find it when mine eventually wears out. I did find that the extra velco at the back got tangled in my hair each night so I just put a piece of cotton over it and that solved the problem. I did not find the bump at the back to be an issue, and I sleep on my back.
