review/text: As soon as i opened the packaging the on off button fell off - body was still attached to the packaging and I hadn't even touched it yet. I sent it back, could have been an outlier, but it felt cheap and I was not happy. Also the color is a bit fugly. I never used it so I can't comment on its usefulness, build quality was substandard.
