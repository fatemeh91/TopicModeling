review/text: Heck, who hasn't heard of K-Y Jelly? K-Y brand has been in the lubricant field since 1917!But, K-Y Liquid is a newer product. It is thinner than K-Y Jelly, and pours from a bottle (rather than being squeezed from a tube). K-Y Warming Liquid has a certain something in it that causes it to give a mild warming feeling on contact - this can be quite nice if you are prone to feeling cold, as I am.Overall, I found this to be a pretty good lubricant, and I liked the warming properties. Now, among its ingredients is "Acacia Honey," and some people say that it is more likely to cause a yeast infection than regular water-based lubricants. I haven't heard one way or another from anyone authoritative, and haven't experienced a yeast infection since I started using it, but you might want to keep that in mind. The worst downside to me, though, is the taste. If you use this stuff, and then get it into your mouth, you will find it to have an odd, bitter taste that is probably the ingredient trying to "warm" your tongue.So, I would say that this is a pretty good lubricant, one with a bad taste. So, if you are considering using this lubricant, you will have to decide if the balance of positives to negatives is worth it or not. Overall, I like it.FYI: In general, there are three types of lubricants and each has its pros and cons. Water-based lubes are easy to cleanup and are unlikely to cause yeast infections, but on the down side they do need to be renewed every half hour or less due to drying. Oil-based lubes tend to have maximum slipperiness and last longest, but can lead to yeast infections and tend to break down latex condoms and toys quite quickly. Silicone-based lubes fall in between these two, being slicker and longer lasting than water-based lubes, but they do require longer clean up times, can stain sheets and clothing, and will eventually break down silicone toys.(Review of K Y Warming Liquid - Creates a Gentle Warming Sensation on Contact, 1 oz)
