review/text: Been a longtime user of this item.... probably about 6+ years.I've tasted/tested/sampled every Chocolate whey protein powder product out there and this (Optimum Nutrition's Double Rich Chocolate) is by far the best tasting and mixes well with oatmeal or water. There is no artificial sweetener aftertaste like other protein powders. I haven't tried the other flavors as I'm a Chocolateholic.
