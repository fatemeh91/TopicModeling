review/text: This was our standard trauma dressing for the EMS service I worked providing 911 services for Orlando. I have used this trauma dressing myself dozens of times. In calls involving gunshot wounds or stabbings all I had to do was put this dressing on top of the wound and secure it with kling, haul ass to the hospital. Is very basic and simple. I am sure there is much better products but it did what was meant to do, stop the bleeding.
