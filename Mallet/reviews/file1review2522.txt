review/text: This is my first introduction to an epilator and I have mixed feelings about this one. It seems like some of the hairs just get cut off and it feels like your legs would feel two days afer shaving kind of thing. I've only used it twice so I'm not sure if I'm not doing it right or if the product is worthless. It's pretty cheap so I think it's worth a try, especially if it's your first time.
