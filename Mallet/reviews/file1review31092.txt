review/text: I don't write a negative review lightly, nor often. However when a product claims "40" uses, then notes it depends on so many variables, I would expect to get at least 4-5 uses our of a package of electrodes. I get 2-3 usesper set of 4.I have tried taking showers prior to usage allowing my body to completely dry. I have used Alcohol wipe prep pads to remove any oils from my skinjust prior to use assuring the skin is dry and clean. Yet, after the first use the edges start to lift up. The 3rd use a pad or two will not stick securely enough. When the pad does not adhere to the skin surface well you end up with the current arching slightly on the skin and this concentrates the charge in a small pinpoint location causing burningand discomfort.I even tried using the unit on my wife with a similar set of processes to ensure it was just not my body over producing skin oils or some other personal issue. Usage on my wife achieved similar results.A previous reviewer reviewed the dual channel (twin Stem TENS unit) and noted to "toss the included electrodes they are junk" and purchase an alternate suppliers electrodes for the unit. A package of 4 of these electrodes are included with the unit. Excellent advice, however since I can't find that review, I just asked my Physical Therapist which they used and ordered several pair. Much better. So my recommendation is ask your PT which ones they use and order them instead. They are "The cheapest pads around" for a reason. Avoid unless you can afford to toss them out after one use.
