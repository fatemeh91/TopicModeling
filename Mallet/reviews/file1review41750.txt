review/text: I have used Oral-B Power Toothbrushes for the last 15 years.This is the first one that really satisfies me.The biggest improvement is the LCD display that shows the actual battery status and when do you need to recharge it.So the times when you went for a weekend vacation and the battery is empty are gone.Another big improvement is the integrated travel charger and travel case. The base plate of the charging cradle can be removed and act as a small travel charger. This very handy if you travel a lot.The different brushing modes are a nice add-on, but not essentially needed in my opinion.Would i buy it again, yes every time.
