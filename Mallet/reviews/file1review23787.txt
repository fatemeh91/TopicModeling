review/text: My cholesterol was over 400 and drugs could only bring it down to 297. My doctor prescribed high doses of Lipitor, but this caused me to have headaches that would not go away. Other cholesterol drugs had similar (and worse effects) on me. Tests also showed early signs of liver disease (due to the medication).Next, I went to a naturopath and he "prescribed" ProFibe and told me to buy it on Amazon.com. After taking ProFibe for two weeks, my cholesterol went down to 190 and now hovers around 180. Since ProFibe is a food (made from citrus fiber and other natural ingredients), it regulates cholesterol the way nature intended it to be regulated. Unlike cholesterol drugs, ProFibe will not destroy your liver.My favorite way to take ProFibe is to mix one level teaspoon with a high protein chocolate shake (Muscle Milk, Premier Protein, etc) three to four times a day. ProFibe comes with a scoop (equal to 2 teaspoons), but I find that makes the beverage too grainy.How ProFibe works: ProFibe is a water-soluble fiber (WSF). ProFibe lowers cholesterol by preventing the reabsorption of bile acids. Bile acids are made from cholesterol, and after they aid fat digestion, ProFibe binds with them and escorts them out of the body. Then the liver has to pull more cholesterol from the blood (which reduces the LDL blood cholesterol). Without the ProFibe, the intestines would allow the cholesterol to be recycled back into the blood (which raises your blood cholesterol).After many years of controlled clinical trials, it was found that ProFibe lowers the total cholesterol and the bad cholesterol (LDL) without affecting the good cholesterol (HDL).ProFibe may also stabilize blood sugar by slowing down the absorption of carbohydrates into the blood. Plus, it can lower blood sugar levels. Researchers have found that increasing water-soluble fiber (such as ProFibe) intake results in a decrease in the body's need for insulin.Last but not least, ProFibe was developed by the medical school at the University of Florida. You can read more about ProFibe in the book Miracle Cures (by Jean Carper).
