review/text: I love this mirror. It is exactly what I had been looking for. The magnigication is excellent and it has 3 different light settings. The only small negative aspect is that the touch for the light settings is ultra sensitive and I will touch by mistake and turn the light off. Not really a big deal though. Great product.
