review/text: This is nothing more than a glorified energy pill..it's basically Red Bull in pill form.It will not magically make you lose weight...all it does is give you a boost of energy so you are able to push harder when exercising.The reason I take this is because due to longer work hours, I either have to go to the gym extra early or late at night, when I have no energy. Zantrex does an excellent job of getting me prepped up for the gym and giving me that extra boost so I can run an extra mile, or lift an extra set.....Take my word for it, Zantrex is useless if you DO NOT WORK OUT or have PROPER EATING HABITS. But if you want to go to a gym feeling like a mad bull charging a matador, this is it!
