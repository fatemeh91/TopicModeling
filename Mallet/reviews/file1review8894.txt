review/text: Does it do anything for me? I really do not know. But I add it to my protein shake for some additional nutritional value. I'm 55 and not particularly active but feel pretty good and I'm not sick or obese and have not gotten a cold in a while. I guess that's something! Ya gotta eat, this seems like a good choice in a shake.
