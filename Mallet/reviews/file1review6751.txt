review/text: I have fibromylagia, therefore I tend to be sore all the time. I am always desperate to ease the pain. Especially in my neck and shoulders. This gizmo really does the trick! I have problems with my hands, so I worried that it would be hard to hold onto, but it isn't. The Body Back Buddy really gives me the deep tissue pressure I need. I have taken to calling it my "boyfriend", because try as he might, my husband has never been able to work on my painful areas like this contraption can.If you have the need for deep pressure to release tight, sore, muscles I highly recommend this product!
