review/text: I have been using the Personal Touch for twenty five years. I have been using my last refill blade for months and finally went online to search for some more as I have been unable to find them anywhere. I am thrilled to find them on Amazon and had to read many of these great reviews to my husband to prove I am not the only one who thinks the PT is the best. He's been telling me it's too old and to find a new one. The new ones are horrible. Uncomfortable to hold on to and do not provide a close and nick free shave. You can shave as fast as you can go with the PT and still not nick yourself. Schick, bring back the Personal Touch!!!!!!!
