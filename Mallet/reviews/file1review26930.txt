review/text: This is the best tasting and most affordable whey protein product I've found. I don't really care about the bodybuilding thing any longer, but I like to supplement my protein intake and this is a nice sort of energy shot in the morning. On days when I can't make time for breakfast, this keeps me from getting light headed without stuffing myself with empty calories.It is artificially sweetened, but not over-the-top. Likely just enough to overcome the bitterness of the cocoa.I generally put a scoop in with cold coffee from the fridge and a splash of soy milk. If I do an intense weight session, I'll have another scoop either in almond milk or in the coffee concoction again.Note: I am mildly lactose intolerant and this stuff doesn't bother me at all.
