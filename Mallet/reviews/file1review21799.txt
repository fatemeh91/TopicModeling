review/text: I am an MD who has interest in alternative meds, so though I also find great value in standard pharmaceuticals.I find Dr. Sahelian's website very informative, but have to say that I am highly skeptical of his whole philosophy of very tiny amounts of herbs and nutrients working in synergy. But I chose to try this one and did it once for 6 weeks last summer, and again now for just a couple weeks.Both times very consistent effect of richer/brighter colors and more enjoyment of them. I stared at a sunset and my Xmas tree both yesterday for many minutes looking for subtle shades, etc.My nearsightedness is slightly better and appearance of floaters lightened a tad.So, dont expect drama here, but the color thing alone is kind of fun.Update: just went to eye doc and one eye is 60% better and other now normal in nearsightedness. This product was the only difference. eye doc said "this happens but it is very rare".Again I hav eno clue why or how this should work, but it does.
