review/text: If you like tall drinks and despair of finding adequate straws, these attractively colored straws make it easy to remember whose glass is whose, and are very functional for tropical or other tall drinks.I do wash them (since they're from China and we know how that's been lately) before I use them by running hot water through them.I would have to say that if I had my way, I would buy a large box of the long straws from Jack-in-the-Box, as they are a little larger in diameter and sturdier.Cheers
