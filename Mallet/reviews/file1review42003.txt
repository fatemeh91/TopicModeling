review/text: I was amazed how fast these got to me & to boot they don't expire until 2015! That's awesome considering I bought some this month off another vendor & they expire in Jan 2011...If colors are important to you, I'd think again though. I didn't get any green, pink or black ones. But let's be honest, it's not going to work any better/worse because it's not the color you want.
