review/text: I switched to Finish when it was still Electrasol because I could see a difference in the cleaning and non-filming action of it. At the time I lived on the West Coast where the water is naturally softer than in the Midwest, where I moved to three yrs ago. Finish Powerball might do the job by itself, but I also use Finish Jet-Dry, and I have "sparkly clear" glasses. I put everything into my dishwasher, including my Waterford vase, and they are cleaned perfectly: completely and clearly, no film whatsoever. LOVE IT!!
