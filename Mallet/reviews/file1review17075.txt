review/text: After my Braun shaver's beard trimmer function puked, I started looking for a replacement. Reading various reviews, it became apparent that a beard trimmer by itself was what I really needed. Based on other reviews here I purchased the Remington trimmer and have used it for several months. I couldn't be more pleased with it. This thing is super light weight, very easy to hold and just a delight after struggling with my shaver's mediocre trimming attachment. Wish I had known about this thing years ago. It actually came out of the box with a mostly charged battery and was ready to use, something I don't think I've ever encountered. The multiple settings make getting the right length easy and it seems to hold a charge for a really long time. I'm quite pleased, and think it is amazing for the price.
