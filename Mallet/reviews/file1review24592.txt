review/text: My husband took this as directed for "1" day and at 1:00 am that night he had a very bad Grand Mal Seizure.He had never had any type of seizure before and was rushed via ambulance to the hospital. I thought he was dying in front of my eyes, after the seizure, he was choking for air unconsiously on foam and blood that was in his mouth. Several minutes afterwards he could not talk and did not know what was going on. His speech was like that of a stroke victim. Finally he was able to speak but then did not know where he was or what day it was. The paramedics and fire dept were there by then. All of his blood tests, ekg, blood pressure and blood sugar tests perfomed while in the ER were perfectly normal, we were told it was the Zantrex - 3..Please protect your loved ones and do not take a chance with your life over this product. God bless.
