review/text: This massager is a very good product. My son is paralyzed, so I use this to relax his tight muscles, which really helps make him more comfortable. The infrared heat is a plus. It is large in size, but easy to handle, with 3 different settings. Just wish it had a slower speed than is provided on unit.
