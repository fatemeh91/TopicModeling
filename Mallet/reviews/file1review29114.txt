review/text: These are smaller and less dense than the usual stress balls. It does hold up very well and has yet to tear despite much use. The ergobeads provides much less back-pressure while you squeeze it. Overall it is different from normal stress balls but works quite well. You may also describe it as a mix between a hacky sack and stress ball.
