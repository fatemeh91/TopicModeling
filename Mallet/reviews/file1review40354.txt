review/text: The day after I got this package I was feeling kind of yuck. Then I went to a Jazzercise class out in the cold and came home chilled, aching, and cranky. I forgot about this until the next morning when I woke with a sore throat and a headache. Perfect time to try it out. I took two immediately and then set my kitchen timer for every 4 hours (it says 5 times a day). About late afternoon I felt noticeably better (the kids appreciated me less cranky), with no sore throat and no headache. I kept taking them through the next day until they were gone (figure 20 tablets will last two days if you follow the instructions). No further cold or flu symptoms ever happened, which I attribute to this because the next Jazzercise class had several people out sick. Given the cold and the germs in the gym that we were all exposed to, I think this made a difference.Echinacea too is something I give my youngest son (age 4) in the form ofL'il Critters Gummy Immune C Plus Zinc & Echinacea, Dietary Supplement for Kids, 60-Count Bottles (Pack of 4)and he seldom gets sick. However, he does get cranky. I've heard some doctors dismiss it's positive effects but at the same time, I've never read of any dangerous effects.In any case, the price isn't too bad when you figure the time saved from not being sick, not having a doctor visit, and just not feeling like crap.I wasn't familiar with this brand, but it has a Cabbage Patch doll kind of gimmick where you enter a code and trace your herbs life story (!!!!). Sheesh...who has time for that? But if you are into that, the info is there and accessible.I hope you find this information useful!
