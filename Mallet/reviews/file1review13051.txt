review/text: For years I've used a gel wrap made by Medi-Temp for my chronic neck pain which I love because it is ICY cold. I purchased the Elasto Gel because of the good reviews and because it looked like it would cover more of the neck and back area. I am extrememly disappointed in the Elasto Gel's temperature. Even after overnight in the freezer it feels more like a cool washrag out of the refrigerator rather than an Ice pack. If I'm not able to return it, mine will soon be available on Ebay.
