review/text: I was in a terrible fog. Couldn't complete the simplist of tasks. At 48, I was beginning to think that I was in the early stages of Alzeimers. I googled 'supplements for mental clarity' and Hyperzine A (one of Higher Minds ingredients) had some excellent study results.I noticed a difference within an hour of my first dose and was on top of my game by the end of my first bottle (which by the way was a 30 count) I resolved to keep this in my cabinet at all times. LOLI also am naturally about as ADD as a person gets. This product took that completely away! I cleared my work desk in a day, and believe me, it had been piled up for weeks.Initially, I took four a day. Two at a time with a meal. Now, I may go weeks without it, but if I start to feel less alert, I'm right back on it!!Higher Mind is LOADED with ingredients that are backed by research.And for the record, Amazon had the very best price around.
