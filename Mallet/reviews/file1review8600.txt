review/text: Pretty much every Good Grips product that I've bought over the years has been great, and this brush is no exception. The bristles are nice and strong, so that even with some serious pushing into the grout of our shower, they don't bend and stay in place. The hole on this is also a nice feature since it allows me to hang it in the shower for ease of use. Useful product!
