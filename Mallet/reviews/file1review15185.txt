review/text: This is the first Balance product I ever tried, years ago.I love it. I used to be able to purchase Honey Peanut at my local discount store, they stopped carrying this quite a while ago and I missed Honey Peanut substituting Caramel Nut Blast but it just wasn't the same...p.s. My local store started carrying the yogurt peanut bar (ick). BTW, Balance recently reformulated Caramel Nut Blast, very nasty.Anyway, I am delighted to be able to order Honey Peanut from Amazon.
