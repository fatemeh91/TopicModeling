review/text: I absolutely swear by Optimum Nutrition! This protein powder is amazing, and it's definitely helped my muscle building and recovery. I've tried a few of the flavors, all on other people's advice, and I didn't care for most of them. That being said, I recently decided I'd go against the warnings about strawberry flavored protein powders and try Delicious Strawberry. WOW! Anyone who said this flavor was gross is absolutely mad! The name says it all! It tastes like strawberry milk, but with a hint of strawberry candy flavor. It's honestly the best flavor I've tried and I'm completely in love with it. I've tried Cookies and Cream, and yuck, the cream flavor is WAY too strong and it tastes more like a really sweet cream and mocha flavor? I had to hold my nose while drinking it. I've also tried Extreme Milk Chocolate, which I also didn't care for but it was more tolerable in milk. Vanilla was good for it's mix-ability, but it tastes more like sugar cookies than vanilla. And it sort of makes everything you mix with it taste like sugar cookies, unless you mix it with something strong like orange juice (which actually does taste good). However, I was unable to drink any of these with just water without gagging. With Delicious Strawberry it's PERFECT in a nice cold glass of water! So refreshing and yummy! If you like strawberry milk and have a sweet tooth, DO NOT be put off by what other people say! Try it!
