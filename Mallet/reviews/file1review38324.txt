review/text: I have no complaints about the job this product does - it pulls the hair from the root quickly and easily. I would take this over shaving any day!Pros:-Quick, easy, and lasts longer than shaving. I love it because I can do it while sitting in front of the TV, rather than being trapped in the shower with a razor.-Your hair will begin to grow in thinner and sparser as time goes by. My mother has been using one of these for 10 years and she only has to do "touch ups" every few weeks.-Great for those of us with thick or dark hair. You don't get that "hair under the skin" look that shaving gives you.Cons:-The pain of the first two or three times is intense. Your eyes WILL water, your skin WILL turn red (and possibly bleed) and you WILL begin to think you're crazy for continuing. By about the fourth time though, you'll barely feel it at all and you'll be happy you kept at it.-Ingrown hairs. Since the hairs become weaker as you use this, they might start having a problem breaking the skin. Rubbing the area you'll be using it on with the included loofa in the shower before you do it works wonders though, and is highly recommended!-Yes, it lasts longer than shaving, but not by much. Unless you've hardly got any hair or it's very fine, you'll still find yourself doing this every few days if you want to stay smooth.-By far the BIGGEST MOST FRUSTRATING drawback is the fact that this product does not last long. I am ordering a new one today - my second one this year. After a while these things slow down and barely work. Sometimes they even just plain break. I am on my 4th one in only two years. Even with very careful use and cleaning every time you use it, you will probably find yourself replacing this once or twice within a year, and they aren't cheap.Overall, I really like this product and haven't ever considered discontinuing use. I would recommend this to anyone who is sick of shaving and wants to try something different!
