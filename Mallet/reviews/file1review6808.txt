review/text: My husband had a knot/spasm in his back that would NOT go away for weeks, even after physical therapy and muscle relaxers. Out of desperation, he found this product online and decided to give it a try. After several days of working the knot in 5-minute sessions and then resting, the spasm finally subsided and he's back to normal again. This is well worth the $25 or so it cost!
