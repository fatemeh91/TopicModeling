review/text: I generally ice my hip before sleep, and i find the elastogel cervical collar to be very useful for this purpose. Soft and flexible, it molds well to any inflamed or painful area. A friend suggested it to me, and hers has lasted many years! She also uses it hot at times, but i'm a fan of cold.
