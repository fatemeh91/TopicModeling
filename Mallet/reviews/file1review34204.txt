review/text: Okay, I find all the reviews of this product that comment on smell to be amusing. You are applying it to your anus. It is not the best smelling part of any body. Pretty much, almost anything you put on it, smells better than its natural state. This stuff smells like mentholated patchouli incense... much better than a hemmoroidal poop chute.That said, this product is fantastic! It is extremely cooling - even after the initial application. You'll feel nothing but a blissful cool tingle as the swollen 'roids shrink. Seriously, it is like applying rose-colored ice cream to your bum... and the cool LASTS. I liked to mix this stuff with Nupercainal to get a cooling and numbing effect. After a day and a night, I can actually think of something other than on the pain and discomfort radiating from my backside. Buy this product. It is inexpensive and will let you focus on things other than your sore rectum.
