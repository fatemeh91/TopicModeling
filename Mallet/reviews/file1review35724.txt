review/text: I have had dry eye symptoms for a couple years now. I used eye drops recommended by my eye Dr. After I started my new job, I realized my eyes were having an allergic type reaction at work! Irritated, dry, puffy, red and blurry...Yuk, misery actually. So I tried these and they are better than any other drops and I've tried dozens. Very good, very effective and natural. I think I had a sensitivity to the preservatives in some OTC drops. These are the best.
