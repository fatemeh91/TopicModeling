review/text: I've used this belt before for SI problems that put me down for about six weeks. The belt helps so much (paired with home exercise) and I ran the Napa Marathon after four weeks of being on the belt. The only problem: while the belt helps to support the SI and surrounding tendons, the IT (iliotibial band that runs down the sides of your legs) doesn't receive the support of your back because it's being cut off from the belt. After recovering from SI, I began suffering from IT in both legs which put me down another three weeks. Use the belt in moderation, focus more on home exercise and building your core - that will strengthen and support your SI without having to use the belt so much.
