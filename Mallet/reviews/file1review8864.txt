review/text: I have never taken any supplements before OTHER than my multi-vitamin. I just got mine in today so not enough time for a review yet so there will def be an update in a few weeks! I would like to take a BIG stick and smack all the whiny reviews/folks about complaining about the taste!!!REALLY? Sounds like a kid crying over eating veggies lol anyways, I guess some taste buds can't hack it. This does NOT taste like mud or dirt or like licking a pond! I can taste a hint of seaweed and it reminds me of broken down vitamins. ACTUALLY Biting into a multivitamin will taste much worse. The taste kind of reminds me of the smell of a farm hahaha IDK if that makes sense. It is very tolerable to me, I tasted it on it's own and I mixed it with OJ in a shot glass so I could down it alot faster and it is NOT bad at all! I have eaten foods from all around so I guess I broke my taste buds in. My son barely turned 4 and i gave him 1/4 of a tablespoon mixed in a shot glass with OJ and he drank the whole thing! Will update in a few weeks, it's only been 30 min since I drank it and I feel much better but IDK if my mind is playing tricks on me =P
