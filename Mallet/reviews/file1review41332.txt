review/text: I've purchased over 2 dozen of these little brooms for our neighborhood cleanup group in the past 3 years. Everyone loves them (especially if you're a vertically challenged person or you want your kid to have their own small broom,to encourage them to help YOU out with Spring cleanup.) Some neighbors have even left them out in the Winter next to their step to sweep up snow. While they don't hold up as well as if kept inside, they'll last a good 2 years even outdoors.But keep them inside and they'll last so much longer.I love 'em and so do our neighbors. These little brooms have kept our 6 street neighborhood looking spic and span.
