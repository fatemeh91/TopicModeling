review/text: I purchased mine at Nordstrom and have been very satisfied with it. It instantly soothes mild razor irritations. And only one to two pump is really needed to get the job done. And i love the glass bottle finish definitely feels elegant. If your looking for a unscented after shave balm alcohol free try this one out. You will be so satisfied that if you try any other product after this you will compare them to this, and it will definitely set standards.
