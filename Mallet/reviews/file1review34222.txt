review/text: I was at my wits end!! Absolutely going crazy with the pain of a hemorrhoid the size of a small grape. After 3 weeks of dealing with the discomfort I was desperate to try anything and everything I could find. Nothing I bought at my local grocery/drug store was working...I even tried home remedies that irritated and burned the sensitive tissue. So I was searching high and low all over the internet in desperation, I remembered I got my first hemorrhoid was when I gave birth and the only thing that helped were Tucks suppositories that I could no longer find here locally so I did a search and low and behold they popped up on Amazon...well I continued to search for an ointment to use while I was using the suppository and found this!!! Indeed it was my lucky day! Had it shipped overnight due to a vacation I was leaving on in the next few days...and this was my miracle worker! It took the pain away within minutes! It helped shrink the irritated tissue from a grape size to a very small pea within a weeks time....but I had absolutely NO pain from the first application...I kept using it for a total of 2 weeks and it has gone away completely! Yes it has a weird smell and stains your undergarments but I really don't care....I was more concerned with getting my life back up to par, the 3 weeks of pain, burning and discomfort had put a halt on my lifestyle...I couldn't walk, stand or sit for more than 30 minutes at a time due to the pain I was in!! This was my lifesaver!! I will be stocking up and spreading the word about this wonderful Chinese concoction!! Please Amazon, keep this one in stock to help the others suffering as I was! Hope this review helps people on the fence! Try it, You will not be sorry!
