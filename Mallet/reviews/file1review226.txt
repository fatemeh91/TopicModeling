review/text: Evercare extra sticky lint roller is the best product that I have tried of its kind. It is great for removing lint and pet hair from clothing, furniture, bedspreads, etc., and I believe no dog or cat owner, or owner of any furry animal, should be without this item.It is also wonderful for removing fiberglass from your skin and clothing if you have been ripping out or installing fiberglass insulation or working with resin and fiberglass. If you've ever worked around fiberglass you know how it sticks in your skin and itches like mad. Evercare extra sticky lint roller actually pulls the fiberglass right out of your skin.Another great use for this product is removing seed ticks. If you live in the southern United States, you know what an unpleasant experience it is to wander into seed tick territory. You can pick up hundreds of these miniscule little bloodsuckers and have them crawling all over your clothes, skin, car upholstery, etc. With Evercare extra sticky lint roller, you can remove them easily. It will even remove ones that are attached. Just roll them right off.
