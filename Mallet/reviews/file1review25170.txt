review/text: The refills are as if you repurchased the razor. They appear to last at least over a year, and I have quick growing thick facial hair. As well, rinsing them after each shave clears the foil for a closer shave next time.In addition these also fit the FreeControl 1000 series razors. They are identical. Inexpensive and long lasting, what more can I say.
