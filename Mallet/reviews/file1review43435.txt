review/text: I'm afraid that Flake as well as most of the Cadbury's products I grew up with are no longer the same product, whether purchased in the U.K./Ireland or elsewhere. Whenever I go back to the Isles I buy approx. 100 or so Euro's worth of my favourite Cadburys products and sadly to report none of them taste the same as they used to. They are now closer to the awful taste of Hershey's chocolate than anything else, more sweet and waxy than smooth and silky. There are only two Cadbury's products still worth purchasing as far as I'm concerned; the large bars of plain dairy milk, and the Twirl bar. Twirls are more or less Flakes that are covered or encased in chocolate so they are only Flaky on the inside. Smarties, Flakes, buttons all now taste like American chocolate.
