review/text: I LOVE all replenix formulas! The serums are thick and matte, and you get results! I would suggest this to anyone who is looking for a Retinol serum. Replenix serums have a low alcohol content, and minimal fillers so a little bit goes a long way. These serums have helped me treat acne and wrinkles, give it a try but start low (5X vs. 10X) because irritation can occur, I speak from experience.
