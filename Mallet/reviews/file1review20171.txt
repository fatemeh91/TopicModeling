review/text: I used to drink a lot of juice, but these days, it's all filled with high fructose corn syrup and other sugars, and it's just too sweet and unhealthy. These days I mainly drink water, but I enjoy putting a little of this concentrate either in carbonated water or just tap water for a little flavor. And a bottle will last you FOREVER. Great stuff!
