review/text: My father suffers from back pain and hip pain. I bought this item for him two years ago, not really knowing if it was liked or not... he's not a man of many words. Well, he just visited from FL and I could see he needed a replacement, as his was a well used and well worn favorite accessory. I just got another one for him, and he was thrilled. Told me that he uses it every day and makes sure it's always packed when travelling. By the looks of the first one, he was telling the truth. Works well, I am truly happy that my Dad found it to be so helpful. He does wear diabetic socks, (not sure if that would matter or not in it's usefulness).
