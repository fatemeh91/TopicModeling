review/text: These bars are the best of all the Glucerna bars. I have tried them all & like all of them. This one is like eating a fresh brownie & I enjoy eating it slow with coffee or skim milk. They replace my breakfast most days because I am slow getting ready for my drive to work & this is the most convenient & delicious way to start my day. I have told everyone I know how good they are. I didn't ask my doctor, but when I was tested, my blood sugars were normal, so it doesn't seem to be hurting me in any kind of way. I love chocolate & was very upset when I found out about being diabetic. I was looking for something sweet that would taste good and the glucerna products all taste good to me & I have lost weight since diagnosed & keeping off the pounds.Glucerna Meal Bar for People with Diabetes, Chocolate Chunk, Six- 4 Packs of 2.04 Ounce Bars
