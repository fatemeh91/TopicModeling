review/text: Although they're intentions are for curbing appetite, I have been buying and using them for a long time because it takes over a half an hourto consume and it satisfies my sweet tooth. They taste fabulous especially root beer, cinnamon, pink lemonade and candy cane. I panic whenI run low.
