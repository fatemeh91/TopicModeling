review/text: Comet Disinfectant Cleanser with Bleach is an excellent cleanser for your home. It does a marvelous job of cleaning many different types of surfaces including bathroom sinks, tubs, tile and fiberglass. You can even use Comet to clean the toilet bowl--I have done this many times with great satisfaction! They say, though, not to combine Comet with other toilet bowl cleansers; and I think this makes sense. Moreover, Comet disinfects as it cleans which is a huge plus. Comet gets rid of salmonella germs and some of the staph germs that can be so fearsome. Do NOT use this product with anything containing ammonia.Comet is easy to use. Just sprinkle some on a wet surface or sponge, wait a few seconds and then rub or rinse it off. Excellent! The instructions also say that you could use Comet on "delicate surfaces" including appliance enamel. However, I would consider using another cleanser to do THAT job. If you must us Comet for any surface that you feel is delicate, test Comet first in an inconspicuous place so it won't ruin the appearance of whatever it is you wish to clean. I personally don't use Comet for too many things outside my bathroom.Comet can be harsh on your eyes so don't use huge gobs of it when cleaning; I'm not too sure that it's safe to use Comet in large amounts when cleaning things. There's also a smell when you use large amounts of it that displeases me. Wash your hands after cleaning with Comet. If you have any other questions, the manufacturers of Comet give you a toll free number on the bottle; you can call them to ask questions about Comet. Good PR!Overall, Comet is a good product and you should not be scared away from it because of any cautionary notes I or the manufacturers may indicate. When used properly, Comet does a great job. It can irritate your eyes if you use too much at once; and it does have that odor that I find to be a little overwhelming as it cleans. Four stars for this product.
