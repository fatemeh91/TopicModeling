review/text: A bad night left me in a bad way. Sweating, crying, groaning, and otherwise wishing for a quick end. Prep. H only eased my heavy burden for as many minutes as dollars it took to purchase. That is when the Prophet known as Google led me on a journey to an ancient medicinal link to the past through the vast valley known as the Amazon. Here, I spoke to the tribes who have ventured down the same painful path as I.The Shaman's led me to this, Mayinglong Musk. An elegant mixture of herbs and other jungle delights, brought together to help cool, and otherwise ease the pain at which my soul was suffering within three days time.The mountainous region which was previously a sacred plain was once again returned to it's natural, picturesque scene of glory.
