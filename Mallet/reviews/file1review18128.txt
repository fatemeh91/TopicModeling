review/text: I've been using this eye mask for 9 months and have slept better than I ever had in the past. My eyes are very sensitive to light and any amount of light makes it impossible for me to sleep deeply. After much research, I decided on the Bucky 40 Blinks for price and design. The concave eye cup design makes this eye mask more comfortable than the traditional eye mask. Apparently, when traditional eye masks touch your eyelids, it can interfere with REM sleep cycle. I believe this to be true because of my quality of sleep. I do not find the velcro strap interfering with comfort or sleep. My fiance and I have not had any problems with light leakage around the nose area. We do have to adjust it a bit to create a tighter light seal. My problem with the Bucky is that the inner fabric separates after awhile. This defeats the purpose of the concave design. I bought 2 eye masks--a green and a black. The green has held up well. Not sure if the fabric is different but I did store it differently. Keeping it in the original plastic case prevented bending of the eye mask, which I think is the reason that the inner fabric separates. We weren't as careful with the black one. Nonetheless, it is much cheaper than other concave design eye masks. I love it so much that I bought 5 more as gifts. They all rave about it.
