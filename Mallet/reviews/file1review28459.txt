review/text: Bought this through Amazon some couple of weeks back. It's a big tub--bigger than I thought it would be. There's a scooper cup inside the tub but it's buried underneath all the whey. You'll have to use a spoon to dig it out.Since I have never tried any other brand of whey protein, I can't speak for the quality relative to those other brands but I can say that when I first bought it, I thought it was going to taste like crap. Reading various horror stories of whey protein powders that ranged from tasteless and bland to downright nasty from various health forums scared me a bit but some people claimed that this brand wasn't bad relative to others. So I took a dive in and hoped for the best. I was pleasantly surprised. It wasn't that bad. In fact, it's pretty good for what it is.I bought the double rich chocolate because I like chocolate and well, this powder comes pretty damn close to eating a Hershey's chocolate bar except in a liquid form.I do suggest buying a shaker cup as this doesn't mix very well with just a spoon. It'll clump up using a spoon. It's not a bad thing, if you don't mind melted clumps of whey protein. Frankly, I don't care one way or the other but if you're trying to down this in under 10 seconds, you're going to have a bit of difficulty. It's still drinkable, don't get me wrong, and the taste is still the same but if you prefer to chug it like water, shaking it in a shaker cup will make it a lot easier to drink if you're in a hurry.It does contain sucralose and cocoa powder, so if you're concerned about that, I'd suggesting looking elsewhere but personally, I'm not terribly concerned about that and I don't think you should be too concerned about that either unless you're just one of those health nuts.All in all, I recommend this brand for its taste to price and value. I think it's worth it.
