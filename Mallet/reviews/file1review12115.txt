review/text: This is my first pregnancy and when I first shopped for prenatal vitamin, I did not know what I was looking for.This product caught my eyes because it said " Gentle on Stomach" on the bottle.I tried a different brand after I finished the bottle and the new brand was flipping me upside down, causing me terrible morning sickness and heart burn.The pill is quite big but I invested a pill splitter ($5). It so much easier to take the pill and I'll be using it for at least 1 yr.
