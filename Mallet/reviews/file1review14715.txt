review/text: I was strictly pumping for my little one, so it was important to keep my supply up. I used fenugreek and mother's milk tea. I'm not sure it really worked. I thought maybe it was increasing my supply, but I think it might have been in my head. I do know that it made me smell like maple syrup big time. I also have suspicion that it was making my baby fussy, which I have read can be a side effect in other reviews. I think it might have upset his stomach because when we switched him to formula, he was much better, and that shouldn't be the case with breast milk. I know it wasn't what I was eating because I was quite careful to eat mild foods. So, I don't think I would recommend this product.
