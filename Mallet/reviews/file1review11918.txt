review/text: These pills are HUGE and incredibly dry!!! Are you kidding me? I'm supposed to swallow these while I'm nauseous?!? Fat chance! Although I have to admit, when I cut the pill into 3 pieces and choked each piece down with a ton of OJ, I didn't experience any weird side effects. So if you don't have a problem swallowing really big, chalky pills, the vitamins and minerals in these pills seem to balance nicely with your digestive system.
