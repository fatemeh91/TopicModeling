review/text: After having cataracts removed from both eyes, the doctor prescribed this for use at night to help keep my eyes from feeling like they had grains of sand under the lids. Since the operation, my eyes don't lubricate like they did previously, so I must use drops several times a day and this product at night. I would not think of going a night without putting a little in each eye, and when on occasion during the day my eyes feel scratchy in spite of the drops, I use this product also. It is very effective.
