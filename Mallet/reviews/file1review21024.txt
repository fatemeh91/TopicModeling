review/text: I often suffer from pretty bad all-year-round allergies. I have had no luck with OTC meds, and I refuse to take prescription drugs unless I absolutely have to. I've been taking Twinlab Allergy Fighters consistently for about 2 years and can honestly say it's the best allergy fighting stuff I've taken....and even though I still get some sniffles and a sneeze here and there in the springtime, this formula has abolished at least 90% of all symptoms. Definitely worth a try!!
