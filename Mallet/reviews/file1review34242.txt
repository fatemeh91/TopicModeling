review/text: I have been dealing with chronic hemmorroids for years. Based on the H Miracle ebook and the positive reviews...thought why not, right?!! WRONG!!! Big mistake. It did just the opposite. My prolapse hemm flared up even more... looked like a huge pink donut! Not the mention the terrible burning sensation and the medicine taste in my mouth. Not sure what that was about. It truly frightened me so I looked at the ingredients. The first thing I read was "synthetic". If this what people want to shove up their A.. then go right ahead. Not for me... I'll go back to my natural remedies.
