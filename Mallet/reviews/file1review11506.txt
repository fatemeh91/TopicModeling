review/text: These batteries are not very good at all. Even when used with a good charger, they simply don't have a very long life. I use them in a Canon digital camera, and after one or two shots, they start taking longer and longer to recharge the flash. Now, I take them right off the charger, the camera flashes the "low battery" sign, and they take 10-15 seconds just to charge the flash. The batteries that came with the charger (a La Crosse) last longer per charge and haven't worn out like these have. I'll never buy Duracell rechargeables again.
