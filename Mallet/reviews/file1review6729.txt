review/text: I'm sitting here reading the bad reviews with this fantastic tool on my neck as I am writing this, and had to make a comment ... I have constant neck pain from a past football injury. I have tried everything from doctors, medication, and saunas ... this is the ONLY thing tnat has ever helped me! ... I am sorry I did not invent it because it is really something that works ... if you have pain in your back or neck ... get this ... and don't listen to the idiot's who say it doesn't work, clearly their pain is not really bad ... because it has helped me more than anything else ... best part ... drug free!
