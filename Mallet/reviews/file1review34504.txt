review/text: I am 39 years old but very petite, I wanted to find an electric toothbrush to do a better job at cleaning my teeth (I was using a manual toothbrush before). All of the other toothbrushes that I looked at had a very large head or were super expensive. This toothbrush is very inexpensive and has the perfect size head. I could tell the difference in my tooth and gum cleanliness within two days of using this product.On the downside, it doesn't last very long - I have gone through 6 of these in a two year period already. Battery area conductor falls apart, etc. But, at this price, I have no problems just buying a new one. They do sell this product at Target, but they don't sell the refills there! I have no idea why - I ordered the refills here on Amazon.
