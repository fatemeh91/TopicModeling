review/text: Excellent product - I just wish I could buy it locally! My wife and I have had one for years and the kids have used ours. Now the kids finally have one of their own. Using this regularly reversed the gingivitis gum disease we were experiencing. Now our mouths are healthy. Plus, this is really the only &#34;realistic&#34; way for our kids to floss around their braces on a daily basis!
