review/text: Been taking this for 3 years now and its the best protein supplement out of my experience. You don't need me lecturing about the benefits of protein sups so I'll only speak of why I prefer this over others. Double chocolate tastes great without being too sweet or filling. Mixes super easy in a cup with a spoon or a bottle, almost little to no lumps every time. Great price for the amounts of protein each serving contains. Available in big 10 pound bag, not all brands carries 10lbs. Definitely recommends this to all protein supplement users, beginners or experts, you will taste and feel the difference.
