review/text: For those who complain about these socks falling apart, SUGGESTION: Make sure you do regular maintenance on your feet. That includes clipping toenails and buffing smooth all those areas of rough skin, like calluses, corns and bunions. Keeping sharp and rough skin away from the hose will ensure they last a long time. Also, hand wash in warm water with a small amount of mild detergent and then hand rinse in same temp water. Squeeze out excess moisture (wrap in a hand towel and twist the towel) and allow to air dry or hang over the sides of your TV to dry.I've had four pairs of these for about 6 months and wear them every day. Yes, I have to wash them every week but it's worth it.
