review/text: The good...they're inexpensive and washable. They even come with their own bag to wash them in.The bad...These pads bunch up some when washed, are conspicuous when worn, move around in the bra and leak when worn overnight (I'm not sure if the milk is running past them or going through them). Also, if you put the pad back in your bra immediately after nursing without drying the nipple off or applying lanolin or something similar, the pad glues itself to the nipple which is very uncomfortable to peel off (you'll need to wet the pad to get it off comfortably).
