review/text: This large cuff was perfect for my husband as he works out and has large bicep muscle area at 19" around relaxed.The Dr said to my husband check BP daily. (Husband has high normal BP at 130/85 and had high cholesterol / triglycerides, now normal) I didn't think his BP was that bad for someone over 45+ and smokes.I bought the Omron HEM-705CP Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor with Measurement Printout but the cuff was too small for his arm.So I ordered this larger cuff for him and it works perfectly, with true readings.This cuff is made for persons who have a larger bicep muscle area 17" to 21".The monitor comes with a smaller cuff more for persons with a max forearm area of 15" around max.
