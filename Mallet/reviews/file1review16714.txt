review/text: I'm not a smoker, so I bought the Zippo lighter for outdoor camping-type situations. The good news: it seems sturdy and the striker always creates a spark. The bad news: to make it work you have to fill it manually with lighter fluid. Then, within a couple of weeks, regardless of how you store it, the fluid evaporates, leaving you with a useless lump of metal. This is not really what I want to discover when I'm out in the field trying to light a fire... So if you are a smoker and will only use this at home and are prepared to re-fill the device every week, it will work fine for you. But if you need a reliable source of flame in more general circumstances, this is totally worthless and you should go for storm-proof matches and/or a cheap disposable plastic lighter because those somehow manage to retain their fluid reliably for years, instead of letting it evaporate over night.
