review/text: I have had this product for quite awhile and have only replaced batteries once. It seems to work well and gives me some peace of mind. Our grandchildren stay with us a couple times a month and it gives me a place to store their toothbrushes and feel they are safe to use. Previously, I bought new toothbrushes for them almost every time they stayed over.
