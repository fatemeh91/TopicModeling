review/text: I was skeptical these gloves could do what was claimed but I decided to buy them anyway and was really glad I did. My thumbs joints can get really painful, pretty much every day, and I put these gloves on and, amazingly, they begin relieving that pain almost immediately. After 10 minutes or so, I'm not even thinking about the pain. I wish I could wear them all the time but, as with any regular gloves, they don't allow you to do everything your fingers can do.I can wear them when I use my computer and that works OK. Couple of downsides: they tend to fray on edges after a couple of weeks' use and, they are difficult to get off. Taking them off requires pulling on end of finger holes for a few minutes until you can pull them off, or, gloves can be rolled off and glove fingers can be pulled inside out to get them back to normal.If you use these gloves regularly, you may need to buy another pair in a few months. I don't mind small amount of time to take them off.These gloves work really well.Amazon Verified Purchase
