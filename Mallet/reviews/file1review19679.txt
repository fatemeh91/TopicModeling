review/text: I am a first time Mom so I haven't tried out other toilet training products. With that being said, I am very pleased with this purchase. The rubber strip that surrounds the entire seat keeps it securely in place. My daughter easily places and removes the seat using the attached handle. Also, she seems very comfortable when she is sitting on it...she took to it right away. The adjustment on the bottom of the seat has proven useful. We have different shaped toilet seats in our bathrooms and this training seat can be adjusted to fit no matter which bathroom she is using it in. Very well thought-out design.
