review/text: I was provided with these Surgilast elastic stretch net dressings to cover a PICC (long duration IV port) site on my forearm. They come as a continuous tube that can be cut to the desired length and then placed over desired location. The dressing applies a gentle pressure to the covering and held the extra 2" of protruding tubing flat against my arm, providing extra comfort and protection. These are also reusable for two or three days, depending on how often you change the dressing.Highly recommended
