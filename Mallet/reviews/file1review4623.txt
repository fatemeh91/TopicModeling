review/text: My first razor was a single blade Schick Injector razor (mid-1960s). Then I had a couple of electric razors. About three years ago my wife informed me I needed to go back to a blade. Even though properly maintained, the electrics were not doing the job.Single blade razors were not available anyplace I looked. I bought a two blade razor. It seemed to work OK. One day a Gillette Fusion appeared in our mailbox as a sample and I have been using it since. It does a better job that a two blade razor. I even had opportunity to shave for a week with the two blade system again. It can do a good job, but it takes more effort to get a good shave. The Fusion generally does a good job, but also needs good technique to get the best shave. This includes shaving against the whisker grain at all times, lathering up and waiting a minute or so for the beard to soften, and making my skin tight so the whiskers cannot roll under the approaching blade uncut.The blades are not cheap. I get more life from them by cleaning the shaving foam out of them with water, shaking the razor to expel excess water, and then rinsing the blades with rubbing alcohol to absorb the remaining water and prevent microscopic surface rust, which is a leading cause of blades dulling. I get about three times my normal blade life this way.
