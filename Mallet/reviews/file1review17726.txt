review/text: I have no complaints at all about the trim and functionality of this unit. I use it for a medium to close goat and mustache trim and have been very satisfied.Sad to say, after 2 years the battery will not hold a charge for more than a day or so and I presume that will only get worse. Unfortunately you cannot use it as a corded, you have to wait for it to charge. Luckily I don't need to trim everyday so I just plug it in ahead of time.That's a shame. I would gladly buy again if it had a better or replaceable battery.
