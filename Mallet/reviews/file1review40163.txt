review/text: This mat does stick well to the floor but also sticks well to your body, especially when you are sweaty which you will be during yoga. So that is very very annoying. Also at certain location where there is deep impact/contact with the foot especially, during the downward/upward dog positions, the mat tends to crack and the material starts peeling off creating potholes in the mat! For its price its ok but not the best product.The blocks are good. I have not yet felt the need for the strap so cannot comment on that.
