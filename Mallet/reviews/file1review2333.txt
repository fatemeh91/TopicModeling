review/text: At times, my vision would get a little blurry. If I blinked a few times, or rubbed my eyes, it helped, but the blur would come back. If I was driving, it was particularly troubling. This seems to have (??) aided the lubricant in my eyes. Not too sure about what caused the problem, or the way this product worked -- but it did.
