review/text: The backdrop (skip to 2nd paragraph if you just want the product review).. I'm a health conscious, young male from NY and I've been looking for the best vitamins and supplements I could find to get into a long-term routine and stick with it. I got introduced to supplements through Garden of Life products, which are great and have excellent sources. I recommend them if you are looking for super-food supplements. Although now I personally take 'Source Naturals Men's Life Force Multiple'. Anyway, after reading the reviews and getting interested I decided to try these as an immune system supplement and I'm completely impressed.After the change of this season, 3 people in my house became sick with a cold. I did not and I credit it to this product primarily because I was taking the recommended dosage for staying healthy and a few weeks into their illness I started to get a mucus build-up (like you experience right before you get sick) and decided to ramp up the dosage to the recommended amount. After doing this, and drinking mixtures with apple cider vinegar, I got over it almost immediately. Absolutely no nonsense, gone. However, in order for any supplement to work, you have to eat properly in the first place. Taking in a lot of sugar, drinking, depressing the immune system with junk it can barely make use of all reduce the effectiveness of anything you take. So keep that in mind & I hope this review helps in some way.
