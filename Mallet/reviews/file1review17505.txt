review/text: I have the same experience as mentioned by Amazon user "Jwilkins"Worked great for 5 or 6 weeks, used probably 10-15 times. Then it stopped charging completely. Possibly an issue with the batteries, but even so, should last longer than this.Bought overseas, not really worth the effort of getting it fixed as it was only $20...I won't be taking the risk and buying another, even at 1/4 the price of the other ones I am looking at.Now I'm off to the store to buy another with a half shaved beard.
