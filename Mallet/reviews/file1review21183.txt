review/text: I bought this on a recommendation by a friend and have been happy with it. I give it a 4 star only because I've had it for a month. It gets a 5th star if it still works after 15 years. Something that is not explained by anyone is the term "Moist Heating." You don't put water on this thing so there is no moisture other than what is in your own skin. I don't get it but it is reliable for the month and is quite warm which my wifie likes. The activation switch requires enough force to keep it on when you want without hand stress and enough to turn off when you fall asleep with it on. Good design.
