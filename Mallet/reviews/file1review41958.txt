review/text: This is by far the best protein out there period!!! Pro Complex is good as well but cost a bit more. I've tried several brands such as BSN's syntha 6 ON's 100%whey CYTO sport Muscle Milk and some other ones that I rather not mention. For me this is the best out there just one scoop after working-out with a low carb diet and you'll start seeing results before you finish the container (realistic gains 2-3 pounds of muscle). oh by the way the first guy must be on super special diet or is not used to be taking whey protein, I don't get it!!! anyways ELITE COMPLEX IS TOP OF THE LINE.
