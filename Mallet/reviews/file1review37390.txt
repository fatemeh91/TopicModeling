review/text: It works, its fast and its easy.I'm sure you have read the reviews as I did. Be aware that it'll be painful at first, just like when you first plucked your eyebrows and then it gets less painful.When I first tried it I was always shouting Aw! Aw! Aw!. Of course, I havent waxed my legs for quite sometime so using this epilator would proved to be a grit-teeth-grinding experience. Then you get used to it. hahahaha.I wonder if I can use this like a brazilian wax alternative. I'll try it tonight. Ive been using this for months nbow so I highly recommend it.Start MOWING your legs and good luck.
