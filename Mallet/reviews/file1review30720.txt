review/text: Okay. I have been shaving my face and head with cartridge razors for the past 4 or 5 years every day, and I finally got sick of paying 25 bucks for 4 new razor heads. I suppose like most people that have decided to take this route instead. I first wanted to try a cut-throat razor, but after reading about it a bit I learned i had to learn how to sharpen it, buy a strop for 100 bucks, and the razor itself was over 100. I decided to try out a DE, for much less money, and the merkur series caught my eye.i read a few "how to and why" articles online about DE shaving before i attempted to shave. i havent cut myself with a cartridge razor since i first started shaving, but i was still a little worried after reading reviews and warnings.i had about 4 days of beard growth, i took a shower before shaving, washed my face a few times, kept my face wet, lathered up with dial bar soap [using my hands], and had a nick free shave. afterwards i applied some nivea after shave. it seems to be much smoother and more effective than a quatro or mach 3. i dont think ill buy another cartridge razor again.so anyway, extremely high quality product. great shave. maybe read the "how to and why" article at classicshaving.com, and as long as you take a couple extra minutes to shave, you shouldnt have a problem.
