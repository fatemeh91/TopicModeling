review/text: Can't believe I didn't check Amazon's price first. I paid nearly twice this price locally to get these, and I now have 3 pairs: 1 for the bathroom, 1 for my purse (chin hair emergencies can happen anytime, anywhere) and a spare pair in case the tips get bent (Tweezerman will sharpen and straighten tips for a very small fee).Bottom line: I've used these for several years and they are the absolute best for ingrown chin hairs (menopausal women know very well what I'm talking about) and essential for splinters. And 9 bucks is a great price for something so indispensable. I plan never to be without a pair within easy reach for the rest of my days, and I really don't say that about much.
