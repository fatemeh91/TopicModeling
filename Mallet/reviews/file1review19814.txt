review/text: Ran into a little problem with our first over-potty seat -- our toddler (turns 3 this summer) had outgrown the splatter shield, and with little boys, this was a problem. I needed a new seat that worked for him, provided stability, and didn't require a separate potty (since emptying and cleaning the separate potty got to be a pain with his older brother). Ordered this, and have been very pleased with the result. Our son (who is in the final stages of potty training and wants to be very independent) is able to put it on and take it off the potty all by himself, it fits snugly and securely, and it is extremely adjustable. Seat has the standard opening for taking care of business, but also 1-2 inches of additional "supported depression" around that for settling in little bottoms. We're very pleased, but more importantly, so is he!
