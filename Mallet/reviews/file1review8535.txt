review/text: It is surprisingly hard to find a brush like this. I just wanted it to be able to clean my travel mugs really well. I don't like putting them in the dishwasher and a sponge does not reach everywhere. This is a great brush for a good price. I have been using it for about a year and it still looks great, the bristles do not wear easily so I think it will last for a long time. I am now able to reach all those touch spots in my travel mugs, carafes, and vases.
