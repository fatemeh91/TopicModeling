review/text: I tend toward high-intensity workouts (bjj, muay thai, olympics, sprint work, & heavy plyo). I have a series of knots on my neck that pop up after really good workouts or if I get into an awkward position. It's probably a pinched nerve. Small knots on the right side of my upper back, bigger ones through my right trap towards my shoulder blade, then serious knots that work its way up my neck towards the base of my skull.The trigger wheel is the first device that I've used that has helped this spot. The wheel isn't magic. The knots don't disappear immediately, but there is a noticeable decrease in pain and recovery time. The 'pinch' goes away almost immediately after using it...I get that nice warm feeling on the pain points that tells me the blood is flowing and that I have range of motion back.If you have muscle pain in awkward spots that you can't get to with the stick or foam roller this is a nice little addition to your recovery arsenal. For the amount of relief, I think twenty-five bucks is plenty fair.
