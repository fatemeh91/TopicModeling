review/text: I am very impressed at how well this was packaged and how quickly it was shipped. Great company! The taste was bitter but expected that since it is unsweetened. It has a bit of a woodsy smell and flavor to it that I did not expect. We've tried many different Elderberry products but never pure concentrate. We dilute a little bit each morning and add a sweetener. Each child gets a 1/2 teaspoon and doesn't mind it as long as I remember to add honey or Truvia. They prefer the taste of the name brand tablets but they don't dislike this concentrate. I love that it's pure and natural with no alcohol. I wonder how much it can be diluted and still retain its healthy benefits?
