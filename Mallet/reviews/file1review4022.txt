review/text: I have owned every incarnation of the Gillette razor, and I can easily say that this is the best. Look, the Mach 3 is a superior razor, and if you are happy with it, don't worry about immediately running to the store for a Fusion. However, the next time you are about to invest in blades, I definitely recommend you consider making the switch. You will be happy. If you do not own any of Gillet's miraculous contributions to mankind, good lord, it's like you have been watching a black and white TV.To address some of the issues brought up in the other reviews:1. The single razor on the back is necessary to shave some hard to reach places, and although it is an effect of the enormous shaving face, it is well worth it.2. King of Shaves shaving oil is amazing no matter what razor you use.
