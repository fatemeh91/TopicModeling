review/text: This is your standard bottle brush, good for cleaning bottles and baby food jars. It does a good job on the sides, but an imperfect job on the bottom (this is typical of bottle brushes, due to the shape of the brush). I drop a paper towel in the bottom and use the brush to push it around.
