review/text: While this is a big change compared to dual blade razors, they seem to dull fairly quickly, and the moisturizing strip doesn't seem to last more than 3-4 days for me. I've tried drying it off after using it, but it doesn't extend the life that long (and it seems like a big expense based up on the sort life).I'm switching to the Shick Hydro, as I got a free sample, and the blade there has lasted two, going on three weeks. I may have to try the shower cleaner trick to see how long I can make the Hydro's last.
