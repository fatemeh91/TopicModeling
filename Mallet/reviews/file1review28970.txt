review/text: I have an aincent Norelco with spinning blade heads that does a much better job than this thing did out of the box, even though my old shaver has blades which have been in it for a few years. I needed a new razor since the battery is almost toast on that old thing. The Cruzer3 has a lot of power, but it just wants to vibrate its way across the room. It takes a long time to get a good shave with this, and my hand was numb by the time I was done. The screen is no good at picking up longer hairs -- admittedly more comfortable than the snagging that my old razor sometimes does, but the vibration far outweighed that benefit.
