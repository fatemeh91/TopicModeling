review/text: I am 33 weeks pregnant and this has really helped me get through the day. I invested in a pair of good supportive shoes and even wear compression hose. But I was still feeling beat by mid day. I got this to help support my belly because my baby is low and all in front, lol. So far, I have worn this three days in a row. I don't feel so drained any more and it has helped with my back as well. I'm glad I got it.
