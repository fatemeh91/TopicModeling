review/text: The very first time I used this foot spa, I was really pleased. I was looking for one that would provide adequate heat and one that would retain the heat for as long as needed. This spa, unlike the previous one I had, did as advertised. I found the heat just as I wanted. In fact, I had to turn the heat off, temporarily, as it became too warm but I would rather have to turn the heat off than not to have it heat up well enough or retain the heat. So far, I am very happy with it and would recommend it to anyone looking for a quality foot spa that isn't too expensive.
