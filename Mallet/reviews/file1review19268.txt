review/text: My husband started taking Fertility Blend for Men in July after his initial dx was poor morphology (3% normal). The doctors told us that we would most likely not conceive without IVF. At his follow-up in November, his morphology improved to 6% which took him out of the subfertile range. The doctors are pleased with the results and have confidence that we can now conceive without IVF. I believe the vitamins improved his numbers. I think his numbers will continue to improve the longer he takes the supplements. I would definitely recommend this product.One thing to mention, for any of you who are not good at reading directions like my husband. The serving size is 2 capsules. My husband was only taking 1 a day the first couple weeks - oops!
