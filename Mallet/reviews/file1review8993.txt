review/text: I have been using Emerald Balance which has Stevia added as a sweetener. It was great if you were making a smoothie but much too sweet if mixed with juices. I like this Green Vibrance because I can sweeten it if I want. It doesn't end up too sweet when mixed in a smoothie with a sweet fruit like a banana.I am not sure why the directions says "Best taken 30-45 minutes after eating." This is a product that seems to be taken in the a.m. mixed with juice or in a smoothie. Actually it would to be good to drink BEFORE eating as an appetite suppressant. Could it upset your stomach? Otherwise, this has ALL the green stuff, and then some you could ever want.
