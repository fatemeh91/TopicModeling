review/text: For me, this Blue Sage fragrance is the best smelling among all of Caldrea's cleaning product lines. I was already familiar with the dish washing liquid (as someone got me hooked with a free sample) and I love the way it smells up my kitchen after washing a few dishes. So I decided to try the Stainless Steal cleaner because my stainless appliances easily get fingerprints all over them and I can't get them completely off with just water or regular cleaners. This stuff not only removed them immediately, but it seemed to make the stainless steal resistant to them for quite a while afterward. Since I got the ss cleaner I have only had to use it once.I highly recommend this stuff if you have the same problem; I don't think you'll be disappointed. It's worth it for the fresh smell alone but it also happens to do it's job very well too.
