review/text: Be careful... what you get may be different than the photo! I thought I had ordered the Ace TekZone wrist wrap with gel padding, but received the "basic" wrist brace without gel (the photo shows the blue-green gel). Not a big deal, but the items are apparently sized differently. My original TekZone was a medium and fit well whereas the "basic" was a SM/Med and was MUCH too small (and I have a small wrist). This bad sizing was not my mistake, but the vendor (not Amazon) will not refund the shipping!
