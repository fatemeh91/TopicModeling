review/text: We're a manufacturing setting - a bronze foundry of sorts. We work with bronze and pewter - patina, welding, molding, lost-wax processes, etc. These gloves are EXCELLENT for our field/processes. We've been searching for powder-free gloves that work well, and are durable - and these are wonderful. Great lasting durability. And a great price. You can't beat that.
