review/text: The Elasto-gel Cervical Collar doesn't fit very well. The Velcro closure in the front is in an odd place and therefore the collar sits in an uncomfortable position when I have it on. There is a space in the back between the back of my neck and the collar so I have to put my hand on the back of the collar and hold it to my neck. It's better when lying down, but I got the collar to be able to be up and around, getting things done, while getting some pain relief.
