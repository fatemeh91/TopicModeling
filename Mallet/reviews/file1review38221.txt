review/text: It is the first natural product that really works for constipation and digestion. My boyfriend has to be on strong pain medication which causes constipation as a side effect. Not a pleasant benefit to reducing severe pain. Psyllium husk powder mixes well with our protein shakes and we sprinkle it on our cereal in the morning. No nasty taste to worry about and it mixes well with all we have used it with including making our pancakes and muffins healthier. We will continue to use it.
