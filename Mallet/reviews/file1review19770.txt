review/text: My daughter was 4.5 yrs and still refused to go on the potty! Initially we tried the cushiony seat that just moved all over the place. I finally figured out that she had this huge fear of falling in the toilet. I let her know I was buying a seat that would never let her fall in. We anxiously awaited it's arrival. Two days after receiving this Baby Bjorn seat, she was fully potty trained and we threw away all the diapers.
