review/text: Instead of sending dead flowers, give your ex a can of this stuff. J & J is doing Canadian consumers a favor by withholding this product from the market. Hoping I was getting a worthy successor to the Johnson's Beautiflor my mother used, I ordered a bottle of this stuff from the States. It is easy to apply and dries to a brilliant shine. But here's the rub (ha ha). As soon as I shifted some furniture on it, it scuffed. Unlike paste wax or Beautiflor you can't buff it back up. The dog leaves scratch marks all over it. I am waiting for spring in order to remove the mess with mineral spirits (the solvent).
