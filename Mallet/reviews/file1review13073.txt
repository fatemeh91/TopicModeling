review/text: I bought this to provide some relief for my headaches and migraines It stays cold for about 20 minutes and cool for a while (just as they say). It is soft, flexible, and pretty thick. I'm very glad I bought this.In case you have doubts this CAN go in the freezer and it does stay flexible and comfortable. I have not used it hot yetMy only warning/negative is if you have issues with constriction around your neck you might want to reconsider. It isn't overly tight as it is adjustable but the still could be a bit snug on someone with a larger neck, the issue mainly comes with how wide the collar around the front of the neck. My mother was unable to use for this reason but for me the relief far out weighed the mild discomfort.
