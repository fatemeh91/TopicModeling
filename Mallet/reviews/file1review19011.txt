review/text: As a fibromyalgia patient I have ongoing problems with constipation. I had been using, quite successfuly for several years, a natural fiber product from dr. natura. However, at times the fiber product was just gaggy. It made a claim and lived up to it especially when using the tea that it was designed to work with. I had seen commercials for Benefiber and thought I would give it a try--bye bye $20.I used it for a week as directed on the container. I was increasing constipated as the week wore on and ultimately had to resort to UNnatural means to relieve myself.Last night I tried a test...2 measured teaspoons in 8oz warm water in a clear glass. I mean, shoot, if it really IS fiber, there should be some sort of thickening, or evidence of fiber, like there should be in my gut to create movement, right? Nada. It is as clear this morning as when I filled the glass with plain water.Then I read the actual ingredient 'wheat dextrin' and googled it. Dextrins, of all sorts, are what are used to make glue. Yah. Glue. Yes, Benefiber is clear and quite drinkable, but for me quite worthless as a fiber supplement. Doesn't matter how easy it is to drink, if it doesn't work!I am now back to using the 'yes, it is sludgy but WORKS' natura colon cleansing product and am satisfied. However, I now have $19 worth of glue component left on my counter. Google did say the food industry uses dextrins to make baked goods crisp. Maybe I could bake with it?
