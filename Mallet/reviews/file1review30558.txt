review/text: In two words: it works. Years ago, I had always used only a deodorant and not an anti-perspirant. Then one time I accidentally got the anti-persperant instead. I thought I might as well try it. BAD IDEA for me! Some people just don't tolerate the chemicals in these products, I think it was the aluminum. I had a SEVERE reaction that eventually required a visit to a dermitologist who gave me an injection of steroids and a presciption for prednisone. Eventually I got over it, but I have been extremely careful since then about what goes under my arms. Back to deoderants for me, but they never really seemed to work that well and sometimes my spouse would kindly remind me of that. Then about 8 months ago I ran across this product at a Walmart store in CA. It really works, and I have not had any reaction at all to it. I couldn't find it in our local store, so I got it online. Great product for me.
