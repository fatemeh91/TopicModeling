review/text: I tried this product the other day while at a bar. I tried to remove a stain that resulted from me spilling a little Kung Pao on my shirt that I had a Thai/Chinese restaurant. The stain remover was given to me from a lady that I had met at the bar, and as I tried to use it, I noticed that the tube was really hard and nothing came out as I squeezed it. I tried to loosen the stuff inside the tube with a toothpick, but very little came out. The stuff that did come out wasn't effective at removing my stain (maybe because not enough of the stain remover was applied), but it did manage to remove some of the color in my shirt (that might have been due to the bleach-smelling substance that was in the spot remover). Eventually, I used a spot remover that I had at home and the stain was washed out. Based on my experience with the Tide Instant Stain Remover, I will not buy this product and will not recommend it to my friends. It doesn't even deserve a "1 Star."
