review/text: I've not tried other protein shakes recently, so this review is pointed specifically at the Champion Nutrition Pure Whey Protein Stack.I chose the chocolate flavor as the vanilla flavors tend to make me gag and are overly sweet.I mix the protein powder with a bit of hot water to help dissolve better and then add nonfat milk to top it off. It comes out smooth with very few lumps and if you allow it to sit for a minute, it actually gets a bit creamy. Tastes good and goes down smooth. I actually look forward to a shake after workouts now.In the month that I've been using it combined with my workout, I've noticed an increase in size in the shoulders and arms. How much of this can be attributed to the shake, I can't say, but it sure takes the edge off my hunger after a workout. After drinking this I'm satisfied but not stuffed and it helps me to not snack on junk which defeats the purpose of my working out.I still have more than half a jar left which is a great value considering the cost. I plan to continue buy this product after I run out.
