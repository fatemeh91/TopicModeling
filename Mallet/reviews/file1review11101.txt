review/text: I started taking Emergen C close to a year ago. It was the Christmas holidays and I was sick with a terrible cough and cold. I had family come in for the holidays and I had to do my best to keep my distance from everyone. Couldn't even hold my brother's new grandbaby!My brother pulled a packet of Emergen C out of his pocket and told me to give it a try. He had been taking them for quick some time and said he was healthier than he had been in years.So I took it and picked up a box for myself and have been taking them ever since. I only take one packet a day (in the morning) unless I get that feeling that I might be coming down with something...then I will double up for a few days. It really does work!There are quite a few flavors available but I like the Super Orange the best.
