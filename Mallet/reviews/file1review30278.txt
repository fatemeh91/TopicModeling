review/text: I needed to replace my cordless B&D dustbuster that I had for about 3 years-so didn't last too long. I have a black lab and when I saw the reviews for this B&D pet series dustbuster, I decided to give it a shot. I am so glad I did, this is really an amazinlgy powerful dustbuster, easy to use and really does work getting up the pet hair. The cord is a good length, so anyone with stairs this would be ideal too.
