review/text: Bought this just to get the 25 dollar free shipping, and am back for another. This is by far the best dish and mug brush I have ever had (mind you I am not really a kitchen-y type). Anyway, I've had it a couple months now and am impressed after using it to scrub the rings (that never come off in the dishwasher) off coffee/tea mugs, cleaning pots, etc. Usually with other brushes the ends of the bristles get "mashed" looking fairly quickly, but this is holding up well - even after my son cleaned mud, spider webs and other debris off an old army helmet with it - (which is why I am buying another).
