review/text: I spent several months looking at trimmers with a couple of criteria:1. Rechargeable2. Able to create the 2-day look (ability to trim down to tiny lengths)After reading probably hundreds of reviews, I finally decided to order this one and go for it. Based on a general concensus of those reviews, the battery life was supposed to be great, it could trim hair down to minuscule stubble, and had a resounding reputation for its simplicity.Three months after receiving it, I am still highly satisfied and would not have changed my decision for any other similar price/quality ratio. In that entire time, I have used it around twice a week and have only had to recharge the unit two times. I definitely recommend this trimmer!
