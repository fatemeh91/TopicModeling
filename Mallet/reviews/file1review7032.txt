review/text: This is a very good and efficient shaver. This is a replacement for another Wahl shaver that I wore out over the years. Since I was sent TWO of them, having ordered ONE but was charged for two, I have a spare if anyone is interested. With three different shaving screens, it will deliver a shave for any type beard.
