review/text: I keep trying different variety of Spray n Wash, hoping it will work at cleaning spots on our clothes. Sadly, it doesn't seem to do much at all. Maybe on a very light, fresh dirt spot it will help, but on any kind of real spot (juice, ink, marker pen, grass, etc....)it seems to do nothing at all. Every year or so, I try a bottle of it, cause it's on sale, or just for wishfull thinking, but it never does much.I always get out a bottle of bleach, and that takes care of it. I just wish I didn't have to deal with the bleach, but at least it works on real spots.
