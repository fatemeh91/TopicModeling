review/text: This stuff really works for me! I have recommended it to everyone I know who gets colds.Take three of these huge tablets two or more times a day at the very first signs of a cold to ward off infection or lessen the symptoms.Before I learned about Wellness Formula, I got colds at every season. And at least one or two of them were very severe. When I take the tablets at the first signs, now I only develop colds once or twice a year, and the symptoms are much milder and manageable without the use of medications and their side-effects.Some people like to take one or two tablets daily to maintain their immune system. I find that it is better (and more economical) to take two tablets twice a day while travelling or when exposed to "cold-catching" conditions (infected persons, wet, damp weather or clothing, etc.)You will experience some mild "garlic breath" with this product, but you can take an internal breath freshener like Crystal Breath to get rid of it. Due to "volume pricing," you'll get a great price at Amazon, but if you're not yet convinced, you can try a small bottle first, available at many vitamin stores.
