review/text: I bought these diapers to use as dish towels since I had been using old birdseye diapers this way for many years because they are soft, smooth and very absorbent. They also tolerate being bleached every week. These that I got from Gerber were horrible quality fabric, rough, uneven, thin and the machine hems are uneven and ugly. These are no better than cheese cloth rags. I wish I knew where to get the real thing.
