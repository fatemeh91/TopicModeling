review/text: Update - Amazon are wonderful, they must have contacted this seller to edit their description as now it clearly states (single roll) and the picture of the box with the numeral "12" on the front has been replaced with a picture of single rolls of tape. Thank you Amazon.I ordered this product from KV Pet because the picture shows the front of the box that states it has 12 rolls in it and the description states:Product DescriptionHighest quality of porous adhesive tape. This tape allows the skin to breathe while providing a strong adhesive protection. Waterproof. Each roll is 10 yards long."EACH ROLL" implies more than one. A box arrived today with one roll loose in the box, dirty, used, unsanitary. It is medical tape for and it's filthy. I called them and they told me I got what I ordered. I have also contacted Amazon to tell them this is a dishonest seller.I have ordered many, many things from Amazon, this is my first bad experience.I gave the order one star because I couldn't submit my review without doing so.
