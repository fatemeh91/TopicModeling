review/text: I own alot of OXO products, but this one is not good. It tears very easily, we've replaced the brush at least 3 times. Also, while it soaps up well (as other types of these do), it only has a rough edge (see red in picture). You might not want to use a rough edge on everything you clean.OXO makes some fine products, but they need to go back to the design board with this one.
