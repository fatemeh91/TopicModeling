review/text: After suffering for over a year with intense stomach problems and losing over 30 lbs. in two months because I wasn't able to eat, I found a book that saved my life. It is called Gut Solutions by Renew Life. Even my gastroenterologist, who looked at me one day and said "I just don't know where to go from here with you", was amazed at my improvement after reading this book and taking the recommended supplements. I used to suffer from frequent yeast infections too but not anymore. The pre and probiotics in this Fiber Smart cured that and the wonderful sources of fiber in this product helped too. I would recommend any Renew Life product and especially their book Gut Solutions to anyone suffering from stomach issues.
