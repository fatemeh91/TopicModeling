review/text: This is an excellent quality protein product, I used to drink ON 100% whey, but I discovered that Dymatize Elilte Whey tastes better, is cheaper and has the same nutritional facts. So I have a year taking this product and I'm very happy, the best flavor is vanilla, second caf&eacute; mocha, third chocolate and chocolate mint, I didn't like strawberry at all.
