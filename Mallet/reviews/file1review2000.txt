review/text: "Stress is known to burn up vitamins like crazy. It's another reason to take well above the minimum requirement because of the losses." ~James W. IngoldsbyALL ONE products are my favorite supplements because they come in powder and tablet versions and the ingredients are pure. There are no sweeteners, flavorings or other unnecessary ingredients. ALL ONE was formulated to promote "optimal" health, not just minimal health. The RDA and RDI are based on research that helps to prevent nutritional deficiencies like scurvy or beriberi. You will notice that many of the ingredients have high percentages in the daily value column.The first week I tried these products, I noticed a difference in my energy levels. You can take the powders in the afternoon for an energy boost.When my husband travels, I put these tablet vitamins in his travel bag. Since I'm not there to mix up his vitamin potions, this is a perfect way to keep him healthy while traveling. If you love the All One vitamin powders, you will find the same high-quality ingredients in the tablet form. They are sustained release tablets and there are 210 tablets in each bottle.Ingredients (the full list from the bottle):Vitamin A (as Beta Carotene) 6,250IU 125% Daily ValueVitamin A (as Vitamin A Palmitate) 10,000IU 200%Vitamin C(as Ascorbic Acid) 750mg 1250%Vitamin D(as Ergocalciferol) 500IU 125%Vitamin E(as d-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate) 300IU 1000%Vitamin K(as Phytonadione) 5mcg 6%Vitamin B 1(Thiamine HCL) 12.5mg 833%Vitamin B 2 (as Riboflavin) 12.5mg 735%Niacin 50mg 250%Vitamin B 6 (Pyridoxine HCL) 12.5mg 625%Folic Acid 400mcg 100%Vitamin B-12(as Cyanocobalamin) 125mcg 2083%d-Biotin 75mcg 25%Pantothenic Acid (as d-Calcium Pantothenate) 100mg 1000%Calcium (as Calcium Carbonate, Dicalcium Phosphate) 350 mg 35%Iron (Iron Sulfate) 15mg 83%Phosphorus (Dicalcium Phosphate) 100mg 10%Iodine (Kelp) 125 mcg 83%Magnesium (Magnesium Oxide) 175 mg 44%Zinc (Zinc Oxide) 25 mg 166%Selenium (Sodium Selenite) 50 mcg 70%Copper (Oxide) 0.1 mg 5%Maganese (Carbonate) 5 mg 250%Chromium (Chloride) 50 mcg 42%Molybdenum (Proteinate) 50 mcg 67%Potassium (Potassium Chloride) 95 mg 3%Lemon Bioflavonoids (lemon fruit) 400 mgCholine (Choline Bitartrate) 100 mgLecithin (as Soy Lecithin) 100 mgInositol 100mgPara Amino Benzoic Acid 50 mgRutin 50 mgHesperidin Complex (citrus fruit) 50 mgVegetable Oil 7 mgGum Guar 7 mgOther Ingredients: Whey, Soy Protein Isolate, Silicon dioxide, Vegetable Magnesium Stearate, Vegetable Stearic Acid, Microcrystalline Cellulose and Croscarmellose Sodium.Suggested Use:Adults - 7 tablets dailyChildren - 2 to 4 tablets depending on ages listed on bottle.
