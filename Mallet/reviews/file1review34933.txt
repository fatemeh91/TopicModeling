review/text: This product works great. I take Lunesta two nights a week and this the rest of the week. It makes me sleepy in about an hr. I can say it works probably as good as Lunesta (however i'm on the lowest dose). It doesn't give me RLS like Benadryl or the Lunesta. My bf reports no kicking. lol
