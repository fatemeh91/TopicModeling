review/text: After feeling very sluggish and always tired before the end of my long days, I started taking these capsules after reading the research done on them, and after a couple weeks taking them I started to notice a big difference. I was resting better at night and waking up BEFORE the alarm went off, ready to start the day. I haven't checked my cholesterol since I have been taking them but feel certain it is better than it was. I take 2-4 pills a day and sometimes a half bottle of juice on top of that and my energy level has certainly gone up from where it was.We gave some of these to a neighbor battling Parkinson's and after a couple weeks they have reported very positive results, feeling better, more energy, working again, as well as other things.
