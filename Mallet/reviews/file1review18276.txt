review/text: This product has made my life sooooo much better. I love the consistency--silky, smooth, and I've never had a problem with it drying. Doesn't burn, and I have very sensitive skin. The most amazing part of this product is how well it moisturized and lubricated my poor postpartum, hormone-ravaged self. If you have dryness, whether postpartum, menopausal, or just occasional, you really should give this a try. And as for the price--I've had the same bottle for almost 3 years, and I've used maybe 1/10, and I'm very liberal with it. Fabulous product.
