review/text: I've always had difficulty falling asleep (the dreaded "snowball" effect) and trouble staying asleep. I thought about trying the prescription sleep aides like Ambien and Lunesta, but have heard unpleasant stories from friends and colleagues (sleepwalking and memory loss were the most common side effects they talked about). Anyway, I started taking this at night, and have never slept so well in my life!! The only side effect I was bothered by was that I had really vivid dreams for the first few nights. Be prepared for it; it's very common. It does go away and was never bad enough for me to stop taking it. It's a small price to pay for a good night's sleep, am I right?
