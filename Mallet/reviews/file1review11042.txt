review/text: I am an avid bow hunter and hunting success requires getting up close and personal with the quarry. Human scent of any kind is always a concern and must be eliminated to the fullest extent possible. I mainly hunt whitetail deer and wild hog. Both have a tremendous sense of smell and require one to be within 20-30 yards for a clean harvest.I have taken chlorophyll products internally for years to reduce human scent and they work extremely well.It is said that you are what you eat. As a hunter (particularly a bow hunter or even a wildlife photographer), you must reduce or eliminate the odor the food you consume produces through breath, digestive gases and scent via skin pores, as much as possible. Chlorophyll gel caps (ChloroFresh) do just that.Chlorophyll gel caps are a must-have for sportsmen.
