review/text: I have been looking for a well made beard trimmer for quite sometime now. I decided to check here on amazon as well as a few other sites before making the purchase. I checked and read alot of reviews and the average for most seemed around 3-4 stars. I decided to take the chance on this remington as I liked the idea of having the adjustment built in. Upon arriving It seemed like a quality trimmer for the price. I have already used it a few times and it has worked great. I love how just turning the wheel you can put it on whatever adjustment you may need without fiddling around with clips. At first I was concerned that it would not shave smooth because of the plastic head. I soon found out the plastic top pops right off if you want just the razor itself to give you a close trim. The only con I can see is the top cover that is used for the adjustment is made of plastic. It seems durable enough but if it breaks it seems then the only thing this would be good for is a close shave. Overall for the price of 15$ it is well worth what I paid!
