review/text: We have a home with a high roof line and in some places it is over 20 feet high. We get the occasional wasp or hornet or yellow jacket nest and this is the best product I have found to use to kill them. The can itself will spray up to 22 feet and held above my head it is going up to 30 feet. This spray instantly knocks the wasps out of the air and they literally die almost instantly. It is the best insecticide I have found for this type of pest and it does the job perfectly.Be sure to follow all the instructions listed on the can and shown below. My latest surprise was I lifted the lid to the hose reel last week an there was a large hornets nest inside the compartment where we keep our extra hose spray nozzles. The next time I raised the lid, the wasps got the surprise. Not one survived or was able to fly out of the nest. It was over that quick.It is nice to kill these pests so quickly and from such a distance. They don't even have a chance to find you and sting you. This is a great product and I recommend it to you!
