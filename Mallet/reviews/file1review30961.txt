review/text: I've been having shoulder and hand aches and pains for about a year now and thought I would try this to see if it would help. I've been taking it for two weeks and after one week was amazed at the difference this has made! I still have a little achiness but NOTHING like it was before. I will keep taking this as long as it helps which I have a feeling it will based on the reviews here. Try it a bottle of this...what do you have to lose except your pain??
