review/text: I want to rate these masks higher. They block out the light perfectly, they fit the face well, they're attractive. I kinda love them. However, the lining peels up after just a few months of use. I have to wonder if something changed with manufacturing because the first mask I bought lasted MUCH longer than the last 2 (I'm on mask #4). If you don't mind considering them as something you'll have to replace after about 8 months, then I'd totally recommend them. They do the job very, very well...while they last.
