review/text: I have a collection of three very different washable nursing pads along with some disposable ones. The Avent nursing pads are my favorite they are so soft and I know which side goes inward (a mystery with Nuk). I also use Nuk - horrible - stiff and thin and some 100% organic cotton pads thick and soft but they fold up in the wash and don't dry well. I love my Avent pads and go through them first and want to wash laundry right then.
