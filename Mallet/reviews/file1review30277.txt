review/text: this thing as a quick touch up vac and as a pet hair remover is second to none. can't beat the power. the bristles in the turbo brush are rubber and really pulls any embedded pet fur right out with no problem. i have really long hair that wraps around the turbo brush, but i've found that if i use the vac alone or with the hose attachment first, i can then finish up with the turbo brush to leave my bathroom completely hair free.
