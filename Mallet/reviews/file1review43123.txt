review/text: I have a baby with some reflux issues, so I do a lot of laundry. This does a good job of getting things clean even without pre-treating, more than I can say for most laundry detergents. Occasionally I have a stain that doesn't come out in the first wash so I throw it the in dirty laundry pile again. Even after drying, the stains come out after the second wash. And the clean baby scent lingers even after drying.
