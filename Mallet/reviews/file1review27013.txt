review/text: I used this for 2 years after gastric bypass surgery, and it was definitely the best-tasting powder out there, and was highly recommended by just about everyone. For those concerned about bloating I find that the common method or either blending or shaking adds too much air / bubbles. My recommendation is to stir instead. I also have a great tip to improve taste... keep it cold! Glass bottles make a big difference. Plastic containers don't keep it cold enough. The glass bottles that those Starbucks Frappuchino drinks comes in, I found, are the perfect size for a shake, and they're highly portable. They come in a 4-pack. After sitting a while, all it needs is a few swirls (with cap on!) and you can see the bottom to know when you've gotten it all off the bottom. You can wash the glasses and lids and keep using them. I pour my mix into these bottles, and go from there. Here's my tip for the best way to mix:Stir with a fork in a glass measuring cup. First add a little milk to make a paste. Then add more milk GRADUALLY, little by little, while continuing to stir, until you get the desired amount. Making a paste first is essential. If you just dump your powder into a large glass of milk, it will clump. Pour your shakes into above-mentioned glass bottles.I reiterate that using a blender or shaking it adds too much air. Sometimes people like this effect because it gives it more of a cake batter or milkshake feel, but for me it adds to much air that can affect gasiness and/or bloating.Also, use with milk. It won't taste good with water.
