review/text: Not only is this product great for removing icky sticky oowey gooey messes from any surface, even delicate ones, but it can sit out of the package and still keep working for some time. I opened one once but didn't use it right away. When I did use it three days later it worked perfectly. It didn't dry out at all. One little pad can do a major clean up job, too. The other great thing about it is that it has a pleasant orange fragrance. I keep a few pads everywhere. Love it!
