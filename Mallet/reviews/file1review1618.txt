review/text: i had a 3mm skin tab on each eyelid. a dermatologist had frozen them off in the past, but they kept coming back, so i figured it was time for some self help. i drilled an 1/8" hole in a plastic spoon to press lightly against my eyelid and isolate the tab from the surrounding skin, then used a Q-Tip with the cotton ball ends cut off, to apply a bit of Pedifix wax. i did this several times each day for 2 weeks as the skin tab culiflower'd by turning white bulbus hard and finally fell off leaving a smaller nub that later scabbed and healed. on the other eyelid i simply used aCuticle Clipper by Premax. Made in Italyand 5x mirror to pull and snipe the skintab off - it was a bit painful and bloody (do not use a styptic pencil to stop the blood), but it clouted within 10 minutes and after cleanup was left with a 2mm scab (clean area with alcohol then relieve and relax skin with petroleum gel). both eyelids healed up looking the same, but I'll probably just snipe it off next time than go through the 2-3 daily lightly burning ritual of putting this wax on. so if you have a high pain thresh hold and steady hand, just cut the skin tab off - if not, this wax and some persistence may save you the expense of going to a doctor.
