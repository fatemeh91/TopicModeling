review/text: I used this product for three months and was able to conceive a healthy baby boy. Now that he's 15 months we're trying again and using FertilAid. It's been 3 months and we haven't gotten pregnant yet but I have had my first 29 day cycle in about 8 years. Before my cycles were anywhere from 35-48 days. Here's hoping that since my cycles is starting to regulate that another pregnancy is around the corner.
