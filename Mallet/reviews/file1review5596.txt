review/text: I usually buy these brushes in local stores. But recently I can't find any in the stores, so went online and found this one.Placed the order on Saturday, shipped out on Monday, and received on Thursday.I put one on the handle. It felt the same as the old ones I had used before.The only downside is the wire broke after three days, while the old ones could last a week. Maybe my using style has changed? Will see how the rest last.Highly recommended.
