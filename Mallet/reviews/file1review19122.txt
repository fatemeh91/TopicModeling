review/text: I wanted to save money from buying the OPK's at the drug store and thought I woudl give them a shot. I wanted to see if these were accurate so I tested using Clear Blue Easy digital OPK and these into the same urine sample. CBE came up positive 1 full day before these did. They aren't as sensitive as they claim.
