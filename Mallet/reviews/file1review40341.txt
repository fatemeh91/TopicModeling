review/text: With a product like this, I'd want to replicate results before giving five stars, so I'll go with four stars for now.For best effectiveness, you need to start taking this product when you feel the first little symptom of illness. That means you need to already have it on hand when you start to get sick.For me the first sign that something's coming on is always just a hint of a scratchy throat. If I start using a powerful echinacea product immediately, I can usually avoid any further symptoms. In the past I've used ground echinacea root grown by family friends, which is much more potent than any commercially available. After using one bottle, I'd say this Quick Defense is every bit as effective at preventing further symptoms. It may be even more effective than the echinacea root alone, but I'd have to try it again to be sure.I should add that the only consistent effectiveness I've found in using echinacea is for preventing or reducing the severity of colds. I tend to doubt its usefulness for more serious conditions.This preparation is said to be a synergistic blend that works better than echinacea by itself. Along with the echinacea, it includes andrographis leaf, elderberry, and ginger root.This stuff seems costly when you consider that one bottle only lasts you one go-round. You take all 20 caps in two days. But if you have a special event coming up -- a vacation, wedding, or performance -- and it keeps you from getting sick, you might decide it was worth having around. The bottle I got gave an expiration date of August 2014, so you can buy in advance and keep it around till you need it.The capsules are vegetarian, and each 2 capsules contain 5,200 mg dry herb equivalent. The box warns against use during pregnancy or lactation.
