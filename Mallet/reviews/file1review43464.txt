review/text: My dad's Cardiologist suggested that I get my dad a smaller blood pressure monitor "cuff" to more accurately measure my dad's pressure. The monitor he already had did not accommodate a smaller cuff. After some research, the Omron HEM-711AC Monitor seemed perfect for my dad's needs. Not only would it take a smaller cuff, the large read out helped my dad read his pressure and pulse more easily and accurately. I would highly recommend this monitor.
