review/text: This little guy works best on smooth floors, e.g. picks up cat litter in bathroom just fine. Not so hot on carpets. However, when I go to empty the trays, I am amazed at what it DID pick up. So, better than nothing between vacuum sessions.The trick handle ought to get an award for stupid design. Don't they test this stuff? I put the double tape on as one reviewer suggested. That wokrs.
