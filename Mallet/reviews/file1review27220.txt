review/text: I've been buying Optimum Nutrition's whey protein for a few years now and I believe it is high quality whey protein, but . . .I am extremely disappointed with the way the company is JACKING UP THE PRICES. The price of this stuff on Amazon four months ago was $50 for a 10 pound bag - now it's $79! The price has skyrocked up 60% in the last four months - this is ridiculous!If they don't come back to reality and drop their prices down soon I'm going to have to look for something else - Optimum Nutrition is doing a MAJOR DISSERVICE to their long-time customers.
