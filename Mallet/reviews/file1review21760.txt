review/text: After bringing my daughter home from the hospital I discover her skin was to sensitive to use baby wipes. Thank goodness for PeeWees - Disposable Dry Washcloths. I use them instead of baby wipes and my daughter's bottom have yet to turn red or received a rash. A also use them to wash her face because PeeWees Washcloths are softer than regular washcloths. They're bigger too! The only downfall to this product is there are only 24 in a box. Which means baby wipes are a lot cheater.
