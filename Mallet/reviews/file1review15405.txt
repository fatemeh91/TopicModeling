review/text: I have been gradually losing hair in last 5 years. I wasn't using any hair oil or gel. One of my friends suggested that i should look into Bhringaraj Oil for hair falling and hair weakness. I have been using this product for almost a year now and notice stronger hair. This however doesn't do any miracle and grow new hair, but it does help with strengthening existing hair. One other thing i like about this oil is that it doesn't leave any bad smell.
