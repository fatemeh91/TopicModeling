review/text: This is a piece of poorly constructed junk. There are 2 very small prongs that hold the blade in place. When you remove the guard and clean the blade of your hair, they break. Thus making the trimmer only useable if you manually hold the blade down, or makes it loose under the guard.Remington must have outsourced not only quality control, but engineering to China.Terrible. Can not reccommend anyone ever buy this piece of junk.
