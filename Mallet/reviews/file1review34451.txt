review/text: My wife and I have been using this product for a few years and it is super slippery and peforms great. I'm not sure what Amazon's policies are on explicitness so I will try to be discrete while still getting the point across here. I would not recommend this for "alternate entry" because it is so hard to wash off. She doesn't like it in her at all. We only use it now for her great hand skills ;) That way it is "on" us and not "in" us. We use the other Wet products for other activities (both the Wet regular and Wet light).
