review/text: THIS WORKS!The only prep you need is to plug it in and brush the hair out from under the wheel occasionally. (No running water, shaving cream, razors, warming wax, or any of those other time consuming bothers) Yes, it stings. It's no more painful then waxing. In fact, it's LESS. If the pain gets to much just stop for a moment, wait for the irritation to die down, then go at it again. As long as you take it slow you won't have irritated skin for more than a minute after you stop using the epilator. (unless you have really sensitive skin. But still, the shock is a lot less than waxing)It doesn't pinch, just takes the hair. Missed some? No problem! Run over the area again and catch what was missed! Can't do that with waxing.Not only that, but for the price of one upper lip wax you can buy an epilator that will pay for itself after one use! No more trips to the salon, no more razors, no more shaving cream, no more wax, no more hassle!
