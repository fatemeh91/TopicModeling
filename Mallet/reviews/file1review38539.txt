review/text: Ok the only reason I'm giving this 3 stars is because I'm sure it works just like any other Listerine. That said, this is the worst flavored mouthwash I have ever had in my life. I can't begin to explain the bizarre aftertaste this leaves in your mouth...it literally tastes like you just put sewer antiseptic stuff in your mouth. I've had many many many kinds of mouthwashes, please believe me when I say this is the most awful tasting one I have EVER encountered. I drank water and coke but the taste still lingers after 10 minutes, it would probably be a lot longer if I didn't drink the soda. I'm debating just tossing this entire bottle because it's so bad. Avoid this version of Listerine at all costs unless you are trying to punish whoever has to use this awful stuff.
