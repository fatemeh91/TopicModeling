review/text: I only bought this because I spend a lot of my time leaning over and slouching when I am at my drawing board or computer for several hours, so I wanted something to support my back, and align it into a healthy posture, and this looked the least awkward looking device.I expected it to be uncomfortable at first, until I get used to it; but this is treatment by torture.Since this comes with no instructions what so ever, I followed the advice of one of the other reviewers who said you should wear it OVER a T-shirt, so I put it on and headed to the library for a test drive.After 10 minutes I started feeling numbness in my forearms and tingling in my fingers (although It was on the lowest possible pressure and I am a relatively thin person ) it was pressing so hard it cut off the circulation to my arms and hands,My shoulder was sore for 2 days after that incidence.I decided to give it another chance so I wore it under the T-shirt in direct contact with the skin, this time it actually fitted , and I didn't get a the numbness again.However, I think there is something wrong with the design, it is supposed to straighten your back by pulling your scapulas back and down, this means that the elastic pulling material should be between your shoulder blades; instead, the elastics here are the rings surrounding the shoulders (if you look at the product photo on this page you'll see what I mean) so all the pressure and pull is concentrated in this area, which explains the sore armpits you get after wearing it for even a short time.And since there is nothing supporting it from the opposite direction, whenever you move your arms it begins to ride up your neck, and begins to pull your shoulders upward.It is a real shame, because this product is small and could have been a great thing with a few minor adjustments, like padding the shoulder straps (they feel like rubber bands under your arm pits) and having a frontal strap to align it and prevent is from riding.In conclusion, it only works by painfully reminding you to "...Straighten your back and don't slouch!" you get the same effect by staying at your mothers'!
