review/text: My mid-priced Hotpoint dishwasher is 16 years old. I've been using the Dishwasher Magic twice a year for 10 years and (knock on wood) the dishwasher is still pluggin' along. We have very hard water in Greentucky and this keeps the lime-scale from building up near where the pump is located. When using this you do have to make sure your water temp is hot enough, otherwise the wax plug inside the opening of the bottle won't melt and dispense the product.
