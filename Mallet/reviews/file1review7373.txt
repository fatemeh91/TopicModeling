review/text: I do a lot of city walking, on rare occasions up to 20 miles a day. That much footstrike on hard concrete and asphalt is much harder on the feet than relatively soft dirt trails, so I'm forever looking for the perfect insole. I miss my old Sorbothane insoles (100% Sorbothane from heel to toe), which were heavy but very comfortable. These are the next best thing. They have one of the deepest heel cups I've found on any insole. The only way to get more heel support is with wraparound Tuli heel cups. Arch support isn't quite as high as I'd like, but too high would be uncomfortable for many people, like stepping on a rounded rock with each step.Too bad these aren't more durable. After about five months of use, the plastic frames that hold all the various foam inserts has cracks in many places. It'll probably last another three or four months, but I wish Spenco (or rather their Chinese contractor) had used a tougher, less brittle plastic for the frames.
