review/text: I have been suffering from hemorrhoids since i was a teenager. This problem runs in my family. It got worse when i was pregnant. The doctor prescribed me some cream but it didnt help at all. I thought i had to have surgery after the baby was born. Then, it got a little better after i gave birth to my daughter. Suddenly, it got so much worse last week since i got constipated. I was in so much pain, i could not walk or sleep. I cried every time i went to the bathroom. I had to wake up in the middle of the night to sit in warm water in the bathtub since the pain was so excruciating. I was sooo desperate and hopeless since i thought the only way out is surgery. I went online to order some hemorrhoids wipes and this came up. After reading all the reviews, thought i might give it a try. Let me tell you, after just one use, the pain was 90% gone. I felt like a brand new person. I am able to enjoy life and playing with my newborn now. Thanks so much for this cream, it is like a gift from heaven for hemorrhoids suffering people. Thanks thanks thanks!!!!! oh, and i actually like the smell :)
