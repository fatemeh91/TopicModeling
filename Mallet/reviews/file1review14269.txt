review/text: This product has good intentions, but unfortunately it is limited by design. Because the nozzle is on the bottom of the unit, and it hangs a foot below your shower head pipe, it only covers about 2/3 to 3/4 of the height of the shower. One advantage is the top of the bottle probably can be used to hold bar soap, but most people don't use that anymore anyway.Obviously it was in their best interest to allow gravity to help pump the fluid out, but it is less effective for cleaning. Also, the nozzle angle isn't adjustable, so it's always pointed down.I probably have an ideal shower for this product, it is square, no curtain, and is a dedicated shower. But even then, don't believe this is a cleaner. My shower wasn't that dirty before, but even after using this thing for a couple weeks, there wasn't really an improvement. But, after cleaning it myself, so far it does seem to be fairly good at maintaining that cleanliness, except for the top part of course.Oh, and the fluid does go quite quickly.Another thing that was a negative for this product was that their was a $5 off coupon for the product inside the box. I don't need another one, and you can't see that there is a coupon in there when you buy it.All that aside, I haven't had any problems with batteries dying quickly or anything else mechanically or electronically not working. . .yet. It also does leave a nice smell, which is probably why it's getting 3 stars from me instead of 2.
