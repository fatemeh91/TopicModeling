review/text: I was very pleased w/this particular protein drink. I cannot have lactose products and have difficulty finding a protein drink that doesn't upset the stomach. This one doesn't. The taste is good & it mixes better than many brands (We use a fork instead of spoon to mix!) I carefully scrutinized the ingredients, the nutritional value etc. and found this particular brand/type to be the best overall and the most tolerable on the stomach. The price was competitive, too. Good purchase...
