review/text: I had two gapping wounds after my abdominal incision opened up after major surgery. They were 3cm deep and one was 7cm long. They got worse before slowly getting better. Not much progress for a month. I started using the Arginaid and saw more progress in one week than the entire previous month and every three days (when bandages were changed) we could actually measure the progress. After two weeks larger wound was only 1cm deep and 4 cm long. Would definitely recomend this product.
