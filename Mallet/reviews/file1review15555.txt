review/text: Let me start by stating that I don't normally write reviews. The rare occasion I write a review is if a product is exceptional or horrible. Unfortunately, these are not exceptional. I am reviewing the product, not the purchase through Amazon.I purchased these batteries based on what I thought would be a good price deal. I'm a bilateral BTH wearer and I usually buy batteries from Costco in bulk or single packs from one of the chain drug stores. Those batteries typically last for a full week, both name and drug store brands. I wear my aids from the time I wake up until the time I go to bed. When they are out the battery case is opened so the batteries don't drain.The first of THESE batteries I used lasted for a whopping 1 HOUR before my aid started signaling that the battery was dying. The second of THESE batteries did not work AT ALL. I've gone through 2 packs already in about 2 weeks because most of the batteries are either duds or last for less than 3 days. There are times when a new battery was just put in and my aid will immediately start signaling its dying and I open & close the battery case a few times and then its fine. I'm constantly worrying that they are going to die unexpectedly though.Going through these batteries as fast as I am means that the good deal I THOUGHT I was getting isn't so. Save your money - buy the batteries you usually do, not these.
