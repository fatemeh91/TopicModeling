review/text: Magnesium Orotate is suppose to be on of the best forms of magnesium since it is it's natural form and is suppose to be easily assimilated, much better than many others forms. This form is more expensive, and the TABLETS ARE HUGE.I give this a four star because you usually don't find orotate with this high a mg tablet so you'd have to take more usually, but this large tablet allows you to get what you need in one tablet. Hint, for swallowing, put it in your mouth and wash it around a little first, then it will go down easier with water. There is no bad taste and the tablet has a smooth finish that doesn't just melt in your mouth or anything.
