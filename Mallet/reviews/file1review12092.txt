review/text: I have been taking these vitamins for almost a year now and for some reason these are the only vitamins that I have ever taken tht actually gives me energy... Im not pregnant but Im 29 and I do plan on having another baby within the next couple of years. So these will be taken before and during pregnancy... Also my nails dont chip as much and my hair grows quicker after its cut! BE AWARE, these vitamins do cause gas but I just take it with a ginger root vitamin and there is no gas.. But overall, im a continous user and I love these vitamins! Heard the 800 mcg of folic acid and the 15mg of zinc helps to have healthy baby!
