review/text: I lost 3.5" off of my waist in the 3 weeks I was on Animal Cuts. I could tell my body temp. was up. The only negative side effects were thirst (and associated frequent peeing) and my burps tasting like cayanne pepper. Oh, and I'd get jittery if I took the morning dose and drank coffee but didn't eat - only made that mistake once.You won't lose weight just from popping the pills; you have to exercise and reduce your portion sizes. If you do those two things, though, Animal Cuts will amplify your fat loss.
