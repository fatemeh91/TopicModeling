review/text: This is the second one I bought and it is better than my first (epilady) and third (braun) and even subsequent emjoi epilators. Size and shape fits comfortably in the hand and helps give maximum angle versatility, power/strength is great, tweezer heads can be used at various angles and still epliate effectively. The motor action also has a solid feel and sound (rather than hollow, shakey, and rickety like some.) Although I have gone on to try other Emjoi models (Emagine, Light Caress), this one remains the undefeated champ for strength and angle flexibility.
