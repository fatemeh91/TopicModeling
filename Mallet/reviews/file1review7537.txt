review/text: I have been a longtime customer of 'My Lip Stuff' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products. I have over 30 of her lip balms and they all have wonderful texture and my lips have never been healthier or smoother. All the scents are accurate, especially once you put it on, it releases all the nuances of each flavor... I also have used her linen spray, whipped body lotion and the body butter stick and it's all wonderful! Try everything, you will like it for sure!
