review/text: When I read the daily doses on the box, I decided that I was not going to take these pills:Vit A 572% DV; Vit C 745% DV; Vit E 1334% DV; Zinc 464% DV; Copper 80% DV. This was way overdosing except for the copper. I already have a healthful diet which gives me some of the vitamins and minerals included in this medicine and take lutein/zeaxanthin for my eyes.
