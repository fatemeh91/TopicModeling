review/text: I am the kind of guy who researches a lot before buying anything, and since I needed a trimmer for the first time, started reading up some reviews. This one had the absolute best reviews, and the price was great too! Bought this after reading up reviews for a week(Dont want to bloody up my nose after all!) and its a really good product. Cuts the hair close, doesnt cut anything else:d..The nose feels raw after using this, which I guess means its doing a good job of cutting the hair. You need to clean up your nose after a trim(the cut hair tends to stick inside) but thats a minor irritant. Does its job well, and for the price, its a great product! Looks like I need to get a Panasonic Shaver too now.
