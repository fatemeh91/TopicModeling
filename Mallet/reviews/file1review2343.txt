review/text: I've been diagnosed with dry eye caused by LASIK and menopause. I used Restasis for a couple of years, but it was expensive and stung, and had stopped working. I was pretty desperate. A different optometrist suggested these. He said other patients reported that they cured their dry eye. It took a few weeks, but I no longer have dry eyes. I've missed a day here and there with no ill effects, but if I miss several days in a row my eyes do feel dry again. Very slight fishy taste afterwards, but not nearly as bad as other Omega 3's I've taken. This has been pretty much of a miracle cure for me. I have them on auto-reorder here at Amazon so I never run out. They are a little hard to find in retail stores.
