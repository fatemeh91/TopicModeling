review/text: The floss is really smooth, and doesn't break up and get stuck in those tight spaces between your teeth. I also like the mint taste -- it's fresh and clean tasting, not stale like some other unmentioned brands tend to be! The only thing I'd want to be different is the fact that it tends to get a bit sticky if you get water on it, but with careful use it's no big deal. All said, I really like this stuff and would definitely get it again.
