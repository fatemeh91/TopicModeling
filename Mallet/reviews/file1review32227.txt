review/text: One of my friends introduced me to this product several years ago and I fell in love. Smells great, works wonderfully. I use it on the desk, the bookcases (laminate) and I don't have to be afraid of the cats walking on it and then cleaning their paws. Even better, the male counterpart, who is very scent sensitive, has no problems with the light citrusy smell.
