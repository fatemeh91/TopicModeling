review/text: I just got mine for Christmas, I'll say i have never had a shave that close befor. In fact my face was not this smooth as a child. I love this razor. Now at first be prepared to cut your self due to how heavey it is but you will soon get used to that. Then you will love it too. Besides it is built to out last me.
