review/text: My wife has allergies, and always had a reaction to the other glycerin/jelly products that are on the market. She would complain that they hurt, stung, etc. This product does not irritate her skin, is easy to use bedside because of the pump, and just one push of the pump is all we need. It works well, has nice glide to it, and cleans up nicely. Almost feels a bit more a dairy cream than a personal lubricant. Highly recommended!!!
