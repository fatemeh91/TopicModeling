review/text: I like the way it feels and I keep the container in the freezer, as suggested. I've been an Amazon subscribe & save user of this for over a year. However, about halfway through (on multiple tubs) it gets a progressively worse taste and not nearly as fresh at the beginning. I'm suspecting that the tub itself is not very good for in the freezer and need to put in a different storage container. Anyone else have same experiences or storage suggestions?
