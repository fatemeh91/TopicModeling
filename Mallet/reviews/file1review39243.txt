review/text: These clippers will pay for themselves over and over again. I was paying $15-20 a whop for my sons hair cuts. I watched a few Youtube videos and this set had everyhting I needed to experiment, practice and also fix small mistakes I made while in the learning and creative process. Now, I can cut and my sons can cut their own heads and make a little change cutting other kids hair in the subdivision. This was a great investment.
