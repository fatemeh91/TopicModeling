review/text: I have been using these a few years and noticed several negative comments about low pressure/volume.I think the main problem is due to the small hole in the rubber grommet-plug in the resevoir.I reamed mine out a bit with a small clean drill bit and now get good flow.As a test fill resevoir with water,pull out the jet and you should be able to suck out some water easily.Than put the jet in the sink and the water should continue to flow freely.If not the hole needs to be opened up
