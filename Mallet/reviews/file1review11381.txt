review/text: Ensure High Protein Complete Balanced Nutrition Drink, Ready to Use, Creamy Milk Chocolate, 24- 8 Fluid Ounce Bottles....This Nutrition drink is very tasty and gives you no aftertaste. My Doctor recommended it because my Protein level was below normal and malnurished. I now have it regularly through Amazon. The Vanilla is ok if thats all they have, just add some Ovaltine to it and shake,tastes great! Good substitute if they run out of Chocolate,because i drank it all HA-HA
