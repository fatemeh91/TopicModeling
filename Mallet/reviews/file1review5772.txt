review/text: My daughter HATES taking these. The ingredients are great and natural, but my daughter cannot stand taking them because of the smell and taste (even though she has to swallow them). The other thing is that your kid has to take 2 of them a day, not 1. I'd rather give my daughter 1 with everything in it and be done! Will order something different next time.
