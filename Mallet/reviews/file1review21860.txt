review/text: Don't waste your money on this product. A small ice pack and ace wrap will work just as well. The ice component on this wrap is nothing more than small packets of freezable material sewn into the length of the sleeve. Once these packets freeze it hurts to apply it to your (already sore) shin when pulling into place. Several reviews have complained about how difficult it is to apply - place your foot and calf inside a plastic shopping bag. Pull the shin splint on into place and then pull the plastic bag off your foot. The plastic makes it easier to slid the neoprene on. Hope this helps.
