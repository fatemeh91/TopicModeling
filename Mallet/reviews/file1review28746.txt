review/text: I've been using ON whey for a couple years now. Through heavy lifting and high protein intake, I have had immense strength gains. The ON protein seems to work well, it mixes well, and tastes relatively good. (Not many protein powders taste good, but that's not the point. You aren't eating it for taste. You are eating it to PWN ALL NOOBS. Grow up and chug.)Toodles,B
