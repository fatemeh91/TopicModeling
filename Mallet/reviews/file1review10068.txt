review/text: I really love my heated stones. I add water to the bowl right before I put the kids to bed and they are ready as soon as everyone has gotten settled. I was concerned that sometimes they didn't seem to retain their heat. Now, I put a light weight blanket over myself and it seems to help. My sister also used these on her lower back when she was pregnant and she loved it.
