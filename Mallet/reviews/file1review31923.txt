review/text: I bought the Garden of Life Perfect Food after trying Kyo-Green and loving it, but wanting something more complete or beneficial. I actually loved the taste of the Kyo-Green. This stuff was another story. I'm not real finicky about taste, and I know I'm doing it just for the benefits, but this stuff was pretty bad. Kind of a strange fishy odor/taste, maybe from the spirulina? It's not a huge issue, but I always have to have orange juice or grapefruit juice to kill it. The pulp in these helps you ignore any lumps of powder in there too. It's not easy to mix.I recovered MUCH faster from a cold than my loved ones after taking this religiously. I believe it was because of this product. It's good! Cheaper than some, but I think I'll go with something else next time.
