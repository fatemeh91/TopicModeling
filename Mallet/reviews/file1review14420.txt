review/text: I went on a cruise recently and I am subject to sea sickness. I put this on whenever I was feeling a bit sick. However, it was hard to tell if I was feeling better because the boat stopped rocking as much, or because of the Motioneaze. But who cares, I felt better. I would say that the bottle is pretty small, so if you use it a lot it will run out fast.
