review/text: I started taking FertilAid to increase our chances of conceiving. Although I had read some negative reviews from women with regular cycles, I chose to take the risk because of all of the stories of successful pregnancies. I chose poorly. This product THREW MY NORMAL 28-DAY CYCLE COMPLETELY OUT OF WHACK! My cycle was so out of sync (1-2 weeks late) that I thought I must be pregnant. Well, I wasn't pregnant. What I was, however, was utterly frustrated. After 3 months I threw in the towel and returned to taking my regular prenatal vitamins.I would HIGHLY DISCOURAGE anyone with a NORMAL CYCLE from taking these supplements. You'll just waste more time waiting for your body to get back on track.
