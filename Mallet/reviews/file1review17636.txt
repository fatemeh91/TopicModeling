review/text: I bought this trimmer after looking at various cheap trimmers and i have to say i am not dissapointed. the charge lasts forever, the trimmer is lightweight and easy to grip. It trims like it should, and the blades are self sharpening so no oiling necessary. All in all im very happy with my purchase, i am only a teenager though so my facial hair is no that thick yet and it may not do well on thicker beards, but it works great for me. I would definately recommend this to anybody looking for an inexpensive trimmer.
