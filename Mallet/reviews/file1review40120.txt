review/text: If your demand is similar to mine, I think this is a good choice.I do not yoga every day, perhaps once a week. But I guess the mat will be fine if you use it every day.At the beginning it has a wird smell, I know it's some chemical smell, not good for human body. But after I put it outside for several days, it's fine now.
