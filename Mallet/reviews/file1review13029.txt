review/text: Initially when I opened the pkg I thought whoa, this is pretty darn heavy and I was afraid it would hurt more than help but I don't notice the weight of it when I have it on. It feels great when cool. I have not heated it as it feels warm to me as is and sometimes I just wear it room temp to provide support and comfort.
