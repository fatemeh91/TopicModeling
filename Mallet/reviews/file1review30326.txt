review/text: I have been learning to groom my dog, and rapidly grew tired of dragging my full sized vacuum back and forth to clean up all the hair afterwards. I decided I wanted a good, small hand vacuum to just keep in the back room. I wanted it to be powerful, corded (never met a decent rechargeable vacuum yet), and I wanted it to be very easy to empty. This little vacuum cleaner has everything I wanted! And I have to say, I cannot BELIEVE how powerful this thing is. If it were any stronger, I'd have to hold onto it with both hands! It rocks!
