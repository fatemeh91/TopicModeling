review/text: I have to admit...it took me the longest time to be able to try this product. I rarely get sick and, when I did, I completely forgot about taking it! However, when I finally did, I had a respiratory virus. It seems like you have lingering effects with any sort of respiratory illness for weeks. But when I took this, I feel like I recovered much more quickly. Its definitely worth a try if you remember to take it as soon as you feel the symptoms coming on.
