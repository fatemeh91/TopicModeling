review/text: I used to write reviews but now I can't be bothered unless it's to warn people. like now. this is the most disgusting "natural" line out there, which is saying a lot because they are countless. I use truly natural products, so I knew I wasn't going to use this, bought it only for the container for my real product. I just needed a big, cheap container for it. funnily enough the thing stunk so harshly from chemicals, even the stupid container was worthless. I bought both this and the handsoap for containing purposes only but threw both in the bin. throwing money in the bin is so fun. this one just smelled like the regular toxic pinesol in the grocery store- so if that's what you want in a natural product, then this one won't bother you. however, even people who don't mind mainstream products would hate the handsoap- was UNBELIEVABLE- literally smelled like america's seniors' homes -if you don't believe me, buy it. EVERYTHING not to be put in natural products was in these products: alcohol, artificial fragrance, sodium laurel sulfates- to name a few. ick. what do you expect from belgium or denmark or wherever it was made.
