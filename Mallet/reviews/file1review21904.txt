review/text: I eat a Clif Bar everyday before I go to work. And I work the night shift, and I'm constantly on the move, so I need some quick energy. Clif Bars deliver what they promise. As a meal replacement, they work great. I don't feel hungry for hours, and I've got the energy I need to keep going.
