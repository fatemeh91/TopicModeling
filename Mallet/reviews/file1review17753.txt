review/text: I like to keep a bit of stubble going and was in the market for a new trimmer. My previous one, a Wahl, had me juggling many interchangeable heads and using oil to keep the blades sharp. This Remington tackles both of those issues in elegant fashion: a self-sharpening blade and a blade that I &#34;dial up&#34; to the correct length.Highly recommended.
