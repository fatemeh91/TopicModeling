review/text: I bought this in september, maybe used twice a week since.Now recently even after a full charge i'm lucky to barely get 5 minutes of use out of it before it dies. I'm done using remington products have had maybe 3 or 4 shavers die on me, now this. Seems like a quality trimmer, but if it cant keep a full charge its useless to me.
