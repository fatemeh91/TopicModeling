review/text: As I have degenerative arthritis in my neck, this collar helps to support my neck. I can walk around or fall asleep while wearing it and not be concerned about electrical wires. The only thing against using it is it does not stay warm long enough.Arrived quickly as promised. I would purchase it again.
