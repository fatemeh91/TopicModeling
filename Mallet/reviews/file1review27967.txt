review/text: So I went from cardio to weight lifting because i got bored on the treadmilll and stairmaster. So i started doing heavy compound movements. And i thought this would help with recovery, but it really failed in that regard maybe i push my body far above 1 day recovery but i thought it would be better. But half ways through the bottle i started stacking it with creatine after my workouts oh man next day after heavy squats and deadlifts i feel great. Little soreness.
