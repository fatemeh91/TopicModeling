review/text: I received the 450mg tablets which is extra strength instead of 300mg. I did some research online to find the 300mg tablets and it seems no one else has them so I assume they don't sell them in that dose. I tried taking half, but the pill itself it hard to swallow and tastes absolutely awful. Not happy with this purchase and will need to buy a different brand.
