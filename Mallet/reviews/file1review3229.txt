review/text: Not as good as my brother's tweezerman tweezers. I dont know why though. They are definitely better than all the other tweezers I had like revlon or generic, but they could be better like my brother's. He has the colored ones also slant but not the mini slant. Spend a few dollars more for the bigger ones.
