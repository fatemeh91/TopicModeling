review/text: I love this product, I already have an epliator but I wanted something that was faster. I am very satisfied with this product, since its so fast and has two times the coils, it gets the job done much quicker than my old epilator. It takes me about one hour to do my full legs with my old epilator, but with this one it take half the time.The reason I did not give it 5 stars is cuz, the device is a little hard to hold and my hand gets tired and cramped sometimes. Also, the cord is in a weird spot and so it accidentally comes out sometimes. Another problem that others mind find is that its a little too big for small areas like the bikini area, but this was not an issue for me cuz I have a separate epilator for more smaller areas.Overall, I would highly recommend the machine, I love it so much, its made my life so so so much easier.
