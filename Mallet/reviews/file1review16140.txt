review/text: its very cute in a fun sort of a way. it holds exactly 5 applicator tampons perfectly. there is a tampon chart so you can track your period, and apparently vinnies birthday is nov. 8. so cute. the outside is very stiff so the tampons wont get messed up. the quality is good as well. on the zipper it says, i brake cycles.
