review/text: We like this seat over the others we bought previously. There's a rubber seal around it so it stays put. The others we had tended to move around and scare her. It's easy for her to pick up and put on the toilet seat herself. The great plus is that it fits all different kinds of toilets. It's a bit bulky for travelling but not too bad.
