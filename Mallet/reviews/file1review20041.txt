review/text: Ok, so I'm not a kid, but I love strawberries, so I decided to buy this toothpaste. The taste isn't so great (it's like the stuff they use at the dentist), but kids will probably like the light pink color instead of the usual white color found in most toothpastes. And I do have to applaud Tom's of Maine for producing a fluoride-free toothpaste without testing on animals (or including them) since a lot of other toothpaste companies out there do that.Ingredient notes: In this toothpaste, calcium carbonate is derived from chalk, carrageenan from seaweed, sodium lauryl sulfate from coconut oil, and the fruit extracts come from strawberries, bananas, and other natural flavors.
