review/text: I bought this pedifix fungasoap cleansing wash because I had a rash on my stomach, don't know what it is but using this soap (twice so far) it has helped. It hasn't gone away completely but the itching is much less. It has however, helped the bottom of my feet. This is a very nice unexpected surprise. I rub the soap all around my feet and boy, after the first time my extrememly dry, irratable feet became smooth. I got a cut about a year ago on the bottom of my right foot that never really healed and I couldn't put pressure on that foot. Now, after using this soap twice my feet are soft as a baby and my cut doesn't hurt anymore. I can even put pressure on my right foot now. My feet even look like I've had a pedicure. Now, if only my rash would go away!Also, my husband has rosacea (sp?)and his back is extrememly dry also. This has helped him a lot. He doesn't often admit to liking many things (whatever) but he loves this soap! We both love the cool, tingly feeling the soap leaves and it does help heal. I will definitely be keeping this in stock.
