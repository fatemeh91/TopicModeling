review/text: they do the trick. i cant believe razor blades in general are so expensive but this package is not a bad deal. i use each blade about 15 times before i replace them although they do dull out after about 8. but i am a very frugal and poor person so i cannot afford to replace them like a prince. overall though a good value.
