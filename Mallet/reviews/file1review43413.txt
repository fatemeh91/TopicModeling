review/text: I was so excited to find this product due to much pressure and discomfort in my third pregnancy. However, I ended up needing to return it. It fit everywhere quite well and had many adjustable straps, except the one strap that goes under your belly. This felt too tight to me and was uncomfortable. I definitely couldn't sit down with it on and even when standing it left a visible impression under my baby belly.This may be because I carry very low and have a little extra belly fat, but still if they had only made it adjustable I would have loved to keep this product. Unfortunately now I am still unable to find something that works. My only suggestion would be, if you are a slightly bigger girl, try ordering one size larger than you think. I purposely did not because other reviews suggested to order your exact size. Anyhow, it was worth a try. Now if I can just find something else. This product would likely still work for your average or small sized woman.
