review/text: Im not sure how well these work for someone not regular but really shouldnt be used by someone who is. They make you feel great but after about the second bottle my cycle didnt come for a few months. My cycle was like clock work same day every month. When I stopped taking them it took about 6 or 7 months for it to get back on track.
