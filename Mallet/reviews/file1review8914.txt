review/text: I've been taking green vibrance for a little over 60 days now consistently and I can tell you I see benefits. I am 25 and work out periodically. My wife particularly likes to mix it with coconut milk or almond milk, both are great. I man up and mix mine with water. Purified water. This stuff definitely gives you energy and not energy like what caffeine does. It helps your skin and hair, your joints and it also makes you feel good inside. Regardless or not if its "psychological" it's still a good feeling - especially internally. I like to take it in the morning after I work out. All and All, I continue to see myself using this product as long as its developed. I even got my friend taking it including his whole family who are some seriously skeptical southerners. Lowered by friends' dad's blood pressure almost 20% which has always been an issue for him. Definitely recommended - at least try it 30 days and you'll see why.
