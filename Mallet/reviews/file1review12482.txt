review/text: I have had problems with my digestion for years. I was a Renew Life user for a while and went on the internet to see what else was available. I tried this and the way it works on me is mostly erruptive! But it does seem to work. Not sure this is such a healthy way to expel what is building up in the intestine but it feels better than the alternative.
