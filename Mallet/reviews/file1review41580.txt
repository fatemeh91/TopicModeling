review/text: I really wasn't sure about getting this in the beginning... why spend so much when you can just get a manual toothbrush for a buck?Perks:- Travel case- Quick to re-Charge- Gentle brushes- Brushing modesUsing just regular Colgate anti-cavity tooth paste, my teeth have become -noticeably- whiter than before when I used a manual toothbrush... I didn't expect it to work so well!
