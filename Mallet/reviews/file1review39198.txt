review/text: It was time to replace an old cordless all-in-one Panasonic, and after a nightmare experience with a cordless Andis (see separate review) we decided to go for a simple, robust, no frills corded model. We followed the reviews and ordered the Wahl 79524, and we're quite pleased.Pros:* Strong engine, sharp blades, smooth operation. It cuts without effort through the thickest of hair (mine), and glides through thinner hair like butter. It is fairly easy to get a nice, even haircut within minutes.* Comprehensive set of combs, brushes, and even lubricating oil and scissors, all packed in a convenient firm box.* Fairly long cable.* Relatively quiet (compared to the Andis); blades remain cool throughout haircut.Cons:* Most significant one: the "naked" blade is useless at trimming edges (neck, beard line, etc). I fall back to the gentle Panasonic trimmer to do that job.* It is on the heavier side, but still reasonably convenient to hold.* Strong vibrations, takes a good grip to keep it going straight.* Power button not the most convenient I've seen... at least it takes some time to get used to.* It is, well... corded ;-)Bottom line: after 5-6 haircuts, I believe this is a well-built, solid and simple clipper for the low-budget consumer. Good choice for us anyways!UPDATE 7/2010: nearly 3 years later, the clipper is still going strong. It survived a few drops, one actually bended a metal piece but I managed to bend it back, and it actually works fine since then! Be sure to clean it and oil it after every use, and it'll last long enough to justify its modest cost. Great product.
