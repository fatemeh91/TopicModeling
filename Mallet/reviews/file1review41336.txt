review/text: The numbing agent works, yes; my partner lost all feeling for about an hour. To quote him, "I could probably hack it off right now and not feel it." Obviously, that reduced action to nothing until he regained feeling. The product works well enough to the point where you no longer need a condom; if you end up with a pack, think about giving it as a gag gift to that macho jock guy at your high school reunion.
