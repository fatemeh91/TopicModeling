review/text: I bought this as a gift for a friend who is a doctor knowing absolutely NOTHING about stethoscopes. It was really just a jokey present. The colour is fantastic and the quality seems pretty good for what you pay for it. This is not a high end stethoscope, but it really did work. It was just what I wanted and at a reasonable price.
