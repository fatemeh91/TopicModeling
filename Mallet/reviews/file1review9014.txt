review/text: First off, I'm a person who's very much into health products. Through-out the course of my lifetime, I've juiced (fresh vegetables, fresh fruits) with a juicer. I've drank liqufied: broccolli,lettuce,celery,parsley,kale,spinach. Yes, it was a disgusting taste at first, but after two or three tries it's an acquired taste. The only reason I stopped juicing was because of the bacteria on vegetables. Plus, honestly it's a lot of work to purchase tons of vegetables, clean and store them, clean the juicer afterwards and so on...on a daily basis.Which leads me to my point about Green Vibrance. Yes, the taste is bad but with patience to find the right combination to mix or drink with it, you will never regret it. Nor will the taste bother you either. I've had such great health benfits: tighter, healthier looking skin, way more energy, calmness,and I can't remember the last time I had a cold, regardless of being around those who do. It's a great health benefit. Expensive, but worth every penny. Considering if you got sick,and had to buy cold medicine or worse go to a doctor, you would pay way more than you would by using this product. I can't live without it!
