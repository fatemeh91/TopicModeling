review/text: I held off on writing this review until I'd been using the silk epil for a few months.At first I wasn't very happy with it. It seemed to break quite a few hairs instead of getting them out at the root, leaving my legs feeling rough. After using it patiently for quite a while, and after reading some tips from other reviewers here, I got the hang of it, and I'm happy to report that my legs are now as smooth as they ever were after shaving.It's really important to go slow, and to hold the silk epil at a 90 degree angle. Also, if you have sensitive skin, as I do, you'll have some icky bumps after epilating--try to do it right before bed so your legs can recover overnight.My most important discovery was that the silk epil works MUCH more efficiently without either of the snap-on guards, and really isn't much more painful. I've never had it pinch my skin at all. You'd have to really jam it into some loose skin, I imagine, for it to pinch you.As far as pain goes, it really wasn't bad. The first time, when you have tons of hair on your legs, is always the worst, but if you do regular touch-ups, you'll hardly feel a thing.I only use the silk epil on my legs; I tried it on my underarms, but the pain was really bad, and it left a terrible rash (I have the world's most sensitive skin; it may work for other people). And I refuse to even think about using it anywhere else. Yikes.To sum up, the silk epil has a high learning curve and it takes a bit of patience and experimentation to get the results you want, but it's definitely worth it once you do.
