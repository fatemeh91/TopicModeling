review/text: My mother has macular degeneration and I had hoped this watch would provide a way for her to hear the time and the date. Unfortunately, the volume on the announcement is not loud enough and the computerized voice is too choppy and strangely intonated to hear clearly. She can't even wear it as a watch because there isn't enough contrast on the display for her to see.The idea is great and the watch seems to be made well, it just does not deliver on what it was designed to do - talk in an understandable and audible way for those who are visually impaired.
