review/text: I've had my Braun shaver for about 3 years now. Each year I always buy the replacement foil/cutter parts.Recently I purchased the foil/cutter parts. I'm actually shocked that after only a few weeks and not shaving everyday, that the foil part is already broken. In other words, a piece of the metal on the foil is sticking up making it impossible to shave with.
