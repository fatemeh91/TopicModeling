review/text: I've been using these flavored toothpicks since I quit smoking three months ago. They have an excellent (and strong) flavor and work well to freshen breath and fight the oral fixation left over from smoking. Everyone who bums one off of me always wants to know where I purchased them. I'm a fan of the tea tree flavor, although this company also makes a cinnamon variety. The cinnamon sticks are very hot and may bother some. Have tried other flavored toothpicks and nothing stacks up to these.
