review/text: I guess you get what you pay for. It fits a gallon jug, and it usually pumps (usually), but the pumping mechanism is separate from the fixed part... as in it is free-floating, and it can fall out. The liquid in the container can spill out. Overall, this is not a "good" product, only a "functional" one... and even that rating is marginal. If I were to buy another pump (and I will have to soon, I'm sure), I would not even consider these. I do not recommend that anyone waste their money on these pumps.
