review/text: I bought this thermometer and used it s few times when the battery died. I went out and bought a new battery and the darned thing won't work at all now. 3 or 4 uses for $15.00 ??? What a waste of money! I bought an off brand from a local drug store for $3.95 that seems to do the same thing and still works after countless uses.
