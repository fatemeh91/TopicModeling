review/text: Definitely lathers well. Feels great on skin. This shaving cream is unscented. That is how I wanted my cream but if you are a person who likes strong scents, this cream may not be for you. So far this is the best shaving cream I have used. I have very sensitive skin and this cream works out fine for me.
