review/text: I began taking FertilAid on the first day of my cycle because I was afraid it may work against me if I started it in the middle. I have been taking it for almost a month now, and I haven't had any side effects yet. I take one 3x a day, and I make sure to eat a little beforehand. I am 2DPO right now, and I could see a difference in my CM during. Another thing is that since I have started taking it, I have been in the mood constantly! We are not pregnant just yet, but this is my first cycle. I have faith that it will work!
