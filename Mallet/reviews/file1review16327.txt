review/text: I really believe that Finish makes the best dishwasher detergent on the market. It always does the best job removing stuck and burned on gross stuff from my pots and pans, and it cleans the rest of the dishes really well too. The only bad thing I could possibly say is that Finish has never had the array of pretty scents that other dishwasher detergent do. There's no lavender, or dragonfruit, or lemon, or green apple. There's always just been regular, which is a bit bleach-like and a bit fresh. But now, I see, Finish has scented detergent. Yay! I just love things that smell nice, and this detergent has a really nice, light orange scent. Each tablet comes individually wrapped, and they perform all of the Finish magic to which I am accustomed in the dishwasher. Absolutely no complaints from me.TL; DR: Cleans great, smells great.
