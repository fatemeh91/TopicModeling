review/text: I have been wearing support hose for years. I am on my feet all day and these are the best I have found. They are tight, but the strong band at the top makes putting them on very easy. When I take them off, there is no swelling of my ankles. These support hose makes my legs feel great. I have tried many other brands, these hold up great.
