review/text: If you read the description closely of the Gillette Fusion product as put out by Gillette, you will see that Gillette doesn't actually claim that you get a closer or even better shave. They very cleverly use terms like "a better way to shave" or "30% closer blades", and there is a reason for this. The reality is that very little (if any) improvement in the actual shave itself has been made since the 3-blade systems. And Gillette knows this through their own internal research. Their studies show that customers can't discern the difference between 3-blade and Fusion systems. It is all just perception. However, Gillette with these newer hyped blade systems is able to charge a lot more for the replacement blades and reap higher profit margins than the older blade systems. The reason I know is that I have a cousin high up in one of these companies.Here is another interesting tidbit you probably didn't know about all of this. Have you ever wondered why the original blade that came on the actual razor you purchased seemed to last much longer than any of the replacements. Well there is a reason for this too. The blades that go with the razor packages actually come from a different stock, which are made much sharper to give a better shave and last much longer. Gillette doesn't want folks to get a bad first impression. As you probably know, they don't make money on the razors. The real money is with the replacement blades. And the blade stock used on the replacement blades is inferior and much duller to get folks to replace them faster.With the significant price difference between the older 3-blade systems and newer ones like Fusion, folks really are better off saving their money and sticking with the older systems.
