review/text: I have combination skin and usually have no problem with peels or enzyme masks of any kind. However, this broke me out terribly after using it. I tried it several times to see if my skin was just "purging" but my skin always had the same reaction. I am really sad because I had high hopes for this product line because it seemed to have great reviews, but I am continually unimpressed each time I try something by them. Perhaps it is because they have changed their formulas and are using cheaper ingredients? I'm not sure. All I know is this one does not work for me.
