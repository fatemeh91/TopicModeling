review/text: For guys that have curly facial hair, this is a must because of the ingrown hairs that eventually occur. I will often get these on my neck and this product has been perfect for quickly and easily removing those. The tweezers are wide and secure in my hand which allow more control in the process. Before buying these I would sometimes have to use a straight pin along with regular tweezers to access the ingrown hair. The tips of this product are so fine that I no longer need to jab at my neck with a pin. Also if I catch a hair that has just begun to grow back under my skin, these will easily lift those out before it becomes a problem. However, if you are bleeding, make sure you stop that first because I have found these tend to lose grip when the hair and or tweezers are a little slick from blood. Don't they all?The interior portion does not have any ridges but has been machined in such a way that it provides excellent grip when the hair is dry. Since the tips are so fine it can sometimes be hard to grasp those properly but when you do, one pull is all that's needed. For splinters, these are a must! Even with a little bleeding these have done the job very quickly and without causing anymore damage to the surrounding skin.I would warn you that if your hands shake these are probably not the best tweezers to purchase. Since they are so precise, you have to be as well. The tips on these things are needle-like. You need a steady hand and good hand/eye coordination and for obvious reasons, don't use these anywhere around your eyes. For me, they have proven invaluable but I realize these tweezers might not be the best choice for everyone. If these don't work great for you, it will very likely be the operator, not the product. I don't even attempt to tweeze hairs if I have the coffee jitters.
