review/text: I started taking CoQ10 a couple weeks ago after reading about benefits in a brain health book. I noticed a change the first few days but seems like my body has adjusted since then. I will still take them but plan to try the Trader Joe's brand which is being sold for 17.99 (100mg and 90 tabs).
