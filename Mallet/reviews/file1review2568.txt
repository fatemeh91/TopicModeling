review/text: The razor works just fine, as expected. The problem I had was with the seller. I was asked to rate my experience with the seller (not a product review). I gave them one star only, because I felt the $11.95 USPS shipping charge for a product weighing about one pound was excessive. It was like I kicked a hornet's nest. I received two telephone calls from the seller demanding I retract my poor review. They also sent me two e-mails instructing me how to make the retraction.This part may be hard to believe: the second caller, who identified herself as the Customer Service Supervisor told me they fake the shipping weight as 4 pounds in the Amazon listing, raise the S&H; fee and reduce the razor an equivelent amount so the razor will be competitively priced. HUH?I hope this is not a widespread practice. I am a frequent Amazon customer and I just want to place my orders without thinking about what games people might be playing.
