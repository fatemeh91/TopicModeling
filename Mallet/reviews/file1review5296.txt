review/text: I bought these for my wife after she was diagnosed with Gastroparesis, after eating various feeds GP causes her to feel mildly nauseated, after eating she pops one of these in her mouth and they actually work well with settling her stomach - she also takes then on trips when driving now and found they help with motion sickness as well.
