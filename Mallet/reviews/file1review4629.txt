review/text: I thought I would try a new razor and saw the fushion. I am totally disappointed and actually threw out the razor and refills before I used them all. I have never cut my face so much with a razor and by five shaves the blade was done. This is the worst system gillette has ever released - my mach three is far superior. I tried the Schick hydo 5 and it is a pleasure and leaps and bounds better.
