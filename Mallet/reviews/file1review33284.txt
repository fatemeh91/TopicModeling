review/text: I bought this product after seeing my cousin use hers ALL THE TIME. One day she threw it over my shoulders and I just felt my tension and stress melt away. You can warm it up to be as warm or as hot as you'd like. The smell is different, but theraputic.An extra tip: heat it up right before you go to bed and throw it under the covers. Wash your face, brush your teeth, whatever your ritual is...climb into bed and VOILA its nice and warm. No more crawling in to a cold bed on a winter night!
