review/text: I got this breathalyzer because of a inability to judge when I was "legally" drunk. After some informal testing, it seems to work as advertised. It's small and easy to carry. Plus, after using it a while, I'm better able to judge my level of intoxication even when I don't have it.Also very handy at parties when an inebriated guest is insistent on leaving. If they pass the test they can have their keys!
