review/text: Why do you wear negligees? Because for men the eyes are quickest path to the libido! Well, besides negligees, a nice visual cue is a tattoo. But, permanent tattoos cannot be changed; they're one-note sambas. :-(Well, with this temporary tattoo you can surprise him anytime. Probably the best place to put it is on your stomach, below your navel, but anywhere will do. Combine it with some jewelry, and a set of nipple clamps, and you are guaranteed of having his undivided attention. The possibilities are only limited by you imagination!Yep, this is a great addition to your bedroom repertoire. Use them with imagination, and have some fun! I highly recommend this tattoo!(Review of DRAGON 4 Temporary Tattoo 2.5x3.5)
