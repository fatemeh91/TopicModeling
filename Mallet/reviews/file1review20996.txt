review/text: I am a massage therapist and I find the Jeanie Rub to be a deep and powerful tool for working out stubborn and chronically tight areas on my body. It's more effective when used by someone else upon you, but it is very easy to operate and so nearly anyone could use it. The included foot massage accessory makes it easy to use as a foot massager too! Great value, especially for a professional grade massager that I'd be proud to use on my clients.
