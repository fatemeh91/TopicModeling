review/text: The Wahl clipper kit does a nice job of giving a haicut and has the feel of a professional clipper. The attachments are adequate for the job. The only small downer is the cheap plastic drape to keep the hair off of you. Other than that, it is a well built product and should last a while.I would recommend it if asked.
