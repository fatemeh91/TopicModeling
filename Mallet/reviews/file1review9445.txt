review/text: If you have problem skin, there is nothing you can buy that will exceed this mask. I was having my makeup done at a Chanel counter and was asked what I did to keep to keep my skin so clear. When I told her, sort of embarrassedly, that I used this mask, she smiled knowingly and said "I tell all my clients to use it." This, coming from someone who works for one of the more-sophisticated skin care brands out there.You put it on, and within minutes it has literally vacuumed your pores. I don't know what is in this stuff and frankly, I don't care. I'm 26 and I'm still dealing with acne--this is the only product that knocks out a breakout with no fuss. I'm in med school so I have zero time to fret about the status of my skin. I slap this on, study, take a break to take it off and voila. Invisible pores, shrunken zits, the works. If I could give it 50 stars I would. And, can it get any cheaper than this for a skin care product that WORKS? Probably not.
