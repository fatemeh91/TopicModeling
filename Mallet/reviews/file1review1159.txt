review/text: When I am feeling lazy I love that these are quicker and easier than flossing. If you're careful they do the trick every time (but don't tell your dentist - he'll say they hurt your gums ...sure- if you use them like a pick axe...). Only problem: I can't find them anywhere - likely they are too good a value. You get a lot of them for a small price - so I'm guessing that's why my Walgreen's stopped carrying them in favor of fewer for more. I tried to order them online through amazon but it was about $20 to ship a $2.99 product...
