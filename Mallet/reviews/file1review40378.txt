review/text: My wife had a pretty bad cold that laid her out for and entire weekend and that persisted for a week. Monday morning I started getting that feeling that I was getting it. You know the one you hope you are wrong about!!!By Monday night I knew the funny feeling was real and that I was catching the cold. I started popping these as prescribed. The directions are take 2 capsules with a small amount of water 5 times daily for 2 days.By Wednesday I need to take some cold medicine. I never really got knocked down though and only took cold medicine through Thursday's night.I really believe taking these at the onset help to drastically minimize the effects of the cold and kept the symptoms to a minimum.I highly recommend keeping a bottle of these one hand so you can start taking them as soon as you start felling the cold come on.
