review/text: We only had 5 or so burp cloths, a thick flannel kind, and when I was looking for more to buy I found these by reading other people's reviews. At first I was hesitant because of how much thinner they are than the other kind I had, but now I use these almost exclusively.They are lightweight, but especially folded in half they work great as a burp cloth.My daughter's tear ducts did not open fully for several months, so she constantly had gunk coming out of her eyes. A corner of these thin cloths was a great way to gently wipe her eye area clean.She also uses these (at 8 months old) as her blankie, I keep trying to introduce others but she "needs" one of these cloths to snuggle to sleep. Works great for us since we have 2 dozen so there is always one at hand and clean! They are also lightweight so less of a smother hazard than a thicker blankie.I highly recommend these, they are versatile and even though they are thin they have held up well for us through many many washes.I DO NOT recommend them as cloth diapers - we haven't used them for this purpose, and they are so much thinner than other cloth diapers that I imagine you would have to use several.
