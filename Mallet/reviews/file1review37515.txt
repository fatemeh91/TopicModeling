review/text: I agree that the chair is very comfortable for people smaller than average people, and does give the feeling of being weightless. However, the chair I owned had defective welds, which caused the frame to break within a month of purchase. I was fortunate enough to purchase my chair at a place where I could inspect the remaining stock, and several of the chairs they were selling also had defective welds. I would not purchase this chair unless it was from a place that allowed me to carefully inspect the item before buying. One other caveat: the vinyl cover slips on like a fitted sheet. Inspect it carefuly to make sure that the seams are correctly sewn and that the cover will fit well. For the price, it's a decent chair, but for me, there are just too many quality issues to recommend it to anyone.
