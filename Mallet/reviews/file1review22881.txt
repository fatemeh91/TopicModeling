review/text: I love it because it is easy and quick. My daughter asked how to plug it in. It's funny because we assume you need suction to pick up dirt and debris. The only problem I have is that the metal handle comes apart from time to time. It's weird that they didn't make a little hole and pop out button or something to keep it together. I am going to try to just glue the pieces. I have two toddlers, so there are always cheerios and messes everywhere and it's nice not to worry about plugging it in.
