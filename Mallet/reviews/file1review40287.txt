review/text: Pros: soft cotton with thin foam or neoprene pads at wrist, lengthly strapsCons: possibly shortened lifespan with cotton rather than other strap materialI think with other strap material, the lifespan could be greater. However, at about $5, I would rather go with cotton and be more comfortable and replace them every few years. I generally use these to supplement my lifting for deadlifts to be able to do more reps without tiring the forearms. I don't know if they are strong enough for guys who might be letting these straps hold hundreds of pounds.
