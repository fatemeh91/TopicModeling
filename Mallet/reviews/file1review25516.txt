review/text: Many of the reviews here 2 years and older refer to an earlier verison of this model.Panasonic is now using a less powerful motor and apparently changed the blade design as well. I used to think this was a superior trimmer. Now, it is on par with all the others.I purchased this product about 2 years ago based on all the positive reviews, and I loved it. I will admit it that the only drwaback was that it would very slightly pull hairs if they were too long, but that could be avoided with routine use.My kids recently broke mine. Without hesitation, I reordered from Amazon. I was shocked to discover this newer version has a less powerful motor. I knew the second I turned it that the motor was different. It sounded like my old one with nearly dead batteries!It took longer to trim hairs and did not even do a thorough job.What a disappointment!
