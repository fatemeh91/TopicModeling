review/text: This oil has made my hair shiny and healthy immediately with the first use. I have been using it for about a week, and my hair has stayed healthy and shiny. It takes away all kinks due to its moisturizing properties. I love this product, and in my personal opinion this is the best oil for my hair. I have tried Vatika and other Ayurveda oils. I have also tried Moroccan oil and Argan oil. This product provided the results I was trying to achieve with those other products. I will keep using it, and firmly believe that it provides the right environment for my hair to thrive in and will promote growth. My hair grows really slow naturally, but with this oil, I just know it will grow out much quicker.
