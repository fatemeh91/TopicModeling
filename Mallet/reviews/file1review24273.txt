review/text: I run and walk everyday for exercise aside from my daily activity. I thought pains in my knees, lower back, and calf muscle was because I always overworked my lower body.I found out that I have hyperextended ligaments on bottom of my feet.Although I'm not a traditional flat feet but affects me when I walk or stand; my foot arch does not stay arched.I decided to give this product a try after reading reviews of other comsumers.When I received it there was an instruction informing what needs to happen.Fortunately, I felt the comfort the very first day without going through adjustment as the instruction said.I no longer have knee pain, hip pain, and back pain.My overextending arches, of course, feel like they are being constantly deep-massaged.I gues this is the part where other users say it requires getting used-to.I did not know how walking could be so easy.I even put them in my in-home slippers because Walkfit works for me.I love the part where I can change the height of the insole from low to high.I can tolerate them with my barefoot but I love them more when I wear them with socks on.
