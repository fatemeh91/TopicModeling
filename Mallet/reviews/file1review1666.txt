review/text: When I first heard of this product I said to myself, "How cool, it's MAGIC." As a long-time believer in both the powers of fruit (especially the tropical varieties) and magic (only "white" though!), I thought that this lotion would be the answer to all my foot-related prayers. Well, take it from me, although this product IS a lotion for feet, it is in no way magical (I tested it with a crystal AND my divining rod, so I know what I'm talking about). So, if you want just a plain old mango foot lotion, go ahead and buy this product, but don't expect any magic!
