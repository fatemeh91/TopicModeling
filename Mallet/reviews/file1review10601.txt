review/text: I bought this mirror to take along on a trip. I had gotten spoiled having a lighted magnifying mirror to apply make up at home. I always found hotel mirrors to be poorly lit and difficult to get close to without awkwardly leaning over the counter. I took a chance that this product might be a solution. It met and surpassed all my expectations. The suction cup attached easily and securely to the hotel mirror. I attached it when I arrived and it stayed there for a week without slipping or falling off. The arm extends out an amazing distance and can be pivoted easily at both ends to adjust the positioning of the magnifying mirror wherever you need it - a shorter length for applying makeup, or extended the full length which let's you see what you're doing when styling the back of your hair. I am so glad I took a chance on this mirror. It was well worth the price and I highly recommend it.
