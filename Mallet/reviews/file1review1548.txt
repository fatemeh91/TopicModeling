review/text: I had a stubborn wart on my finger, and I tried everything to make it go away. I tried Compound W Wart Remover bandages, and though I thought my wart was completely removed, it returned a few weeks later. I found this product upon searching for wart remover, and I was desperate, so I just went ahead and tried it.Because it is a stick solid, it is easy to apply exactly where it is needed, instead of using a bandage with a pre-applied remover compound. It took only a few weeks for my wart to be completely deadened, and now you can't even tell that I used to have a terrible wart on my thumb. This product is great!!!!
