review/text: Ironically I received this shipment on the day I came down with a really bad stomach virus so it was a little late for me.I did, however give it to my husband who took it the entire week I was sick. He did get the virus but only for 1 day as opposed to my 7.Unfortunately he quit taking the pills while he was working with an ill co-worker, and he did catch that.I don't know what to say. I feel it did help him stave off the stomach virus and it could have helped him from getting the cold he got from the co-worker had he continued to take it.That being said, I have taken echinacea before with success.Thank you.MEF
