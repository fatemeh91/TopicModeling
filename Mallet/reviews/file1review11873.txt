review/text: There were some mistakes made on my first order of this product both by me and by Amazon,, two cal but after spending some quality time with the service department all was resolved to my satisfaction. I needed this product as I am recovering from neck cancer and need to feed through a tube into my stomach, so I have no idea what it tastes like, but if you find yourself in a position of having to put on some weight this will do the trick. Other popular products like Ensure plus have 350 calories per can . this stuff has 475. Most folks are looking for things to bring their weight down and finding something that does the opposite isn't easy. This is the stuff.
