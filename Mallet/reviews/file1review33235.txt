review/text: These booties are awesome! I have Fibromyalgia, arthritis and a very painful, degenerative autoimmune disease, so I am always looking for things that make me feel better and ease my pain. These sure do the trick! Not only do these keep your feet warm and ease away any aches and pains in your feet, but somehow having that heat directly on the bottom of your feet eases pain in other areas of your body and just totally relaxes you. My theory is that because there are pressure points in your feet that correspond with every area of your body, that the heat somehow eases pain in those parts too. Maybe it is the herbal blend that is in the booties. All I know for sure is that they work!! I highly recommend them to anyone who gets cold feet during the winter, anyone who has tired, achy feet and definitely anyone who has any type of pain condition. The price is very reasonable so you can't really go wrong! I do want to mention that these booties are meant to be used sitting down. YOU CANNOT WALK IN THEM! So if you are looking for slippers, these are not for you.
