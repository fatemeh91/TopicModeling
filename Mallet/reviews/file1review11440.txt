review/text: Great idea, but the two I ordered for my wife were not usable because the holes in the bracket to attach the arms were in the wrong place. You could not secure the arms in place at a 90 degree angle and leaving them unsecured would have been unstable for user. I had to send both back for a refund. Really disappointed!
