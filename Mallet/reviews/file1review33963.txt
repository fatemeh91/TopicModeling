review/text: I bought this product because I love Lush and my boyfriend loves massages. Based both on the description and other reviews I bought the Therapy bar.Initially, I was completely turned off by the scent of the freshly unwrapped bar. It smelled gross and I was so disappointed. The boyfriend was not going to be denied, so I used it anyway. That's where the story improves.Tactilely, this massage bar is amazing. It is moisturizing without being greasy or oily, and it feels wonderful on the the skin. Not only did the boyfriend rave about how good it felt, it made my hands feel great. The next surprising plus was that once the bar heated up and I just rubbed it into his skin, the horrible scent actually turned very pleasant, light and floral. It really surprised me, because the bar itself smelled nothing like that.I will probably order other massage bars in search of the right scent, because it honestly did work excellently as a massage oil/lotion/butter.Pro: Very moisturizing and left skin feeling smooth, velvety, and relaxed.Con: The initial scent was gross. I can't give it a negative, though, because once it warmed up it actually smelled good.
