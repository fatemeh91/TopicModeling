review/text: My husband has suffered from pain for much of his life. We originally saw Super Bluestuff on an infomercial years ago and decided to try it. It was amazing how quickly and well it worked on his pain. We never go without it now! I was so happy to see it was available from amazon and for a cheaper price than anywhere else. I sent a bottle to my mom last week. She said she's had neck pain every night for years, and after just one application she had her first pain-free night in a long time. I know the price seems a little high, but a bottle lasts for months and isn't living a painless life worth it? I sure think so!Good luck getting rid of your pain.
