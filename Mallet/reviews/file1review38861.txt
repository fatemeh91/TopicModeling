review/text: Was pleasantly surprised by the short time to deliver. Hadn't been expecting it for a couple days yet when the box showed up. I have used this product for quite a while, then began to despair when I could no longer find it on shelves. I think the Skin Bracer Pre-Electric works better and smells better than other similar products I have tried
