review/text: I sleep with this mask on every night for my allergy pressures, but that's only because I haven't had a chance to try a better one. Sometimes it can be so cold that it causes pain around my temples. And coming from me, that says a lot since I get hotflashes and enjoy any cooldown I can get. Oh, and it only stays cold for about 15 -20 minutes. However, I do find that it helps my eyes. I have bad allergies and my eyes get very dry, irritable, and tired. This mask helps me wake up fresh. It's also thick - I could sleep with the light on if I wanted to and it would appear dark to me. Anyways, it's better than nothing, but I was very disappointed.
