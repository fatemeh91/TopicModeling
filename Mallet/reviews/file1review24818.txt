review/text: This the second time herbs have helped me get pregnant. The first time, we tried unsuccessfully for almost two years before taking herbs (my husband and I both took them). That formula we took was similar to this Fertilaid formula. Within two months I was pregnant, and our little girl is now two.This time, after trying for almost a year, we tried Fertilaid for both men and women (the other brand doesn't seem to be distributed anymore). Within the first month of taking them (we didn't even finish our first bottle each), I got pregnant! Boy, was I surprised after seeing so many negatives previously.I am not good at remembering to take pills while I'm out and about, so I always took three at once, instead of the recommended three times a day. What can I say, I guess it still worked!
