review/text: These tablets are big and smelly...they smell like grave dirt, I like to joke. They stink out my whole pill box and make me grimace each time I have one, albeit only for a few seconds. (Doable for me though, unlike actually eating liver!)The tablets are only lightly coated so you can taste the liver-y goodness quite well, sadly.My only problem with the content is that the liver is defatted which seems a weird idea to me as I had thought a large percentage of the nutrients in liver, such as vitamin A, were fat soluble? I'm also not a fan of the added B12 and particularly this inferior form of it.Ron's Ultrapure does the best liver capsules (and non-defatted and non-smelly ones too!) but these ones are at least a lot cheaper. I'm going to take soem of both brands I think as I can't afford to take high amounts of the more expensive one.To read about the benefits of consuming liver in neurological diseases such as MS do a web search for 'Dr Klenner, B vitamins, liver' or similar. There is also great information on the benefits of eating liver if you have liver problems or really any disease at all, on the Weston A Price Foundation website - along with other nutrient dense foods such as bone broths, coconut oil and other (organic) organ meats. Books such asEat Fat, Lose Fat: The Healthy Alternative to Trans FatsandDeep Nutrition: Why Your Genes Need Traditional FoodandPrimal Body, Primal Mind: Beyond the Paleo Diet for Total Health and a Longer Lifeare also good on the subject of liver.Liver is often said to be the number one superfood. Thank goodness it comes in tablet forms I say!Jodi Bassett, The Hummingbirds' Foundation for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis
