review/text: Ironically, finding a natural and healthy protein powder can be difficult to find. At your local grocers, you'll find plenty of protein powder options, but few stay away from fake ingredients like: sucralose, artificial flavors, and artificial colors. You'd think, with a health-conscious community, that protein powder would follow suit. Unfortunately, your options are limited. Iron-Tek makes a very good tasting, high-quality product for athletes. For the first year of use I had the vanilla cake flavor (just by virtue of the first jar I grabbed). Vanilla cake is okay, but when I switched to Chocolate Fudge - phew! Way better flavor and with the same great standards.Dear Iron-tek: Please continue to buck the trend of artificial and fake protein powders - keep making this affordable, awesome product!***UPDATE-8.31.2012***: The featured picture states that there are 77 servings. It is 70. The weights are the same, the serving size (scoop) was enlarged.
