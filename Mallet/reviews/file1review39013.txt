review/text: IT WAS A MISTAKE TO BUY THIS PRODUCT. O.K. I TAKE THE BLAME.I HAVE SEEN SOMETHING SIMILAR IN MARSHALL OR IN ROSS, BUT I DECIDED TO TAKE THIS WAHL 79524 BY THINKING IN THE BRAND AND THE PRESENTATION, BUT I HAVE USED IT JUST FOR THREE OR FOUR TIMES, AND IT HAS LOST THE EDGE. MACHINE not include all the attachments that ANNOUNCED
