review/text: Was looking for something other than chewable vitamins that would disolve fairly quickly. Found the Bluebonnet brand and found them to be fine after having Gastric Sleeve surgery. My doctor had no issues with me taking them since they were not causing any issues. I like the value of the 180 capsule bottle because the 30s I was buying locally had a lot of wasted space within the bottles. I will definitely be buying again.
