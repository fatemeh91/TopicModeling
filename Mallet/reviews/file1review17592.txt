review/text: It's great when it's fully charged but you have no idea when it's going to die on you. The LED simply lets you know that you plugged it in. I LOVE only doing half my beard and the thing dies on me. It wouldn't be that big of a deal if you could use it while plugged in but when they say cordless they mean cordless only. Next time I'm getting one with a battery indicator or one that will work while charging.
