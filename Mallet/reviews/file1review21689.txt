review/text: My child is nearly one year old and enjoys this bath very much. the colors are bright and keeps my child engaged. She never gets bored at aback time. In fact, she attempts to follow me into the bathroom every time I head that way! Its easy to fill, easy to drain, drys well and stores well, for us, behind the door. I only wish it had a temperature gauge attached to it, but i just purchased one separate. I would recommend this product to anyone with a child who is old enough for it.
