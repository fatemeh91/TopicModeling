review/text: After years of having beard and using scissors and a lesser electric razor with only 3 settings, this is the best. The longest setting is over a 1/2 inch, longer than I would want it, and the shortest setting is almost a clean shave, so you have a lot of control over the length. There are a total of 9 lengths. This makes beard trimming very quick and easy. It is still running great after a year.
