review/text: Orignally I bought these to use as burp clothes but my baby does not spit up much at all and it feel funny to carry these around as burp clothes or wiping my baby face so I use it everyday to wipe my baby's bottom, after using the diaper wipes which always leave her bottom so wet, and also on "air out" time. Let just say, she does not have any diaper rash at all! Like other Mom said in their reviews, you can use it for so many purposes. Bleach does wonder to remove soiled diapers (if you don't use disposable diapers).
