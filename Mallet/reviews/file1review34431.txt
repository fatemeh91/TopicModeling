review/text: I use Wet Platinum for cycling on road bikes since the "bike brands" are a bit too expensive. In short touch anything with this stuff and it's lubricated for life! Standard silicon base personal lubricant. You'll need a towel or soap and water to wash it off but otherwise it's great stuff for any kind of sport or activity that has a lot of chaffing.
