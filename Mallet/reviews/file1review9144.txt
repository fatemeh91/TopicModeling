review/text: not sure why but this stuff truely gets to the root of the pain. i have fibro and have tried over 20 topical sprays and creams from amazon alone.. i buy this at my local walgreens and altho it doesnt last as long as i wish it would it really takes away that terrible achey feeling and FAST. i just ordered 6 bottles from another source because they offered a volume discount and since my condition will likely never go away i want to make sure i ALWAYS have this product on hand. so grateful for it, i use it daily- i have one in each room of the house and in the car !!!!
