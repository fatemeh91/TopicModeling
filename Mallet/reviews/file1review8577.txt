review/text: This is my second OXO grout brush and their must have been a change in the provider of the bristles because these are not the same as on my first brush. I use this brush to clean the grout lines in my showers, specifically along the corners and rail for the shower door. I use with a travertine cleaner, and while travertine requires a soft brush, this replacement brush seems to be much more delicate than the one I am used to.The handle is still well designed and I prefer the OXO design to other brushes on the market. It is lightweight and has an ideal arc to the handle which allows you to scrub out the grout lines without rubbing out your knuckles. Now it is a narrow brush and not ideal for scrubbing the entire wall, but as far as being able to get the grout area with minimal effort, this brush is a good choice.Maybe I just got a soft brush that was part of a bad batch and at this price point I cannot really complain. So I would recommend and buy this brush again.
