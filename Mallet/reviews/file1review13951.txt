review/text: I received two, not three trays. I ordered these to use with teeth whitening gel I just got and after I placed the order, the estimated delivery time was about a month from the date I ordered them. I soon realized that it was because they were coming from China. These are trays that you are supposed to boil, put in your mouth and suck on to make them fit. China is famous for making cheap knock-offs and have far less stringent safety regulations. I do not want to put these in my mouth. If I knew they were coming from China I would have never ordered them. I didn't expect this from an Amazon seller.
