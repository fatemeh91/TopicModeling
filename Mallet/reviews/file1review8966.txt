review/text: I wake up with my frozen papaya and my green vibrance in a blender with chia seeds and flax oil and coconut oilBlended all up with any kind of juice I have and it is yummy. Sometimes I add honey. I have just been doing it for over a week and love it. I lost weight and feel great. I will see what happens after a month. I ordered three since my girlfriend Xiomara has been taken it for a while and told me about it. Everyone should be on this since we don't eat right as it is. Just hope they don't bring up the price.
