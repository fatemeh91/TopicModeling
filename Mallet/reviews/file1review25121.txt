review/text: I have no trouble at all getting the job done with this tool. It is extremely important to follow the instructions word for word, as it does not work the way you may think it would without reading them. I have no problem with the tissue staying in place, and no problem with it easily & cleanly sliding off into the toilet when released. I had lower back surgery a week ago, and until 2 days ago my devoted spouse was performing the job for me manually. Believe me, this method has proven highly preferable for both of us.
