review/text: I'm not exactly a baby face but I do have sensitive skin thats blemish free. If you're like me you need a good gel to protect your face and make your razor glide easily. I've always preferred Gillettes Gel to Edge. I think it shaves closer and protects your skin better. Goes on think and shaves very smooth and has aloe to protect your skin even more. A product I cannot live without.
