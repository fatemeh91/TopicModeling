review/text: It is exactly what it's supposed to be. The container seems a bit oversized though. The powder is a lot cheaper than buying the capsules, and if you mix it with ovaltine it works well. A tablespoon or two will make you feel warm and 'pumped', along with generally seeming to help healing time. Some people get migraines/headaches if they step up the dose too quickly, just keep that in mind.
