review/text: This is a great immune system builder, far better than Airborne and similar "mostly vitamin C and ginseng" products available OTC.I take this at the first sign of colds, flu and even cold & canker sores, and it either stops them dead or reduces the duration and severity of symptoms by around 1/3. It even seems to help a little during allergy season.It comes in both capsules and tablets, the tablets being a bit less expensive (2 capsules= 1 tablet for a dose). Note that for some, the tablets may be a bit too large, and the taste is not very good.
