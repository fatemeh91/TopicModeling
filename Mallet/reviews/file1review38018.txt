review/text: I have taught CPR for almost 35 years and currently head up an American Heart Association Training Center. My instructors have had access to the top 4 AED trainers for over 5 years, but every one of them prefers to use the Philips Medical Heartstart. The other trainers gather dust. The Philips line of AEDs began as HeartStream in the late 1990s and were the first on the market with FDA-approved biphasic (2 directional) shocks, first to put AEDs on airplanes (American Airlines), first with FDA-approved Pediatric Pads,the first and currently only AED officially approved by the American Dental Association, and the first to be able to be purchased without a doctor's prescription. And considering that just a few years ago, AEDs cost almost $5000, the price makes it a steal! If you have a loved one in your home with a heart condition, this is the device for you! Be aware that no device guarantees success, and this machine will not help a heart attack, but it is the best chance for someone who experiences a Sudden Cardiac Arrest (complete heart stoppage). But if you buy it, please also take the time to get trained in its use by attending a HeartSaver AED training course - use of an AED is only 1 of 4 links in the AHA "Chain of Survival". You can find a course near you by going on the American Heart Association Webpage and locating a Training Center or Training Site near you, or call Philips Customer Service.
