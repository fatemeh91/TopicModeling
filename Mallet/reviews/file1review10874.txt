review/text: I love this thing. I'm the kind of guy who like to be prepared for stuff if possible, not overly paranoid, but I try to strike a balance. I have made my own big First aid kit for my car, and I have been looking for some kind of sterile wash to clean my wounds with. I usually use tap water and slap a paper towel on it, until I can get to my car, and use proper bandage. But I was kind of sick and tired every time I cut myself and put my hand under the tap, it stings like hell, especially if you have deep wound, and then after a minute or two I can see some white stuff accumulating around the wound ( I assume these are white blood cells trying to fight off an infection from the dirt that got into the wound,plus the tap water.So I finally found this stuff. and sure enough a couple of days later I cut myself at work, and used this to wash the wound, and WOW, I could feel a thing, it was very gentle, especially cause it doesn't come out very fast from the bottle. The bottle is pressurized but not like the hair spray, this thing comes out more like tap water, high volume very low pressure. This is great cause you dont want to pressure wash your wound and cause more pain/damage., but I, like others, am worried about how long this thing will last... Thats why I bought two.. Wish they sold slightly bigger bottles for the same price, or maybe bigger bottles that are not pressurized...
