review/text: I've never paid much attention to toothpaste...I just use whatever my Dad buys. However, I noticed that when he switched to this brand, my teeth were looking whiter and brighter by the day...this is unusual for me because any whitening/brightening toothpastes we've tried before have not done a thing for my teeth.The change in my teeth was so fast and noticeable that I had to Google this toothpaste...and that's how I found this page with all these great reviews. So I decided to add mine. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth now because I can't wait to see how much whiter they'll be the next day.If you have struggled with getting your teeth unstained despite brushing regularly, I would recommend this to you. It's amazing at whitening, and I know it has to be cheap because my Dad is always looking to save a buck.
