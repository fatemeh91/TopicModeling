review/text: Nice weight, looks good. When I took it out of its box, I could immediately tell I was holding a tool that was made with pride. The finish was beautiful, everything fit precisely together. Think of going to wall-mart and buying a knockoff tool, and then comparing that same tool to a craftsman or other reputable tool maker. You can tell the difference by sight/weight/balance and feel. I also purchased a parker 22r gunmetal finish butterfly safety razor - I recommend the merkur. I learned Merkur is owned by Dovo - a reputable straight razor company located in Solingen, Germany known as the "city of blades." They have stringent quality control and a product can only be marked with the "Solingen" name if it meets the criteria for quality set by the government. This merkur razor is branded Solingen. You won't be disappointed with this product.**Note: when I purchased this razor I did so thinking it was the HD (34C) version of this razor. I became confused when I noticed it was called the classic but the picture looked so much like the classic HD. Anyway, the razor arrived and the manufacturer item number on the box is 9034001. This number corresponds to the 34C or "Heavy Duty". Apparently it goes under the name HD, 34C and 178 on the internet. I can't say if this is a mistake on the part of the various vendors or if Merkur perhaps changed the name somewhere along the line? I'm happy I got the razor I intended, but anyone not wanting the heavier razor will be disappointed. Hope this helps.
