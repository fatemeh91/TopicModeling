review/text: I recently put this lock on the cabinet doors under our kitchen sink. It is very easy for the adults in our house to use. We have tried testing it out by giving both the lock and the cabinet doors a few good tugs (without pressing the buttons to release it). Thus far it seems very sturdy and like it will do the job of keeping our little one out. It seems to be a well made product.
