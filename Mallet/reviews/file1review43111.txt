review/text: At five months of a twin pregnancy I started using the cradle. It was a lifesaver and I wore it every single day. I carried my twins to term and would have been miserable without it.I tried some of the belt type supports and they actually produced back pain. The prenatal cradle was great - it was non binding, comfortable and helped distribute the weight of my belly so I could walk around comfortably. I even used it for the first two weeks postpartum to support my overstretched abdominal muscles and belly.Update:Does get grungy looking, but used it for a second pregnancy, HUGE noticeable difference between using it and not. Relieved the achy heaviness of a big pregnant belly. Now stored away and should be fine to use again if I need it.
