review/text: I'm on my second vat of this protein powder. The first flavor I bought was Extreme Milk Chocolate. It was delicious. It tastes just like a powdered chocolate milk. I finished it and if that was the only flavor I ever tried I would give this product 5 stars, but recently I bought the Double Rich Chocolate and it is terrible. It's hard to even drink it. I have to chug it down so that I taste it as little as possible. I recommend getting this powder, but just don't get the Double Rich Chocolate. It is disgusting.
