review/text: Oxo products are always good quality and this one is no exception. It is well-designed, easy to grip and sturdily made. I always choose to buy Oxo brand items over other brands.My only complaint is that this bottle brush doesn't actually fit into any of the bottles I want to clean. I selected it to clean my collection of unusual, pretty bottles - some of them quite old - that I use for flowers. The neck size of all these bottles is too narrow for this brush. This wasn't made clear in the description. If you are looking for a bottle brush to use on narrow-necked bottles - look elsewhere.
