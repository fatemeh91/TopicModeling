review/text: I was really hoping this product would work in my closet; however, I am sadly disappointed. My closet smelled fresher for the first day or so, but by the 3rd or 4th day, any scent was long gone. My closet does not smell fresh and it definitely does not smell "ocean-air fresh!" The clothes hanging in that closet are not stinky; they are just rarely worn and I wanted something to keep them smelling fresh. On the plus side, I did not spend very much for them - they come in packets of 2. Perhaps they would work better in a much smaller closet. The closet they were hanging in was a normal sized, bedroom closet. I will not be purchasing these again, but I will continue to look for a product that addresses my needs.
