review/text: Lady Speedstick Invisible Dry Anti-Perspirant/Deodorant Shower Scent is effective, as far as providing odor protection, and does keep you dry - for the most part. I find that when I have really been doing something aerobic (I enjoy walking for long distances), I still am all sweaty. This is okay though. It means my sweat glands work! I am still very pleased with this product and would definitely use it again!
