review/text: I purcased 4 of these units as they looked like they would do the job. When they arrived, I gave 2 to my sister before I'd even tried them.I think the design could use some work. I really expected the AM and PM to be seperated and the pills do get mixed up. Next when you open them to fill them the top is heavier and they tip over while filling. I have to go to extra trouble of trying to set up an arrangement where the lids are held in place against a magazine etc before filling.I'm not happy with this purchase and if I'd not already opened them and given half of them away I would definately send them back.
