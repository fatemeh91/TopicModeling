review/text: This NiMh charger actually does charge four completely dead batteries in less than three hours. It gave an error when trying to charge some older Energizers that work fine in a slow charger. It charged Duracells, DigiPower, and Amazon pre-charged batteries with no errors. This is a good compromise over the 1Hr, 30Min, and 15Min chargers that tend to damage batteries in my experience. I also own a DigiPower 30Min charger that, while fast, can damage batteries with too much heat from the quick charging. I would buy this again as the DigiPower chargers and batteries have proven to be quite durable/reliable. Two of the included four-year old DigiPower batteries do still work in the 30Min charger. The other two still work in my slow charger.
