review/text: This is literally my first review after ordering on Amazon for many years.This inflatable lumbar cushion is really as good as I had hoped it would be. I've tried them all, the mesh one, the foam curved one, pillows, an inflatable exercise ball... What I really like about this is that you can inflate it just the way you want. If it seems a little too much, I just let a little air out. I exercise, stretch, take breaks from the office chair throughout the day, but still need the lumbar support when I sit for and this really has been the best product I've found so far. Also, I love the portability and have brought it with me to the movie theater, for music rehearsals and gigs (I'm a professional clarinetist in addition to my day job) and other places where I have needed to sit for long periods of time.It did start to leak air after a few months, but after sending an email to Dan (the owner) through his website backbooster.com, I received a response back in literally 3 minutes with a message that a replacement was on the way. For only around 15 bucks, I would imagine that an air leak is going to happen in a few products here and there. But rest assured that the owner sticks behind his product and will help work with you.
