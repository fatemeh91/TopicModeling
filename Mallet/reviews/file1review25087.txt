review/text: This battery replaced a similar one (exact specs) in my home alarm system. Hooked it up in under one minute. The terminals fit perfectly. Battery appears pretty well-built. System charged battery up and was fully operational within a few hours (normal). Would not hesitate to buy this one again!
