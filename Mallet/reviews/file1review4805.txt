review/text: I definitely do not get all of the vegetables that I need in a day, and in fact right now, I am not getting any. I was advised to incorporate the Macro Greens, as well as the Micro Reds, while I am on the Almased Very Low Calorie Diet. I admit I am a drama queen where it comes to taste and texture, and this was not very enjoyable for me, though I admit it was better mixing it with half sugar free apple juice. I emailed the Macro Greens company, and discovered that while they do not offer it directly, it is possible to take it in capsule form. So...I purchased the "00" size vegetable capsules, and The Capsule Machine, both here on Amazon, and I made a capsule form. One tablespoon of the powder equals approximately 10 capsules. Which may sound like a lot, but broken up throughout the day, really isn't bad at all. I have been taking them for about a week now, and already have a noticeable increase in energy, my skin looks brighter, my hair feels healthier. I love this product. And highly recommend it to everyone.The Capsule Machine, To fill "00" size capsulesNow Foods Veg-Capsules Double "00" Empty Capsules, 250-Count
