review/text: I used this product once, the next morning I woke and under my arms were all pimples, all red, they got progessively worse and became infected. I had a follic infection which developed into a staph infection. This infection caused me to end up in the hospital where they had to lance the area and on antibiotics intravenously for 4 days. I have a scar now for the rest of my life. DO NOT USE THIS DEODARANT. Company is very reluctant to compensate on this product.
