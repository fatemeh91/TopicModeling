review/text: I am on a six month course of chemotherapy for cancer; and my dental hygienist recommended Act mouthwash as one of my best choices for a fine mouthwash. Act works to reinforce tooth enamel and the cinnamon taste isn't bad at all. It is also alcohol free. Good!It's easy enough to use; but whatever you do, DON'T swallow any of it! You'll get really, REALLY sick. Although I don't recall seeing an expiration date on the bottle I bought last week, I would recommend that you use this before any expiration date that you see on the bottle.In addition, you shouldn't eat or drink anything at all for thirty minutes after using this mouthwash. This way the mouthwash rinse and the residual mouthwash on your teeth get a good chance to strengthen teeth and fight bad breath, too.Overall, this mouthwash is extremely good at what it does; it's reliable! I highly recommend it. If you have any questions pertaining to your own personal needs, ask your dentist before using this mouthwash.
