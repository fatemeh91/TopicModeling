review/text: This is the most comprehensive hair clipper set I have ever owned. And I have owned alot of them. The only drawback I see in this set #79524 was there was no attachment for hair lengths longer than 1" included with this kit. I am a poor man that raised 4 boys who are now men. Believe me I know this is quality. I am able to cut my own hair with these and the instructional DVD that came with the set was excellent. Not only do I say buy it I did. I am pleased.
