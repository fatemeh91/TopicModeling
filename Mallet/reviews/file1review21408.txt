review/text: This is a great toothbrush. Before I purchased this toothbrush, I used a regular Oral-B toothbrush with the rotating heads. When the battery in that one finally gave out, I though I would try something new. This toothbrush does a great job getting my teeth clean. It leaves your mouth tingling when you are done. There is a high, medium, and massage setting so you can take your pick. The end result is definitely cleaner teeth. This toothbrush is worth the higher price.
