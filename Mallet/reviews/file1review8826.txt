review/text: Wow......I don't get it!!! After reading several reviews and everyone talking about how great this product is. I rushed to "Vitamin Shoppe" to purchase this amazing product (yeah, right!!) I drink energy drinks and protein shakes on a daily bases. The taste was bearable like any other powder supplement I drink, no big deal nothing to fuss about. However, the benefits that everyone claims are so wonderful. I just don't get it. I mixed the supplement with 8oz Vanilla Soy milk and a banana. Went to work and felt so fatigue and yawned all morning, my Co Worker asked me "what is wrong with you" I took the supplement again the next morning and yawned like crazy again etc.... This product sucks and I wish I hadn't spent my hard earned money on this junk. (wow 295 viewers rate this almost 5 stars) I don't get it! I read this forum and value everyones opinion like it's the gospel truth....I'm confused.
