review/text: After experiencing occasional short term memory loss, it was highly recommended from a Ph.D in Nutrition that I begin taking Phosphatidyl Choline Complex. I was told that this complex really nourishes the brain, especially the memory aspect.I read numerous research articles about this supplement and decided to try it. Within a week, I did notice a change, as the frequency of the short term memory loss episodes dropped dramatically. I am glad to have found out about Phosphatidyl Choline Complex. I feel sharper in my thinking overall.
