review/text: Trying to put off fixing my bunion, this product seemed like a good possible solution. I've been wearing it nightly for a couple of months, but missed about three days this past week.When I wake up in the morning, my foot looks almost normal. By the end of the day, it is back in it's distorted shape, but I seem to have less pain from the bunion than I did before. And last week, after missing a few days of wear, I had quite a bit more pain in my foot.Overall, it's not a magical cure, but it does seem to be a good way to manage the pain of a bunion. And I am still hoping that over time it will retrain my foot back to a more normal position. I do recommend this product!
