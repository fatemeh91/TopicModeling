review/text: This 100 calorie bar carries an impressive amount of fiber and nutrients, and is low in sugar - but you'll never know unless you read the wrapper. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because the coating isn't as good as the chocolate caramal and peanut butter varieties. I would buy it again though, as it adds some variety.
