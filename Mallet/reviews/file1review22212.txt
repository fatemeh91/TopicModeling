review/text: I purchased theZiploc Containers Variety Packto have available for after Thanksgiving dinner. The four assorted sizes were perfect to send home leftovers with my Mom, Grandma, Uncle and Aunt. Normally they bring their own, but they never have enough. The best thing about these are that at this cost I don't have to ask for them back and knowing my family they will reuse them plenty.
