review/text: Ummm, as others have stated. Trays are to thick. I kept putting them in hot water until they were molded. They shrunk to small to fit the back teeth and really did not form fit my teeth to closely. Better than nothing, but there are better options. As they say, 'you get what you pay for' !!
