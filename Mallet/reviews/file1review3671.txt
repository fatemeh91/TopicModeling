review/text: They work but they are enormous and it seems like you need to take 3 of them to get the 300mg dose ... I think. It's not clear on the container just what a 300/400mg dose is. Is each capsule 300mg or are 3 capsules 300mg? I have to take 4 to get any results. So now I just buy the plain Magnesium and it comes in much smaller capsules and they are more effective than the citrate.
