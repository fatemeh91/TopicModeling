review/text: Having a bad back, I was looking for anything that would help the pain. I watched the infomercial and was impressed with the product. I ordered the item and it was received with great expectations. It took very little effort to inflate and I was ready to use it. It stayed inflated for about two to three hours but gradually lost its firmness as it began to deflate. It obviously had a leak. Contacted Amazon and they authorized a return.Have since pruchased another product (considerably more expensive) made from memory foam and it it's super.
