review/text: I'm a 22 year old female and I've had 2 cups of coffee in my entire life. My experience with caffeine has not gone beyond a bottle of Mountain Dew. I thought I'd try NV for the energy boost it claims to have. I didn't actually think it'd work... boy was I wrong! This is the first day I've tried it, and I cannot begin to tell you how much energy it gave me. I burnt 400 calories on the treadmill in 40 minutes. Obviously with only taking it one day I can't tell you about weight loss, but I should lose something if it gives me a jolt of energy large enough to help me burn 400 calories in 40 min. I am not a runner at all, and this is only my 2nd day of hopping on the treadmill. If you are looking for an energy boost, here it is. No jitters or crazy shaking ... expect to be wired!
