review/text: Love this razor!!! I've been using it for years and have no desire to try any of the (too expensive and cheap-looking, trendy) new razors. I, too, turned to the internet in desperation to restock cartridges. My mom did find cartridges at Walmart just yesterday, surprisingly, but I also ordered some online. I'm stocking up just in case Schick foolishly does away with this classic product....I highly recommend this product for anyone searching for a quality razor.
