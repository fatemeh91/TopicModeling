review/text: This stuff is suppose to be helpful for those on statins or heart failure. I have been taking these for a month, but cannot tell if they are helping or not. Course, there is no way to tell until the next visit to the doctor or echo. I asked the cardiologist: he recommended 100mg daily and that it is well tolerated by patients. I read several clinical studies about it, and the results were not consistent. I had 2 concerns:1) Is it bio-available? If you take it, is it absorbed by the body? It is an unregulated supplement, so this is not a given. The studies, however, showed that the levels in the body do increase measurably.2) Cost: these things ain't cheap. It is safe, but chances are good that it doesn't really help, but it might, a little. So, I have no objection to taking it, as long as you do not have to pay too much, so shop around. Note especially the price per dose.
