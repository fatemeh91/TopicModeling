review/text: Have two of these (one for upstairs, one for down) as well as the Baby Bjorn freestanding potty. With a step stool, my 2 year old can put this on the toilet herself and get up onto it. Love the little potty as well, but obviously prefer that there is no clean up required with the seat toppers. Fits all three of our toilets perfectly and very comfortable for our child.
