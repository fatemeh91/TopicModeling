review/text: This pill organizer is very helpful. The compartments are deep and can hold many pills. Each box has a morning, noon, evening, and bedtime compartment. The compartments are easy to open and close, but remain shut even when being thrown around inside a purse all day.Besides being very functional, I love that each day is a different color. It's fun, keeps me on top of my daily medications, and makes taking these medications a more pleasant experience.
