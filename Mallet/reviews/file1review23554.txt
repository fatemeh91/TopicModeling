review/text: i work for a cosmetics company where my face has to look flawless down to the smallest detail everyday and i could never really achieve that with a regular mirror, but with the triple magnification mirror i spend less time working on my makeup and can see exactly what i'm doing.the lighting is good and the 10x mag. is great for tweezing eyebrows.love it.
