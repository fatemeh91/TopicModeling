review/text: This is a decent -- and at the time I bought it, impressively inexpensive -- trimmer, but does have some limitations.Pros: Adjustable guard; on sale for cheap.Cons: Modest power (can choke a bit on my thick beard); does not trim especially close with the guard removed; no dock for charging.
