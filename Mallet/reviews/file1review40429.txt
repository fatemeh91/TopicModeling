review/text: I've always neglected flossing my teeth. Every time I go to the dentist, he says, "Looks pretty good, but you really should floss.". Then, I think, 'Why would I want to do that? It hurts so bad when the dentist does it, plus, I would have to cut off circulation to my fingers every day!'Well..., NOT ANYMORE! This thing is great! I don't even have to use floss threaders for the brace behind my bottom front teeth anymore! Sure, it's a bit more expensive than regular floss... But why pay $.99 for something that I will never use, only to have to shell out hundreds of dollars for painful orthodontic surgeries down the road for neglecting floss, then to eventually shell out hundreds more for dentures? Convenience and healthy choppers are worth the extra money! These will actually SAVE me money in the long run! Healthy smiles rule!
