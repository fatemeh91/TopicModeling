review/text: this feels really nice for penetration..the only problem i have with it is that it tends to be quite smelly no matter how many times you wash it. the smell stays but eventually fades after a week or so. it feels nice for penetration except its more giant than it looks on here. the width of it is far too much for me and also, it tends to be really wiggly so it's not great to stay in place. if it weren't for those problems i would give it 4 stars. but overall it's pretty average.
