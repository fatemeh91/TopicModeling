review/text: I began taking these prenatal vitamins with my first pregnancy, and have continued them through nursing and now during my second pregnancy. They are convenient because you only need to take them once a day and they don't make me nauseous. I was concerned that I may not be getting the same vitamin by ordering online, but I called Rainbow Light and they assured me that the vitamins all come from the same warehouse.
