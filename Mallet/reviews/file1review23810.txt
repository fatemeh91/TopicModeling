review/text: i've been taking this product for over a month and i still have joint pain, although it has diminished. i'm still hopeful that with rest and help from this product, the pain will disappear eventually. this product has not been the 'miracle product' that others have claimed. in short, i feel it's still too soon to pass judgement.
