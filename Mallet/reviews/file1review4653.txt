review/text: When I first starting using this product, I was excited. The taste isn't bad at all and I actually felt full and satisfied after drinking it. However, not long after I started using it, it started making me really sick. As soon as I finish it, my head throbs, I feel dizzy and sick to my stomach. It makes me weak and puts a horrible taste in my mouth. I didn't find any other reviews like this so I'm not sure what to make of it. I stopped using it for a few weeks, then tried it again today and I feel awful!
