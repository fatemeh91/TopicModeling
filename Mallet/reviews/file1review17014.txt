review/text: This is the first beard trimmer I have ever owned. But I am very pleased with the product it is easy to use and clean. I have had this trimmer about 3 months and it has performed flawlessly. I do wish they would make some sort of stand to hold the trimmer in while not in use. Other than that it is a fine product for the money.
