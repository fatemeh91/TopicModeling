review/text: As usual, Amazon takes no intelligent responsibility for making the dosage clearly available to consumers. THREE tabs = 500 mg (167 mg/tablet). These are not 200 mg tablets as advertised. There is no excuse for this - ALL supplements should have the "Supplement Facts" portion of the label available to the consumer. My understanding is that this has nothing to do with the manufacturer but is, instead, a decision that Amazon makes. You would have to go to another website to figure this out before you buy it. They fooled me.Whether the product is "good" or not - well, that is a different story. NOW brands is a reliable company, so I believe it is what it says it is.NOW does make a 200 mg tablet of Mg Citrate which comes in a 250 count bottle giving 125 servings of 400 mg which is a dollar or so less than twice the price of this product, which gives 40 servings of 500 mg. 50,000 mg vs 40,000 mg for about a dollar less, with the convenience of only having to take 2 tablets per serving vs three tablets. I will return these and get the other bottle. Annoying that these aren't labeled correctly!!
