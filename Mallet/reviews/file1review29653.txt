review/text: I bought two packs of these in the hopes that they would work well and I would be helping the environment by avoiding the disposable pads. Like other consumers discovered, they do not hold up at night for me. Also, when my son is nursing on one side, I find that the pad on the other side quickly becomes soaked through and my shirt is soaked soon afterward. Because they aren't very absorbant, I go through them quickly (I wash the set once every other day!), even with 12.
