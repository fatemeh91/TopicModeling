review/text: Renew Life makes quality products and this is definitely a good one. I take two capsules per day and it works great for me. A good value with this large size- 200 capsules. I cannot tolerate many fiber products but this one does not cause the side effects that many fiber supplements do. I will definitely buy it again.
