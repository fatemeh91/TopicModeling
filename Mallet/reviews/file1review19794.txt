review/text: This was the fourth different potty seat we had bought for our granddaughter to use when at our house. She uses a child-sized normal potty at day care. so the regular potties at home can be daunting. This seat is easy to use, comfortable, and easy to clean. She can put it on herself and has no fear of falling into the bowl. I sure wish Baby Bjorn had been around when my kids were little.
