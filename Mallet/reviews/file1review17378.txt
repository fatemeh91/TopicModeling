review/text: This trimmer does what its supposed to do and does it well. The only problem I had was with the protective cover on, you couldn't really get a trimmed look. Even the lowest setting leaves a pretty dense stubble. I've had to use the trimmer without the thingy - which then works well for me.The charge has held for 5 uses so far - which is great if you don't want to carry the power adapter with you when travelling.
