review/text: EDIT:One year later, I am less impressed with these. The plastic has warped, and the arch is no more (and I am not exactly a heavy person). I consider the price to be rather extravagant since these deteriorate so quickly. I think that Walk Fit might be aware of the problem. It seems that the new supports are made of a different type of plastic.______________________________I know a school teacher, who is on her feet all day. She's the one who introduced me to these, and she swears by them! I'm a college student and I live off campus, which means that it is a one mile walk to class and back. I'd been having aching feet and tight calves, but this has helped so much.Honestly, leg and foot stiffness and soreness is a thing of the past. Just make sure that you follow the instructions and break them in slowly. I know someone who ignored them and put the high inserts in and wore them all day. He hurt himself so badly that he through them out. After hearing me gush, he bought another pair, and broke them in properly. Now neither of us goes without them. They are very easy to transfer between shoes, and I have, on occasion, managed to fit them into some low heels. They will make all of your shoes fit the same, and fit right. I only wish I'd had these when I waitressed as a summer job!$20 (the Bed Bath and Beyond price) is a lot to shell out, but it will be a one-time purchase. I've been using these for four months, and I'll never go with anything else!
