review/text: i have been using lube for 9years and this is the best i have found, and i tried many.It doesn't stain, smell or even taste bad, goes a long way compared to most that claim they do but don't. unlike many lubes i have tried it doesn't end up feeling sticky feeling when it starts to dry, it simply seems to disappear but that takes time (i often wipe it off when no longer needing it there). I found this lube about a year ago at a sex shop, and me and my guy have only used it since. i love that the smaller bottle i got has a pump top so even if tipped over its very unlikely to leak lube and i buy the bigger bottle as a refill(online i have no idea what style of bottle it comes in though for smaller amount). (often keep in my pillow case so i can find it in the dark).I have recently promised a friend a friend that the next time i am somewhere that i can buy her some i will since she is new to sex and don't see why she should have to find a good lube by trying all the bad one's first if i already know of an amazing one.This stuff in a way reminds me of KY Silk (itty bitty bottle in a blue box, costs more then this stuff also) but this stuff is just that much better since it doesn't get dry as quick and also the bottle unlike the KY one doesn't feel the need to constantly leak and then stain nice bedding.
