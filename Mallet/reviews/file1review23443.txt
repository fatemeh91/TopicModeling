review/text: I have been using a Littman for several years and recently I noticed that I wasn't able to hear as well with it. This stethoscope is awesome! you will not be disappointed. The price makes it an awesome bargain and I can hear heart, lung and BP sounds very loud and clear. If you are looking for a new stethoscope this is the one!
