review/text: I have been on Prilosec for many years and recently researched the harmful effects Prilosec has on the body. I took the Heartburn Free pills along with a digestive enzyme and after two weeks, I am heartburn free! I have suffered for many years with heartburn and cannot describe how wonderful it feels to be free of a medication (Prilosec) that is not good for me and still be heartburn free.
