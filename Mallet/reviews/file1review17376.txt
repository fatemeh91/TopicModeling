review/text: This is a very good quality trimmer. The best part about it is, the battery. I use it on and off every 3-4 days, and still I have charged it just 4-5 times the last 45 days. Its got a good, strong motor- very efficient. I owned a norelco before, but that was definitely a pansy as compared to this.
