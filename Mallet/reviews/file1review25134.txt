review/text: The stuff works well, as long as you aren't expecting steroid like results. Tribulus (the main test booster here) optimizes your natural test levels, but won't push you into overdrive or give you gains like a steroid. The ONLY things that work like steroids are the now banned pro-hormones,and of course steroids themselves.If you're just looking to make the best of what your body can produce naturally, try it. I take it daily and I do notice a difference.
