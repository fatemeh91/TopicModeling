review/text: Since living in a house with a shower that has glass doors/walls, I've been searching for the best cleaner for that glass. It seemed that nothing would get the soap scum off, no matter how hard or how many different products I tried. Then I asked a janitor at my work, what she would recommend, and she said to use the Comet Spray... I ran out and bought some and have since been hooked. You simply spray it onto the walls/glass, and let it just drip down.... there is normally no wiping involved - you can simply run the shower water over the walls after several minutes after you've sprayed, and it will just wash away the soap scum and it will be clean and shiny! I was very impressed and will never use anything else! I've recommended this product to all of my friends and family, and have never heard a negative comment about it. Definitely worth whatever price tag it is marked with!!
