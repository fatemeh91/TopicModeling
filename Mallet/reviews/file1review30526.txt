review/text: I have been using this product ever since I found it a year ago. For years I tried to find a deodorant without aluminum. All the others I've tried have failed me at some point during the day. It works really well, it does apply a little wet but dries fast, it does foam if you are sweating (in hot weather), not ideal for sleeveless shirts, but its the only deodorant I have found to be strong enough to prevent bad odor all day, may need a second application if physically active during the day but no funk.
