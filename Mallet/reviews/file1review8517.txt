review/text: Mine arrived flattened on 2 sides from packaging, but after it got wet it sprang back to its normal shape. It works fine. It went in my narrow-mouth water bottles even though it didn't look like it would. It went in wet but not when it was dry. The opening on my bottle is barely over 1" (about 1 1/16")Base Brands 16-Ounce Reduce WaterWeek Bottle, Set of 5
