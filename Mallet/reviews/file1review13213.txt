review/text: My young daughter has special needs and I bought two of these pads years ago to use in her bed. They have each been machine washed and thrown in the dryer at least 2x a week for all those years and they are just now starting to show signs of wear on the quilted side. The seams have never come loose or started to fray. The waterproof side has never warped, cracked, gotten stiff, or developed leaks. It is amazing! I was looking for replacements and can verify that the Amazon price beats any I have seen through any medical supply company. I highly recommend this product and this price.
