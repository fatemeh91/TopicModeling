review/text: 16 oz of 2% milk, one gala apple, 2 bananas, 2 tablespoon of chunky peanut butter, one scoop of this protein mixed in the blender with some crushed ice and you got heaven in your mouth. Goodbye to sore muscles after the soccer game. It is intended for medium body trainers. People with extreme work out routines need to use casein protein instead. Casein is absorbed a lot faster.
