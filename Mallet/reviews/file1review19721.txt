review/text: I recommend this potty seat to all the mom's I know. We had a different brand one before buying this seat and it pinched my sons private parts. This seat is all one piece and is easy for my son to put on and take off the potty. It has a wheel that adjust so it can fit in different size toilets. It has a convenient handle for carrying and hanging and is super easy to clean.You can not go wrong with this seat!!
