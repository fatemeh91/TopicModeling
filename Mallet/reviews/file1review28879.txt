review/text: I use this whey daily. I prefer the double chocolate flavor. I think The 1 gram of sugar gives it just the right amount of sweetness. I add this to my morning smoothies with some almond milk and water and it dissolves fairly well. If you have problems with it not dissolving to your preference, adding it to something with citrus will help.I buy the 10 pound bag when I can and it's a great value. Though compared to the container, it can be a little difficult to open and close at times.I guess my only complaint is that it has acesulfame. I'm not sure how necessary it is to the flavor, but it would be nice if they could find something healthier to use. Other than that I think this is a good product.
