review/text: Remington MB-200 Titanium Mustache and Beard Trimmer. What a great trimmer, this is the third one I have ordered as gifts. All the guys that received them say that they really like the clean cut they get and that they don't have to change the head to adjust the length desired with the built in adjustible head. I will be buying a couple more as Christmas gifts. I still can't believe the price plus my shipping was free.
