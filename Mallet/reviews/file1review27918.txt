review/text: I bought this protein power because chocolate and mint is always a winning combination and this powder lived up to that expectation. I wanted something that I could easily throw together in the morning since I rarely have time to make myself a filling breakfast. I ended up also purchasing a blender bottle which worked perfectly with this.At first I mixed the shake with only milk which was very filling as I usually make between 24-28 oz (to last me until lunch). Since I was going through milk very quickly because of this I started mixing half milk/water and eventually only water. Even when only mixed with water this flavor was still really good and I could finish an entire 28 oz shake easily.Overall this flavor is very good since it can be mixed with either water or milk and still be tasty while also filling you up.
