review/text: I was hoping this product would make squinting at my computer unnessary, but the lines in the enlarger caused a weird distortion/glare. I ended up returing it after trying it our for less than 5 minutes, in various positions and distances from the screen. Returning wasn't a huge problem but I had to pay postage and that was a bummer.
