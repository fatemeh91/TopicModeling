review/text: I bought my first stick when I was in a Chinese herb store waiting for them to concoct something awful for me to drink. While waiting for my purchase, I saw this on their counter at a discount, so I figured it wouldn't hurt to try it. I find it causes pimples that have been scratched open to scar, however, if I roll it onto almost pimples or small pimples, they seem to fade away before they become big angry welts.I came onto Amazon to buy 2 more since my first stick ran out. Still don't know if they actually work, but apparently I like it enough to buy more!
