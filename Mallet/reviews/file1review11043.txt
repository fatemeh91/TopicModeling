review/text: I have used the liquid mint-flavored version of Chlorofresh for years, and hate to be without it. Unlike other reviewers, Chlorofresh doesn't completely replace deodorant for me, it just lets me stay fresh no matter the hour or temperature. The softgel version gives me diarrhea for some reason, perhaps because I have IBS -- thus the 4 stars. I only use the softgels when traveling, but slice them open to mix the contents in a glass of water.The main ingredient in Chlorofresh is alfalfa, a legume that's one of the richest natural sources of vitamin K. So no wonder it helps reduce my tendency to bruise. Could be an issue for those on blood-thinners, though.As other reviewers noted, it does turn bowel movements dark green. Just something to be aware of so you don't think anything is wrong.I have also tried BodyMint, which does not seem to be as strong (but these pills did not give me diarrhea).
