review/text: This razor is amazing. Super close shave in just one pass. Two minor flaws though. First with 5 blades the head on this thing is large making working it into tight places a bit more of a trick (especially if you are gonna use it downstairs). And the second problem doesn't help the first. The other problem is the single blade trimmer on the back. I've never used it but come close to cutting myself with it a few times forgetting it was there. Overall though it is still a great product and I've already ordered replacement blades so I won't be without it.
