review/text: This is the only thing that worked to get rid of Oral Thrush on my infant son! We tried two rounds of Nystatin and it did nothing. WARNING: This stuff stains and ruins everything! Best way to use this is when your baby is in a diaper (no clothes) and in a place where staining can be avoided. Would recommend a bathtub with water or even outside in the grass so dripping isn't a big concern. Once it drips, it will never come off without serious intervention (bleach, acetone, rubbing alcohol etc.) We accidentally spilled this stuff and used plain water to try to wipe it up and it made things worse! You can use rubbing alcohol to get it off the skin. The best way to apply is with a q-tip. Dip the q-tip into the bottle slightly so only 2-3 drops of violet are on the q-tip, drip off the excess so the q-tip does not drip anywhere and gently rub the tongue. Do this once a day for 2-3 days and the thrush should be gone for good.
