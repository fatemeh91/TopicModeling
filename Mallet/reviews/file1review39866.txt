review/text: After a few days of heavy use one of the suction cups on the end fell off. I screwed it back on but it fell off again a few hours later. The plastic hole that the screw fit into was cracked (it is not a metal nut and bolt, it is just a metal screw into plastic) and not usable anymore.These things are very cheaply made. I was talking to my mother and she said exactly the same thing happened to her.You will be tempted to buy these things because they are really cheap. But if you are stuck at home, unable to bend over or reach for things, and if this is your only reacher -- and it suddenly stops working -- then you are really, really stuck. (I am recovering from hip surgery. Fortunately I have some other reachers. (Another one I have is called EZ-Grabber -- it is almost as cheaply made as the Gopher but it uses metal nuts and bolts.)
