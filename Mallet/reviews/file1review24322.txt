review/text: I purchased my original Phase 4 (what the Walk Fits were originally called) many, many years ago. I don't know how long ago exactly, maybe a decade. At the time, I was experiencing foot pain when I walked. Rather than pay mega-bucks to get tested and then probably get a custom shoe insert, I decided to give the Phase 4 a try. It worked. The pain went away completely.This year, I noticed that the Phase 4s were looking flat. Over the years, the plastic had worn down. I probably should have replaced them some time ago. Anyway, I found that the Phase 4 has been upgraded to these Walk Fits. I purchased a pair to give them a try and am ***very*** happy.My old Phase 4s had worn down so much that using the high option for the Walk Fits actually took some getting used to again. So, I did what I did the first time: I didn't have to go back to the very beginning of only wearing them an hour a day at first. But I did go to the second step that I set up for myself years ago. I only wore them at first while at work. It is all day, but I have desk job. While sitting at the computer, you put a light amount of weight on your feet. So, your feet are getting used to the insert without having to get the full force. Then, when I get up to get something from the printer or whatever, I put my full weight on, but only for a minute or so. Pretty soon, I was fully comfortable with the new inserts.After you get used to the insert, it feels like a massage on your feet when you first walk after first putting on your shoes--at least until you habituate to the inserts. This is one of those very few as-seen-on-tv items where every cent is worth it.
