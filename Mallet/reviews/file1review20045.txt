review/text: For me anyways, the claims made by this product are true. I am doing less stress eating, and have less cravings, particularly for sweets. I am definitely sleeping better. Does the scale show fantastic results? NO. Weight loss is nominal right now, not even average, but I am on my way down the scale, instead up up. I was sick and tired of cravings running my life. Now they aren't as bad, and the weight loss is a secondary benefit.
