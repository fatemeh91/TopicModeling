review/text: I just love these bars because they help me maintain a good glucose level when I am hungry toward evening. Instead of trying to figure out what I can eat that will not push my suger up before bedtime and still be filling without having something heavy on my stomach. I take medication that helps me sleep due to pain and a side effect is that is makes me hungry. These bars are great for that midnight snack or that meal replacement when I cannot fix something well balanced while running errands and appointments. They are the best when I am traveling by plane when airport food is high in calorie as well as high in price.The only problem I have is that I live in the South and the high temps in the summer cause the bars to arrive melted. I immediately put them in the fridge but they still have the appearance of melted chocolate. No flavour is lost however.If you have glucose level balancing problems or just want a good meal replacement or even a candy bar. These are a much better choice as they have the taste of a good chocolate bar and not chalky at all.
