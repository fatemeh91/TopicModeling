review/text: I bought this monitor after using my granpa's (which he's used for 5 years) and reading reviews online. So far, I have been satisfied with the product as it seems to be built very well. The only reason I wouldn't give it five stars is because the memory and other interface functions are very simple and do not have many advanced features. It does keep an average, however, which is good.
