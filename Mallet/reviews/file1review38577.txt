review/text: I love love looooove this bathroom cleaner. When my husband and I moved to our first home we were surrounded by filth. The bathroom was the worst room. Apparently the people that lived there before us didn't care very much about being clean. There were hard water stains, soap scum, and mildew everywhere. I had to use bleach to get rid of the mildew but the Comet took care of everything else. My shower is now soap scum and hard water stain free.Another reviewer said you could just spray it in the shower and then rinse it off. I usually take a cup and wet the walls first, spray on the Comet, wipe it down with a rag, and then rinse it off. There is one thing you should know though. This cleaner has a very strong smell that burns your throat and nose. If you have a built in vent in your bathroom, make sure you turn it on. If not, leave the room a couple times while cleaning. If you breathe it in too much it is hard to breathe and can make you cough.
