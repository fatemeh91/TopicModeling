review/text: I purchased this product through amazon a few weeks ago. It's truly a piece of trash. the shave is extremely irritating and it's not closer than a mach 3 or fusion shave. It doesn't adjust to your face; so shaving takes forever, not because you're getting a good shave, but simply because it's too irritating and possibly dangerous. If you want a good, cheap shave. buy Target Brand razors. they are cheap and give you a great shave. thanks
