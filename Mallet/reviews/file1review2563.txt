review/text: I bought this for my son, who has bad asthma at times. I thought I could use it to listen to his lungs, but the quality is very bad.The diaphragm is plastic, and I really have to strain my ears to hear normal breath sounds, let alone crackles or wheezing.Upon recieving it, I found that one of the tubes was bent from sitting in the box for too long. It is irreversible.Although the stethoscope looks all right and works realtively well, I don't recommed buying it just because it's cheap.
