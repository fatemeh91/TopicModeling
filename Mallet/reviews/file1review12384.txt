review/text: I took this product along with psyllium powder while juice fasting. This combination worked very well at removing waste from my digestive track. It works by absorbing gunk off the intestinal linging apparently, and then, by adhering to the psyllium or fiber from one's diet, being passed in one's bowel movement. The results are empirically certain for one can see and smell the stuff, and it certainly removed some grime that I'd rather not have stored up in my guts!
