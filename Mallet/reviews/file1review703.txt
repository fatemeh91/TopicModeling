review/text: After much hesitation, I purchased these in differnt colors for our annual Halloween Bash! They were a little pricy for something disposable, but once I receive them I was blown away! They light up very bright and the colors are very vivid. They are soooo much fun and I am so excited to see my guests reactions to them. It was money well spent. They are durable and well made. The only drawback is the fact that you cannot replace the battery so when they die, the fun is over! But I would definately recommend picking up a set just for the fun of it. Maybe the manufacturer could think of a way to make the battery replaceable!
