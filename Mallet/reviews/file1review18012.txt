review/text: This is my second Bucky mask. The first one I bought probably 4 years ago at a Whole Foods store. Just recently, the lining started separating from the printed fabric (this was with nightly use), so I decided it was time for a replacement. My new Bucky mask is doing fine so far. Very comfortable and a good shape/fit to keep all light out. Highly recommended.
