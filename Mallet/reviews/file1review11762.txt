review/text: I'm on a quasi low-carb diet so this product probably isn't ideal for me, but nonetheless I bought it because of its 40/40/20 protein/carb/fat ratio, and I'm happy with it. It takes the stress out of having to be a meticulous calorie counter. If you do resistance training like I do, the product is great because you get a lot of protein with each serving.Taste is about average. Much better than a lot of other protein shakes/MRPs that make you want to vomit. I prefer the vanilla over the chocolate. Price is an issue, of course, but I'm reviewing quality mostly. Overall pretty happy with it.
