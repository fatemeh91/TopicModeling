review/text: I've read the other reviews on here. While the toy does have a decently strong odor when first opened, the smell goes away after usage and it doesn't stick around. This is a fantastic toy though, measures about 9" long by 6.5" in girth, which I've found is a good size for when I want to have some fun, but not go overboard. It's flexible too and the suction is pretty good as well. Overall, awesome toy. Just make sure to clean it after usage (especially anal usage), because the pink colour begins to fade to more of a salmon colour if it's not kept up with. Just like with any other large toy, lube is necessary. Lots of lube.
