review/text: The positive side of L-Arginine is well known. I've started to observe the positive effects within one week of usage. But the challenge is how to consume this nasty smelling & tasting stuff?I tried quite a few options and now am quite comfortable shot glassing it and flushing it down with orange juice! Thank God for Orange juice :)If not for the smell & taste this product deserves 5 stars.
