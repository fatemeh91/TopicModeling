review/text: Columbia Antiseptic Powder has been around for a long time, but hardly anyone carries it anymore. Gold Bond is all that you can find, but with the menthol in it, it is very uncomfortable on delicate areas of the body. Columbia is soothing, works great on itchiness, because of the zinc ingredient. Just wish it was more widely available.
