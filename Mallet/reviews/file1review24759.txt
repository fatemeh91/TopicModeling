review/text: I bought this because it was cheap and easier to travel with than my usual Taylor of Old Bond St. creams. However, I now use this more often than anything else -- it's quick and easy to apply in the morning and my fiancee loves the smell. Six months later, I still have around half of the stick left (though to be fair, I have a beard so I don't shave my entire face).
