review/text: I usually use shaving creams including Italian and English brands, but after trying this shaving gel I think it provides as good if not better lubrication and slikiness as long you are using a cartridge razor, and it is a lot faster than lathering with a brush. If you use safety razors then it is a great gel but it probably won't last that long since with safety razors one must apply multiple passes. It also includes glycerin which is rare for shaving gels. Glycerin is a great skin conditioner and lubricant. It doesn't cost much either since you can pick it up at a local store too. And if you like to use a brush to massage your skin you still can use this gel, although it defeats the purpose that is designed to be fast lather.
