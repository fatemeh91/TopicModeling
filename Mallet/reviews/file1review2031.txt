review/text: I just discovered a bunion forming on my left foot - it's not that bad so I can't say how well this works if you have bad bunions. This is just okay on mine, which was barely noticeable in the first place. It does seem to straighten my toe well - but my main gripe is the comfort (or lack thereof).A velcro piece goes around your foot and loops around a long plastic piece (you can see this in the photo), and then back again to velcro onto itself and close. In order to get it tight enough to have any effect, it has to be so tight that the plastic piece digs into my skin and it's very uncomfortable -especially since the idea is to use this as night. Also, the velcro doesn't seem to go in to the slots easily and it pinches my skin. Again, this may be because my case is minor and I need it tight to see any difference. It does work, but I find myself not wanting to use it because it's really uncomfortable and kind of bulky. The actual padding is kind of big for my (female) big toe.On a side note, when I received it the padding was discolored. It doesn't affect the functionality but I was disappointed anyway.
