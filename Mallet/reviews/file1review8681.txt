review/text: This is a great broom. The last broom I bought was in 1949 and it was a Fuller. It is still working, tho tattered so is now relagated to the barn...The Good Grips did come in a huge box but was no trouble. I was not sure about the shape but now that it is here it is a great innovation. Have no fear...buy it!
