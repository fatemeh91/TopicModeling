review/text: I originally purchased the Multiclix lancets to use with my Accu Chek Aviva meter as Amazon lists the meter, the strips and lancets in a grouping of buy these together section ; ERROR the lancet that comes with the Accu Chek Aviva is the fastclix not the Multiclix , imagine my surprise when the drum was too big to fit.Oh well I immediately ordered the Multiclix lancing device and a box of Multiclix lancets from another Amazon vendor.The original order of multiclix arrived without a hassle,the box was sealed as expected.After using the multiclix device I've discovered it's easier to hold and prick your finger than with the fastclix, and it has the same &#34;painless&#34; prick as the fastclix.I use setting #1 and retrieve an adequate amount of blood for use.There is no instruction manual on using the multiclix , so you have to go to the Accu Chek website and download it.Otherwise a great product.
