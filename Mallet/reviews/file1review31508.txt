review/text: When I received my Adventure Medical .9 I opened it up and checked the contents, everything was there that was expected. However the moleskin was not precut, a plus in my book, but others may disagree. The outer waterproof bag contains two inner waterproof bags, perfect if you want a striped down kit for a day-hike. Fully packed there is still a bit of extra room to supplement your own equipment, but if you plan on adding a lot, be prepared to remove some items. As far as expiration dates, the earliest was April 2013 but was ibuprofen so easily replaced, and the average was in 2014. Very satisfied.
