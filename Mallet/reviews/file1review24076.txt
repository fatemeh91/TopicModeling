review/text: I've bought this product on two different occasions thinking it would be easier to use than the 'Spray-N-Wash Stain Stick' which I usually use. It is easier to use, but it simply does not help to remove stains. Moreover, the perfume scent is overpowering and your whole load of laundry will end up smelling like it when one sprayed item is added. The Stain Stick (by the same company) is a far superior product as it actually works to remove stains and it is truly unscented. Don't waste your money on this product.
