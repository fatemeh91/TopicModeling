review/text: I bought some pills for myself and some of my friends to try out. They felt fine but I couldn't even take two (out of three) doses of the pill in one day. This stuff made me feel really nauseas, queezy, and a bit disoriented and restless - which I attribute to the caffeine in this product because I can barely drink one cup of coffee without feeling kind of weird.I never thought diet pills were the solution, and this product just confirms that. I strongly recommend working on the internal issues as to why you can't loose the weight instead of searching for shortcuts.
