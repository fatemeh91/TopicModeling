review/text: I tried this Irish Spring bar soap and personally I thought the scent was too strong and I agree with the reviewer that this is probably better for a man to use. Personally as a girl I prefer my soap to have a more feminine scent like some of the flower or fruity scents. I would recommend this soap for men but not for women who prefer a more dainty feminine scented soap and I think the only reason I even used this soap was because I ran out of my soap and the only thing available in the bathroom cabinet was a package of this soap.
