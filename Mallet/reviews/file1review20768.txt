review/text: Recently I was talking with a friend who has the Braun Syncro 7526. He seemed very satisfied with it and it sparked my interest in buying one. I have always been a razor man, except for a short stint with a Phillips 3 blade rotary that I paid way too much for. I used the Phillips maybe 5 or 6 times and it has been collecting dust for the last 5 years. I accepted the fact that my facial hair was either just not thick enough or grew to flat to my face for an electric shaver. I read all the reviews on Amazon prior to buying the Activator and took the plunge. I opted for the one without the lcd screen as suggested. Wow!! This thing works, I mean if you spend the time and use it properly it really works well. Like some others have said, an electric shaver will never be as perfect as a razor and cream but I'll tell you first hand that I am very impressed. After shaving there's a spot just above my adam's apple that feels like it would about 5 hour's after shaving with a razor but that's about it. The self cleaning system works very well. I don't use it every time because I don't think it is nessesary but to each their own. The fluid it uses is basically the same stuff the barber uses to sanitize his scissors and blades. Hope it works for you as well as it does for me.
