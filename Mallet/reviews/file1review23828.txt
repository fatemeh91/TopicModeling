review/text: I've been searching to find a nutritious protein bar for a couple of months now and it's nearly impossible to find anything that has a good ratio of fat and sugar to protein. All you can buy now are "lo carb" bars with a ton of fat in them. I wasn't even too concerned about taste, just so long as I could choke it down. Then I saw a NuGo bar in the impulse-buy section of our supermarket. When I read the label I almost shrieked with joy! 19g of protein but only 2.5g of fat!! Plus low in sugar and carbs and a low glycemic index to boot. I bought a few to try out and the darn things taste good too! No choking this bar down. I look forward to eating them. You really won't find a better protein bar out there folks, believe me. Whether you're a low-fatty or a low-carby, this bar will appeal to everyone.
