review/text: We used two of these rails. One is placed horizontally on the back wall of the tub. and the other is placed vertically on the faucet wall to help you get in and out of the tub. The walls are fiberglas/plastic and they grab on to it very well.These are great because there is no need to drill thru the wall.
