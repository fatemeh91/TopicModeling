review/text: Tastes awful, expensive, and why not just use pure chlorella and/or spirulina powders? Those are the best ingredients in this and any other green food supplement/superfood that is worth anything. Kelp, wheatgrass, alfalfa, are great, but not as good as algae powders. I consider them fillers for green drinks and now prefer straight spirulina or chlorella.
