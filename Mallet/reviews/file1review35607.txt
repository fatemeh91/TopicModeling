review/text: Under $100, this is an excellent product/value. I put it together in 5 minutes, no tools required. It is very stable and fits my elder mom's round bowl nicely. The hard molded plastic cleans easily. Coordinates well with the Ableware 727120000 Corner Shower Seat, another excellent elder care product/value when priced under $100.
