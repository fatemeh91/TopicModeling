review/text: Excellent product - german engineering, what can I say? Especially if you have a short beard/goatee, this is the only shaver/beard trimmer you'll ever need. Close, smooth shave. Very good trim. I did a lot of research, and Braun makes the ONLY rechargeable shaver/beard trimmer with truly universal power charger (switches automatically to any input power you may encounter on trips abroad). Battery life is great, too - much better than e.g. Philips/Norelco. Blows competitors' products out of the water.
