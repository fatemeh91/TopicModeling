review/text: The product works great. It leaves my face smooth and soft and doesn't dry it out. It protects my skin while shaving to reduce nicks and cuts. I usually use Gillette so I expected this product to perform the same. Recently I tried using Edge Gel and for travelling purposes, that can is smaller and easier to pack. If Gillette did the same, it would be excellent.
