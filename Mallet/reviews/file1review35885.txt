review/text: The way I talk about Quercetin, you would think I'm on Source Natural's payroll. I've given handfuls of this away to friends and many of them have gone on to buying their own. I take it daily as an antioxidant;(two in the morning), then if I get the sniffles or any allergy symptoms I take another dose as an antihistamine. Finally, if my back or other joints are hurting, I take it for inflammation. I'm pretty careful to stick within the 6 caplet max suggested on the bottle but there have been times when I've gone over. One benefit I find is that when I take it for allergy symptoms, the anti-inflammatory properties soothe the tissues of my sinuses and calm down the stuffiness as well as the headache I sometimes get from the sinus thing. Within a week of this being suggested by my doctor, I was able to stop using Claratin completely. It's nice to know that something so natural (it's made from the skins of red apples and red onions) can work so well with none of the side effects or drug interactions from the normal drugs (sleepiness and worse). And I'm delighted that I can get it on auto-delivery from Amazon with free shipping. I don't usually give 5 stars but this is one of the best things I've ordered from Amazon.
