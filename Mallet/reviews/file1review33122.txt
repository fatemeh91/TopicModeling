review/text: At the first sign of a cold, I follow the directions, even though it seems like a lot of pills to take in the course of the day. The cold doesn't take a normal progression. If I do get the cold, it is very mild and short-lived. When all symptoms are gone, I take one pill a day. I rarely get colds, even though I am often in the company of those who do. I believe whole-heartedly in this product. It does the job!
