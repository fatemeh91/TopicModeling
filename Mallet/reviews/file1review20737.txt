review/text: I was more than pleased after receiving this product. I have never used a razor that worked as well as this one. It's hard to believe just how well this product works, it's absolutely incredible. I want to thank the person who wrote in his review about being able to use the razor without the docking station, it was realy important to me to be able to use and charge the razor with only the cord yet this was never mentioned in all the literature advertising the product from the company. After reading the customer review on Amazon.com I decided to buy. If I hadn't found this out I may never have bought this product. By the way, the docking/cleaning station works great also.
