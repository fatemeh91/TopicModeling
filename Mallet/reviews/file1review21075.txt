review/text: This is a very high quality product that delivers a genuine "moist" heat. It is very soothing and can go from 0 to 60 in 1.2 seconds. The heat is always uniform, controlable and long lasting.I had one before, sadly lost it in a divorce. It lasted for 6 years when the ex took it.Really glad to have it's warmth and comfort now.Sincerely,B. A. Hurst
