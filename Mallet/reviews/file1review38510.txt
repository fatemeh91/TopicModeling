review/text: I got this via the Gold Box offer and I was able to use this two, maybe three times, before it stopped working altogether. And when it "did work," it DIDN'T! I got no curl in my lashes and I was EXTREMELY disappointed. Unfortunately, I'm now stuck with it, although I'm considering sending it back to the manufacturer to try to get it replaced under the warranty. Who knows ... maybe it really is a dud, and they'll send me one that really works. But if you're skeptical to begin with, don't bother buying this. Stick to the typical manual curler.
