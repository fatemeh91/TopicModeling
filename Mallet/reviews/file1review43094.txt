review/text: With my high risk pregnancy due to incompetent cervix, my husband saw this product and asked the OB if it would be good for us. It's really helped to take pressure off the cervix and also helps with those numerous bathroom troops in the third trimester! Great product. Not the most comfortable in the whole world but could be much worse. You definitely need your baby belly to be going on before you try to wear it, or it will just ride up constantly.
