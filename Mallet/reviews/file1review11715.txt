review/text: Fast shipping, good quality packaging, good expiration date. I received the item faster than estimate and it's free shipping as well. Well packaging with minimum packing material. Reasonable expiration date. Same ingrediant as I used to purchase in babyrus. Walmart still charge shipping fee. This is a good deal in all aspect. I will continue buying from this merchant.
