review/text: I received this last week. I bought it to clean jars and glasses. Does not feel flimsy, does a good job. The last two bottle cleaners I bought in the grocery store were of appalling quality. This is in a whole different class.. it works! I expect to feel the same way next month.June 2012: This little miracle lasted for more than a YEAR. I finally retired the first one two months ago and am now using the second one. Talk about value for money spent!
