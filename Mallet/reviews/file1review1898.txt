review/text: I agree with many of the reviewers regarding how well this Funga soap works.Some of the good:- The soap does what the product description states: it thoroughly cleans your feet of fungus. Generally, it keeps your feet and if you want, your body clean and healthy. I can feel a noticeable difference when compared to my regular body wash and soap.- It may seem obvious, but the bottle is a well chosen bottle for this type of product. The cap in which it comes it is a good size so that not an enormous amount of liquid will come out. The consistency of the soap isn't so thick, so the soap could potentially come out uncontrollably, but that is not the case.One drawback:- Although this soap does what it's supposed to do, more than a few times the soap leaves me with almost a burning feeling. Several times I washed my feet with a shower towel with this Funga Soap for about 2-3 minutes. Afterwards, my hands had a burning sensation that lasted for quite a while. Fortunately, the burning feeling left after a night's of sleep. Another time while I was using it on my body just for a couple minutes, I experienced the same hot, burning feeling for my feet and body.Overall, a very effective product that will give you results and immediate relief. However, be aware and careful not to use this product for too long, as it may give you a hot, burning feeling.
