review/text: I bought this 10lb bag of chocolate whey because I'm SERIOUS about some SERIOUS GAINZ! A few gym sessions after I ordered, my doorbell rang and there was the UPS guy, struggling to hold up my massive bag of whey. I was all like &#34;DYEL, BRO?&#34;. I opened the bag up, mixed 2 scoops with some whole milk, and I've been a JACKED MUSCLE TAXI ever since!!!
