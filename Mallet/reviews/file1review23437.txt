review/text: The only reason I give this items 4 stars instead of 5, is because I have owned the Ultrascope and it's only slightly better. It has the "magnified" sound due to the style of the head, just like the Ultrascope. I was using a Littman Cardiology just as a loaner after my Ultrascope tubing broke, and it's such a let down from the Ultrascope. I didn't want to pay the high cost to get a new one, so I decided to give this one a try. Guess what...? I love it! It is so close to sound to my Ultrascope, it's unbelievable, and it's so much better than the cardiology (and that stethoscope is very pricey). And the cost? My gosh, give me a break...you can't even buy a low-end stethoscope for this price, and this is a Prestige, which offers good products with warranty. Everyone that sees this item wants to know where I bought and does it really work. I can't brag enough about it. Finally: It makes a great conversation piece with adult patients and family, and the pediatric population just love it, making my life a little easier when trying to listen to the little ones. Do yourself a favor and buy this item.
