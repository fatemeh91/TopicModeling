review/text: This is my first review and I must say it could not be for a better product. Unlike others on the site, I bought this to combat my stinky feet issue. Which may be disgusting to some people, but it happens. It was not due to fungi or other similar problems stated in reviews, but more because of a general forgetfulness in bending over to wash and DRY (which is so important) my feet. I also wear ballet flats often, which do not require socks, so my feet get dirty easily. I must say that just soaking my feet in this soap has done wonders. My feet stink no longer. I would highly recommend this wash/soak. I soak it in warm water for a good 30 minutes and my feet just feel (and look) clean. I would also recommend Avon's Foot Spray and OdorEaters. They've all worked very well.P.S. The FungaSoap's tingling sensation feels so very good.
