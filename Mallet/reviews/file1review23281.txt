review/text: Like previous posters, I remember my grandmother's very old, heavy Bissell carpet sweeper. She never had a vacuum cleaner; the old Bissell sweeper was good enough. This is nothing like that one. And I, too, have the same complaint about the handle: it just will not stay once you put it together. I used duct tape to secure it. This sweeper is a LOT smaller than I expected -- even smaller than the one I'm replacing.Given all that, I am still pleasantly surprised by how well it picks up debris. I used it to pick up the dirt that was all over my balcony after potting plants, and it did a great job! It also got up a lot cat hair from my carpet. I also like that it opens for cleaning by pushing the bottom instead of pulling. And, it doesn't seem to have the rubber covering on the wheels that my previous sweeper had. (I had to replace that one -- a Casabella -- specifically because 3 of the 4 rubber coverings fell off at once!) And, I do like that it is red.All in all, I would say that it's a good sweeper, but I wouldn't use it to clean large areas because of its small size.
