review/text: What's to say? This is a cheap carpet sweeper, and it works great! The main sweeper unit is well constructed of metal and it's very sturdy indeed. However, the handle is a 4-piece tubular thingee that is marginal at best. The handle is in 4 sections so it can be shipped in a smaller box. The sweeper works perfectly on my office carpet, and I stow it away in a small file cabinet. I recommend this sweeper for occasional use, but I would suggest fabricating a solid piece of tubing for a better handle if you intend to use this for more frequent sweeping. Otherwise, the 4-piece handle will keep falling apart in your hands.
