review/text: I bought this product to reduce the inflammation in my calfs due to what my doctor calls Periphereal Edema. I had been using compression stockings and my doctor prescribed lasix to flush excess water from my system. I tried this for more that 9 months with little relief and lasix is toxic to kidneys so I was looking for a way to reduce the edema without this toxic addition to my regimen. As a diabetic...the one thing I don't need is a pill that is bad for my kidneys. So in an effort to reduce the use of these harmful drugs in the amount prescribed....I went to Dandelion Root and bought some neoprene compression sleeves...which seemed to help. Bought the Capisette on 12/28/2012 and have been taking double doses of it since then...and the results so far are more immediate than the things my doctor prescibed. The swelling is going down and the color is returning to my skin. The spots are drying out and itch occasionally. I plan to continue using Capisette until the issue is resolved and may continue to take the recommended dose forever if need be.
