review/text: I always wanted one of these, and I have enjoyed having it. The only problem I have with it is that the column is wobbly, and I wasn't able to get it to tighten up. This causes the weight to vary as much as two pounds if I am not careful about how the column is leaning (or not leaning). It helps that the balance can be adjusted to correct to zero.
