review/text: This has many uses but I use beta carotene, and lately this brand, to treat the redness and adult acne caused by my rosacea. I take one pill a day. I've noticed the best results from this product. The ruddiness and cheek cystic acne immediately cleared up. There are plenty of good beta carotene supplements out there. You don't have to go with this one - this brand just works best with my genetic makeup.I'm now doing cleanup on the acne scars by using a couple of Jan Mirini things (bio wash and c-esta serum at night). Overall, my face hasn't looked this good in a long, long time. Again, you don't have to try anything I mention here - I only mention everything that works for me because it may help someone else.
