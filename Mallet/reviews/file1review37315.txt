review/text: I actually need to buy another set! This was very simple to install and made my old clippers like new! I used them on myself, then my boy needed a haircut, while cutting his I dropped the clippers and broke a couple teeth off! I was soo pissed! Good quality that hold up well (if you don't drop them from 4' in the air!).
