review/text: The mask is comfortable and does a great job of keeping light out, but there are 2 significant problems with the design/construction:1. The strap that goes around your head is fairly bulky and takes some getting used to. In addition when you roll over, depending on how tight you have the mask, the strap may "stick" to your pillow rather than your head, thus causing the mask to shift off of your eyes.2. The bigger problem is simply the construction. As others have mentioned, the inner lining is not attached well at all to the mask. I've had my mask for a few months and the lining is now coming off beneath both eyes.
