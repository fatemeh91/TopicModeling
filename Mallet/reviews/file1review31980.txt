review/text: I have taken this product for several years. Yes, it doesn't good at all, but as some of the others have said, those of us who take this kind of drink aren't doing it for the taste. I know this goes against a totally healthy approach, but it works for me. I mix about 1/4 teaspoon of sugar-free Kool-Aid in it. It masks the flavor just enough so that I can take it. I choose a strong flavor such as cherry or raspberry. I don't want to mix it in juice as I want my juice to taste like juice. So, Kool-Aid works for me.
