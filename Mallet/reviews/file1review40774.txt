review/text: I think this is a great product for mom's. I have a 2 year old and 8 month old and my days of taking long showers are gone, this product makes shaving fast and easy and I don't have to worry about another place to put shaving cream or the rust stains I used to get at the bottom of the cans. Its great for travel too.
