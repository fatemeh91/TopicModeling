review/text: I have read lots of people stating sockeye salmon oil is the best fish oil to take and I totally disagree. I felt no different taking this fish oil verses taking any other fish oil. I guess it is just hype to make you spend more money. As the old saying goes &#34;fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me&#34;. I will not be a fool twice, so this was my first and last purchase of this product.
