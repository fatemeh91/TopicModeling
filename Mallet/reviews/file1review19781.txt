review/text: It does its job, and fits the toilet just find. I don't like the splash protector in the front; my daughter has a hard time with it. This was the very first seat we have tried, so I have nothing to compare it to. I did order another seat that folds for outings and I'm hoping it works well enough to replace this one. I know this seat got really good reviews, and I think for the most part it's great too, but I just can't get passed the big bump in the front.
