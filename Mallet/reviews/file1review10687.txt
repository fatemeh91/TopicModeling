review/text: I love this pill organizer. I have tried many plus I work in a pharmacy as a tech so I have seen all kinds. I love this since I am busy and on the go so that I can take 1 or more days with me. If I am running late and need to take it on the road then I can just put it in my purse and take my meds while on the way to work. I am going to order another one so that I can make up 2 weeks of meds at a time.
