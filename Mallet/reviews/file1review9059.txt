review/text: I have been using Green Vibrance for over 7 years now. I have been a natural health practitioner for 12 years and I fell in love with this product as soon as I was introduced to it. I haven't felt better, stronger, healthier or more wise with any other consumable product. I know it sounds hoaky to say but it is the way I feel about it. The amount of healthy vitamins, herbs, and additives in this product are astounding. I joke with friends suggesting that I feel like a super hero when I drink my fresh juice smoothies addiing this powder to them. As a meal replacement or a supplement to a smaller meal I feel full, satisfied and physically well as I consciously ingest probiotics, amino acids, spirulina and gobs more amazing ingredients. I'm sure I sound over the top and ridiculous over my love for this product. However I really am grateful Vibrant Health continues to be consistent with value and integrity in the production of Green Vibrance Powder. I have never felt more confident in a healthcare product I consume on a regular basis. My nails are truly stronger, my hair seems healthier and thicker, I feel I also have a stronger constitution to defend communicable diseases and feel generally well over all. I typically blend this powder in my freshly juiced fruits, although I use commercially produced organic juices which are also just as good, and drink with my breakfast in replace of a meal or often over my morning cereal. Initially it is a little odd to be drinking something so green and people less committed to natural health find that to be too much. The way I prepare it as a smoothie the flavors of the powder blend nicely and are pleasantly palatable. In complete honesty if someone is just transitioning to a green supplement powder they may want to try this product in tablet form. However the shift is fairly easy to make. Well, I guess I just can't say enough good over this product and I highly recommend it.
