review/text: Excellent product, recently bought another one. I often need an aid to stand and or walk. I have an assortment of walking aids: Adjustable Canes, Adjustable Canes w/Able Tripod Tips, Large Base Adjustable Quad Canes and a Rolling Walker w/Seat, Brakes and 8 Inch Wheels. Depending on what type of function I will be attending and my experiences in them help me decide what type of walking aid I will bring. I use the Small Base Adjustable Canes to public functions where I will move around and often sit for awhile, it's my personal preference. I keep both Small Base Canes in my bathroom, why two? I sometimes forget to put back my cane in the bathroom and find myself without one when I need it.
