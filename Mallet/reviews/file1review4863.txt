review/text: I have used this product before and bought it in a whole food type of place that no longer carries it (a few years ago). I decided to reorder as it really works. I work all day long and then have a 2nd job and my shoes are on all day. I have sweaty feet and it is a recipe for disaster.. This product is excellent and it works great. Just one dab will do yah.. The cream is so thick you just need a smidgen of an amount for both feet to apply to the balls of the feet and the toes. It will keep your feet smelling fresh all day, nylons and all. I bought this product in April and am just reordering it now.. You only have to use it once a week or every 10 days. My feet feel dry and refreshed with this product. It is totally worth every cent.
