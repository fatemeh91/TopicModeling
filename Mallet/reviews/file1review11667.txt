review/text: We decided to use this product because we read up on the benefits to brain development for babies. Our twins, boy and girl, were nearly 3 months premature. We started them on the oil at about 9 months old, after talking to our pediatrician about it - she highly recommended it. They've developed so much over the past 4 months its quite incredible. I really can't speak to whether it was the oil or not, but I will say that they surprise us, they're developmental specialist, pediatrician and aunts and uncles with their focus, ability to watch an action/motion and mimic it, copy sounds and maintain attention calmly for quite some time.I read another review that this large strawberry flavor was the same as the infants except for missing the D3. So for the price we went for this larger bottle. We mix it with their milk/formula in their bottles and they have no problem taking it down. The oil does make the bottles smell and nothing seems to get that out. We will continue to use this product.
