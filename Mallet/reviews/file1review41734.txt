review/text: I use a 5 year old oral-b product. My girlfriend however was using the standard toothbrush. I eventually bought the 9400 for her and she loves it. The first time she used it she said, "my teeth feel so much cleaner." Other then as a gift, I don't have any user experience with the 9400.
