review/text: The package shipped and arrived within a couple days. The battery package was exactly what you would find in any department store. Expiration date in 2017. Everything looked fine except for one thing: NONE OF THEM WORKED!!! Every single battery was dead right out of the box. I was so disgusted I took them to the nearest recycling center and tossed them in the box, so I can't comment on the return policy. STAY AWAY from buying batteries online. I have read other reviews from consumers who bought from other sellers and more than a few had this same problem. I didn't see any from this seller though. Find a coupon and buy from your local store.
