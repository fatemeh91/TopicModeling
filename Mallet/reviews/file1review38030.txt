review/text: A reviewer wrote that $1500 can buy a treadmill or patches to quit smoking, and advised that your money's better spent preventing cardiac arrest. This is dangerous, ignorant advice. That type of advice is better served in the junk food/health section. This is an EMERGENCY device. It's like a holistic doctor going into an emergency room trauma center and starting to give advice that the hundred thousands of dollars of equipment would be better spent on vitamins and a gym!!
