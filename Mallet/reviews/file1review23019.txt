review/text: Very good for any thing on the market. You sweat but its manageble. I rotate three [one bad knee], seems not to hold oder, just wear it while showering then put on a dry one. Easy to slide down while sitting or removing. I am 67 and have seen the bad results of most knee surgery. Too many people dont understand impact exersize.
