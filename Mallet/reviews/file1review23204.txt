review/text: OK...so I read the reviews before buying this and knew that the handle had a tendency to fall apart unless hammered (or duct taped). I bought the broom anyway, and followed the instructions (which do say to hammer the handle together) except I didn't hammer the handle. My kids were asleep, so instead I used the handle to pull myself up from the ground, putting all of my weight on it. I used the sweeper and the handle fell apart. So despite being worried I'd wake my kids, I proceeded to hammer the handle to make sure the pieces stayed together. I used the sweeper and it stayed together. Then my son used it, then I used it again...and the handle fell apart. So I got out my hammer and I hammered the heck out of that handle!!! I've used the sweeper at least three times a day for the last week (I use it every time my extremely messy 1 year old eats) and I feel very confident saying that the handle is never going to come apart again. OK...so now on to it's performance. THIS SWEEPER IS A DREAM COME TRUE for me and my husband (who was usually the one stuck vacuuming each and every night). This is so much easier than a vacuum or broom and it works on my low pile carpet as well as tiled floors (I haven't tried it on my hardwood yet). What's better is that my 3 year old has deemed it "his vacuum" and has taken it upon himself to clean up after my 1 year old eats every meal!!! Talk about wonderful! So mom's of messy toddlers, BUY THIS SWEEPER!!! Just be sure you have your hammer ready!
