review/text: I bought this to see if it would help remove the hard water stains/spots on my stainless steel kitchen sink and it worked like a charm. It is not recommended for porous surfaces so I was careful not to let it get onto my granite countertops. I've also used it on my kitchen appliances (inside & out) and it leaves them looking great with very little elbow grease. I think they should have labeled it "kitchen & bathroom cleaner" because it does a fantastic job in the kitchen!
