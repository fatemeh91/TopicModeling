review/text: My first 1.5 weeks on Herbalife went well. The weight was coming off. Perhaps not at the dramatic speeds you hear about in commercials or reviews, but faster than I was managing on my own; I was pleased with my progress. Enough that I ordered two more canisters from the same seller. For both orders, the packages arrived sooner than predicted, so I have no complaints regarding the seller.That's when things started to go wrong.I decided to take a couple of days off from the program to celebrate my birthday. Some celebration - I ended up with a terrible resurgence of my GERD. It was a nightmare, I had to up my Nexium dosage and start taking a tummy-coating medicine just to make the pain stop. When I tried to add Herbalife back in, it got worse, so I gave up. And now it's looking like I might have developed gallstones as well, which since I no longer have a gall bladder, is pretty interesting. The only change I made to my diet in recent memory is Herbalife, so... what gives?Needless to say, I'm hesitant to go back on it. Here I am with 2.25 canisters left, and I'm afraid to use it. Sure, I want to lose weight, but not at the cost of my health! And I was using the allergen-free version, so it can't be a reaction to soy or gluten, and I was using it with lactose-free milk!I'd like to give it a good review; I think it probably would've helped me along my weight loss journey. But if it can do this to me in less than a month... I shudder to think what might've happened if I'd kept on.
