review/text: I bought this item right before the holidays. I would be on and off a lot of planes and was in desperate need of something to make the tiny coach seats more comfortable. Even before my trip I was enjoying this product. I ended up buying 3 more as presents. As for the plane ride, it worked wonderfully, and I also recommend it for car rides. My plane ride wouldn't have been the same without it!
