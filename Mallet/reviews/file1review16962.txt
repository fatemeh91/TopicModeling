review/text: I researched several bread trimmers on Amazon after myPhilips Norelco G370 All-in-1 Grooming Systemfinally stopped working after 3 years. I ended up purchasing the Remington MB-200 because of it's excellent reviews and price of $15.PROS:* Remington MB-200 looks great, with an ergonomic design & soft material finish and seems very well built.* Excellent price!CONS:* The trimmer is extremely loud to the point that it was painful trimming around the ear area. I have never had this issue with any of the trimmers I have used in the past.* In addition to it being loud the trimmer has a vibration that makes it not pleasant to hold for long durations.* It took several passes to get the hair to be evenly cut and the look still did not look good as my low-end Norelco G370.* The charge light stays on and there is no way to tell when it is fully charged.VERDICT:I thought that this would atleast be better than my Norelco G370 given the reviews but unfortunately it was not. Returned and decided to spend a little extra money and get theBraun Cruzer 6 Beard and Head Cruzer, 6 Beard and Head Trimmer.
