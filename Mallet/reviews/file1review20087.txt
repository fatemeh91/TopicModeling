review/text: I have a large fibroid and I don't want to have surgery and researched DIM as a possible solution to my feminine problem. My doctor kept pushing me to get a hysterectomy. I say No WAY!! I believe I have estrogen dominance and started other supplements along with this product. I purchased this brand based on the reviews here and I just finished one bottle ( I take 4 pills a day) and just ended my period. What a difference in 1 month! No extended bleeding which I've been having since diagnosed in January and my period wasn't as heavy as it usually is. The clotting I was having is much less. I am going to continue taking this product. I was told to expect results in 3-4 months and it took me one month to see dramatic results. I am truly amazed and thrilled beyond belief! I am hoping each month my period gets better.
