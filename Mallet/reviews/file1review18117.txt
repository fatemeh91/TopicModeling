review/text: Update: 12/20/2011 - Reduced from 5 stars to 4It's falling apart and I've ordered another. The silky liner on the inside is pulling away from the foam. I really love it and fully expected it not to last long, but only a month? A bit disappointed. It becomes an expensive little mask if I have to buy a new one every month or so.Original Review:Unlike so many sleep masks, this one does not put any pressure on my nose. My nose is left open to breathe and I'm rather fond of being able to breathe through my nose. Quirky, I know.It's light weight and inexpensive. It fits pretty well and blocks nearly all of the light. It's not perfect at light blocking. I can see a sliver of light if I turn on my side, but it's not enough for me to notice if my eyes are closed.Over all I'm very pleased with this product and when it wears out, will be buying another
