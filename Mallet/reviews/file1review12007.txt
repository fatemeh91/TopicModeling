review/text: These pills are a great price, and they're food-based which I think is great. I'm happy with the content of them. I am NOT happy with the size of them. They are almost intolerably big. I'd much rather take two or take them twice a day if they weren't so enormous. If I didn't have so darn many left in the bottle, I'd get different ones. Oh, and don't cut them in half, they'll just slice the sides of your throat with the edges.
