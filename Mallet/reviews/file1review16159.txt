review/text: I've continually had a problem with red itchy white flake skin rashes on my knees and on my left pointer finger. My wife picked this product up in my quest of trying to get this cleared up.I've lived with this problem over the years with different doctors prescribing or giving free samples of various cremes. This is the first product that has made a dramatic improvement in the rashes appearance!If your skin is scratched till it bleeds then this product will sting for a few seconds, but the pain quickly dissipates and the desire to itch it goes away for several hours. I've been putting it on 3 times a day and it seems to be doing the trick. I hope if you're suffering from itchy scaly skin that it works well for you too. The dead sea salt and pure aloe seem to be key ingredients, but then my wife points out the salicylic acid (1.8%) is probably the key medical ingredient.
