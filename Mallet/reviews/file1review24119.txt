review/text: I have suffered from urinary tract infections since the age of four. I've had all the tests, etc., but nothing stopped me from getting them, and at one point, I was getting an infection once a month. I read in a magazine that taking cranberry concentrate can help prevent utis. I have taken two pills a day for five years and haven't had an infection since---something I used to dream of. I recommend Cranrich to anyone who has been suffering as I was.
