review/text: I was very happy with this product when I first got it about 16 months ago. It trimmed the nose hairs as well as trimmed up my ear hair very well. I made sure I maintained it well, cleaning it regularly etc. But after one year it sounded like it was working at full speed but it started to trim only about half of the hairs. Then it started to only work sporadically. I would change the battery to no avail and then suddenly it would start up again. But now it makes a very lazy wirring sound when it runs and barely trims anything. I give this item 5 stars for the year it worked and understand that all products do often have a certain life span. But whatever the cost of this item 1 year is just not acceptable. So for as a lasting, working product it gets barely 2 stars. I will buy another brand and caution other buyers to do the same.
