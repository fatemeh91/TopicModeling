review/text: I purchased this back massager for my mom after taking in her like for back massagers and having a hot stone massage. Since the hot stone massage packages were expensive and required someone else to help you, I decided to order this hoping it would help her with her back pain.Unfortunately she didn't like the massager and complained that it didn't get hot enough for her and the vibrations weren't very powerful. Now this is completely her opinion. Since she didn't like it I tried it out before I debated whether I would ask for a refund or not. I will admit the copper head seemed warmer than the stone head but neither one felt like it got hot enough to really feel nice on sore muscles. The vibration head, which is the rectangular piece you see, has a soft squish pad on top. Which is nice but the vibrations aren't strong enough to go through this pad, and it doesn't heat up either.The product itself comes with three heads, a copper head, a stone head and a massaging head that has a nice squishy pad on its head. The copper and stone head heat up and the massaging head is for the vibrations it does not heat up. One great thing about the massage is its swivel wand. You can manipulate it to reach the middle of your back without stretching your arms all different ways or becoming tired for holding it there.So in our opinion, while this massage was nice and didn't have any faults, it didn't quite give us what we wanted in a massager.
