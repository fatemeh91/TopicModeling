review/text: I just read the last review and totally disagree. That's how the FDA works by discrediting a product that isn't pharmaceutical and that actually cures a condition. If you sell a natural product you are forbidden by law to say the "cure" word. I've been using Primal defence for about 3 years. I have suffered all my life with constipation,,pain so bad I have actually passed out. Since finding Primal defence I have been a normal human being. Two months ago when the cost went up and with Christmas coming I decided not to buy due to the cost. I am now reordering due to the severe pain. I can't live without it. The pharmaceutical industry considers natural alternatives the enemy if they cure your condition, because it cuts into their profit margin. The Pharmaceutical industry make over 200 billion dollars in profits.
