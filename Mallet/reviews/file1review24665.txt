review/text: Well, this is basically just cafeine, when used as directed it works. It gives you energy and makes you less hungry. Start with small doses. Never go above the recomended dose. Tell your doctor you use it. I have used it for over a year. Start slow, maybee at half dose till your body adjusts.
