review/text: Makes shaving enjoyable. Close shave, easy use, effective head swivel, no hair clogging, and no hair snagging. I haven't drawn blood with this one regardless of the situation (cold water, no shaving cream, substantial hair growth, etc.) The trimmer is quite easy, intuitive, and effective in defining sideburns. A+ Gillette, and thank you for the free sample which brought the quality of this product to my attention.
