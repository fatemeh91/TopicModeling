review/text: This is the best product I have found on the market, having tried numerous others. Ignore the misguided and nutty 1-star reviews. This product does what it is supposed to, and effectively. Here's a brief lesson for the ignorant: if you have gone your entire life eating meat and cheese and drinking a six-pack every night along with 20 or 30 cigarettes...there may not be ANY product that is some sort of magic bullet that performs exactly like you think it should in your heads. The product clearly states start off taking 4 pills before bed, if that doesn't produce 3-5 bowel movements, increase the amount you take by 2 pills, and drink plenty of water. What is happening here I can guarantee is that: 1) you don't take it before bedtime, 2) you don't take it on an empty stomach, 3) you don't take it with (purified) water, 4) you don't drink enough water to take it or the next day, 5) you are not patient with the product and expect a miracle after one dosage, 6) you don't take it for at least 7 days.This NOT a 'laxative', just because some of the effects are similar to laxatives doesn't make it a laxative. If you get the 'runs' then that is what needs to be removed from your bowels, if it 'doesn't work' then it is because you haven't paid much attention to your bowels and there is probably decades of plaque and buildup.This product is a part of the maintenance of your overall health, it isn't a roto-rooter that performs the way you think. Try and rise above a lifetime of neglect and misinformation and stop giving silly reviews that reflect the level of your intelligence rather than anything rational.
