review/text: If you want a very high magnification, this is the mirror for you. It would work for anyone who isn't "completely" blind. The only thing I don't like about it, is the lighting from it is dimmer than my older mirror which unfortunately only has 5x magnification. So although the magnification on the new one is higher, (almost too high) it is not bright enough for me either. I am still using my older one for the better lighting and have this new one right next to it for better magnifying purposes. If you have a 5x now, I would only suggest a step up to a better lit 7x mirror.
