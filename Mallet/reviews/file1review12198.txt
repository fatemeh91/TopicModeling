review/text: I used this prenatal last year throughout my entire pregnancy and dont know what I would have done without it. I was a preschool teacher in a 4-5 year old room and needed all the energy I could get. I could feel it the days I didnt take my multi. Now, as a proud breastfeeding momma of a 13 month old little girl I still take this vitamin. It is awesome!
