review/text: I'm an average-skinny build 22 year old. I was looking to gain some muscle mass and build more all around body definition. Purchased the Double Rich Chocolate flavor about 6 months ago. I started to commit myself and seriously work out about 45 mins. every Other day. within 3 weeks I noticed more definition in my arms and in a little over a month and a half my stomach was getting more toned. Now after about 6 months, I'm starting to form what looks like a six pack. I'm amazed at how well this stuff works for me. I mix two scoops with 16 oz. of skim milk every morning and on workout days I have 1 serving with milk before my workout, and one after. My first 5lb. Tub lasted me about 3-4 months.How can I complain.The pros:Taste: better with milk than water. try to find whey that tastes better than this. There is not much else out there.Results: They were quick for me. But this was the fist time I used whey protein and stuck to a solid workout schedule.Quality: Mixes easy. Low calorie, Low carb, Low fat. 24 whopping grams of protein per serving(that's a lot!)The Cons:Price: All Whey protein is expensive right now but It is still well worth the money.so...all that being said, If your a skinny boy/girl trying to build some lean muscle or If you just want to turn some excess fat into muscle, try this stuff out. Get a routine going and it should help out.
