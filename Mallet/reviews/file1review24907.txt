review/text: We had a handsome 7 year old son and then we had 3 m/c's trying to conceive another child. We had put our name in at the fertility clinic and had not heard anything. I ordered this with the attitude that it wouldn't hurt to try. Well we tried and it worked - the day we found out we were pregnant we got our fertility appointment - we were able to give it to someone else.We had a girl that time. More recently as of 10 weeks ago we just had a boy .... I will note that both times we were only taking the fertilaid for one cycle... we will certainly endorse this!... with our 2 beautiful babies.
