review/text: I bought this protein powder (Vanilla Ice Cream flavor) after my personal trainer suggested I start taking protein shakes. The protein powder that he wanted me to buy at the gym was way too pricey for my budget (Xsport brand). So I bought this as an alternative because it had a similar composition. It is low on fat and carbs while still giving a high dose of protein.I usually mix with milk (as I don't currently have a blender) and it mixes pretty well but sometimes still get a few chunks. It has also taken me a while to get used to since I have never eaten protein shakes before, which also means I can't compare it to other products. The flavor overall is fairly good and it is reminiscent of cake mix. It tastes a lot better when I make it in a smoothie with added fruit, ice, and other mix-ins; most likely because it hid the flavor better (I use The Abs Diet recipes).I found it is a great snack for me between meals or for breakfast or after workouts. It keeps me full but it does leave me feel sort of bloated after drinking one.Buying it in a larger quantity means getting a better deal. So it's a good deal for what I think is a little higher quality protein powder.
