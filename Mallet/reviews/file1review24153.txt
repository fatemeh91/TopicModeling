review/text: I bought this combo because it was cheaper than getting both separately. I find that to be true for many of the items sold from Body Back Company. So if you are interested in a couple of items, I would encourage you to search for bundles. Anyways, the BBB is a great tool, but I won't elaborate on it here (see my other reviews for a review of that item).The accumassager is great for what it does, but somewhat limited in scope. I found that its primarily useful for the neck and shoulders. The two golf-ball like attachments are actually made of a soft rubber, which is good because it grips your muscles relatively well and feels better than a hard point of contact. They are also adjustable so you can move them along the device depending on what you want to target (i.e., closer together for neck and further apart for shoulder or legs). The limitation, as you can probably imagine, is that it is primarily designed to be a squeezing/kneading device. I would recommend this if you have neck/shoulder tension that can be relieved with a straightforward squeezing and limited kneading motion. Having said that, you can definitely get a lot of leverage with the device so you get a deep knead with not too much effort.
