review/text: So far there is little scientific evidence that saw palmetto actually helps with male prostate problems. In my experience it was totally ineffective in preventing either BPH or prostate cancer. Check with a urologist--most are skeptical, too. Basically saw palmetto has the same effect as a low-grade, weak estrogen dose.
