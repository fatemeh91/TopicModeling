review/text: I &lt;3 this thing.When we had to get rid of our dogs I kept trying to figure out WTH people with toddlers and no pets do. Now I know they use a sweeper after every meal.It's true the handle comes undone (hence the 4 star rating) but I just superglued it. Not a big issue. I've had it 4 months or so and it's still holding.My 2 year old loves to push it around but it's akward so I'm looking for a mini version so he can clean up his own mess.
