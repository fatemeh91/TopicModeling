review/text: Excellent cartridges together with Amazon's excellent cost make this an awesome product. If you happen to own a pair of scissors, there would be NO NEED to get the Frustration-Free packaging. Worked for me! I like to use these without shaving cream, just water only. Start with the single bladed side then use the 15 bladed* side. Just be gentle and you will avoid bleeding. *That was not a typo. I was just kidding though I wouldn't be surprised if Gillette released a new razor with that many blades.
