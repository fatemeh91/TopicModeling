review/text: I'd recommend this product only to people who have dental appliances. It's NOT a good floss for regular teeth. It has a thick part for flossing around things like braces and bridges, and a thin part that's SUPPOSED to be like normal floss. It isn't. It's too thick and not waxed enough, so it doesn't easily glide between teeth. But again, for people with dental appliances, it probably works really well.
