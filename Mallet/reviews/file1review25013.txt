review/text: I love to snuggle up with a good book and a handful of these sugar-free peppermints in the evening, knowing there's no sugar to hype me up (or bulk me up!) and they taste just as good as the originals. A huge step up from the sugar-free mints sold in rolls, these have solve my late night sweet tooth for years.
