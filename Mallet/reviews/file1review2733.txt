review/text: I purchased the Beanpod Patchouli scented candle and I am very disappointed. It has been burning for hours and there is absolutely NO fragrance emanating from it at all. Also, it seems to be burning only in the middle. I have purchased these Beanpod candles years ago from a store and always loved them, especially the Patchouli scent. The store in our area stopped selling them, I found this on-line and made the purchase. I WILL NOT be buying another Beanpod candle again. I could have gone to a discount store for a crappy candle and spent a lot less money.
