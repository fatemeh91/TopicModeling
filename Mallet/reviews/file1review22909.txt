review/text: I put in Flor carpet tiles and they appear to be just the right pile for this carpet sweeper to work well on. Like others have mentioned, it does not work well on hard floors, and does not work much at all in corners or edges, so I will still have to vacuum those spots. Works wonderfully on very tight short pile. I dump out a fair amount of &#34;floof&#34; so it does pick up a lot of stuff. You do have to figure out how to empty both chambers so that you don't miss the garbage. Contrary to earlier reviews, I find that the handle is strong and holding up well. Best $27 I've spent.
