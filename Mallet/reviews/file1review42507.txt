review/text: Wow, is all I have to say about this product.I was looking for something that would supplement me for my in between meals while I was doingP90X Extreme Home Fitness with Tony Horton - Set of 13 DVDs.I mix this(rich chocolate) with non-fat organic milk and it really does taste like chocolate milk. I remember when protein shakes were not so smooth and were really, really thick. That is definitely not the case here.If you want a great tasting, easy to mix(even with a spoon), and a great quality product - I would choose this one. You will not regret it. My wife even loves it!
