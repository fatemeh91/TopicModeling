review/text: After a self-diagnosis of plantar fasciitis, I searched the Internet for some relief. I found a running website that recommended rest, ice, and the Tuli heel cup (of which there are several kinds). Further investigation indicated that the Tuli Gel Polar Bears might make a good choice.I wasn't too happy when the package from Amazon arrived because I had bought nails for my nail gun to qualify for the free shipping, and they had erupted from their box and were loose in the larger packing container. Then when I tried to extricate the gel heel pads from their plastic prison, they appeared to be welded to the sides. The pads are stronger than they appeared and came out with no tears.So here is the purpose of this babbling review: Relief came with the FIRST step on the Tuli Gel Polar Bears. If you have been hobbling because of heel pain, give these things a try. They are inexpensive when you consider the alternatives.Dick
