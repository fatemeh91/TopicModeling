review/text: I bought this product to use in conjunction with my "new" diet and exercise plan. I started really watching what I eat and stepped up my exercise big time in January, and I had been losing weight healthily and consistently (i.e. 2-3 pounds a week). But once I lost about 15 pounds on my own, I hit a major plateau...I mean my weight WOULD NOT MOVE. I started taking these, and I literally busted through my plateau. I only take one in the morn and one in the afternoon with my multivitamin. I also make sure I have something on my stomach before I take these, just to make sure I don't get an achy tummy. On the downside, like a couple other customers, I had a couple of days where I got some big-time headaches. But outside of that, it's great. I have also noticed that my appetite has decreased slightly and I also don't have big cravings for the "good stuff" (i.e. Haagan Daaz ice cream, caramel cookies, etc.) like I used to. I have also noticed that my energy is just about through the roof...I'm even exercising at work by power walking for 30 mins. I NEVER even thought about doing that before these pills. I'm a tea drinker with an occasional cup of coffee, and this gave me less jitters but more energy (if you can think of that). No shaking hands, toe tapping...just raw energy. I don't get sleepy at work like I used to either. I'm on my last few days of pills, so I think I'm gonna take a break for a month and start back up with the Triple Tea ones instead. But I have to say...like any other weight loss program, to get the best results, you gotta watch what you eat and you gotta move...there's no way around it...at least for me. But give these a try...
