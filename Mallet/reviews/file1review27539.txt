review/text: Love this product. I've been using Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Whey for almost 5 years now, and it's fantastic. Very low calorie, great taste. I've tried lots of flavors, so far I've had:-Chocolate-Vanilla Ice Cream-Strawberry-Cookies & Cream-Tropical PunchThe tropical punch in my opinion is the best, because it tastes great when just mixed with water and ice. All flavors are best when mixed with milk (adding yogurt is also great), but I find that some flavors with just water are tough to choke down. It tastes like fruity pebbles. Great for a meal replacement, as it curbs appetite for several hours too. But I like this for its versatility. Not too heavy, great tasting, mixes great with water or milk. I like to blend it with 2 ice cubes, 12oz water, and a heaping scoop post workout for best results. Be wary or the vanilla ice cream flavor - very strange taste that I'm not a fan of. Cookies and cream is probably the 2nd best, followed by strawberry.
