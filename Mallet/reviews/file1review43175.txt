review/text: Method is much better than Tilex. I used Tilex for years because it was available in the local grocery store, but Tilex only slows the growth of mold and mildew. I've been using Method for a few weeks now, and I have not seen even a hint of mold or mildew. The spray bottle squirts out much more liquid over a larger area than Tilex, so you can cover the shower in less squeezes. It has a stronger smell than Tilex and is a bit more irritating on the nose if you linger in the shower too long, but it doesn't spread to the rest of the bathroom while you get ready in the morning. The stronger chemical smell has the mental side effect of making the product seem more effective.I gave 4/5 stars because Method does not reduce existing mold and mildew, and my shower has some set-in stains that it did not remove. Granted, the product doesn't claim to completely eradicate your shower of mold, but I'll reserve my 5 star vote for that super ultra daily cleaner that actually clears existing mildew, if one ever exists.
