review/text: Well, I have to say I was a little dissapointed with this item.The seller is fine, shipped it fast, etc. No problems there.It was just a little cheaply made for being over 6 dollars. The main issue is it the little pill containers don't stay latched very well. Considering the cost of medication, I really need a container that stays latched, losing meds I can barely afford as it is, is not an option for me.This device only works as a stationary pill holder/organizer, and you better be careful when you pick it up, because they come open VERY easily.Sigh... I'll use it until I find something better.I have to put the containers in a sandwhich baggy to be on the safe side. That way when they come open I don't lose my meds.
