review/text: We bought this specifically for picking up pet hair on our stairs and furniture. After a few uses we found that it is great for ordinary dirt and carpet dander. It has plenty of suction, but the brush attachment does a poor job of loosening pet hair from carpets and furniture. The spinning brush is not connected to the vacuum motor, and it sits too high up in the housing. When you push it down to make better contact with the carpet and pet hair, it easily stops spinning. In the end, we have resort to rubber gloves and water to pick up the hair.
