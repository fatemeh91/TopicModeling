review/text: I own about fifteen of these. the rubber cups come off after a month but I found if you drill the screw hole out with a small bit and put a rivet and washer on the them it solves that problem. I used a heavy glue to stop the joint problem, I never had a rubber cup come off, I do this to them when I get them, I am getting three more for the for the garage.
