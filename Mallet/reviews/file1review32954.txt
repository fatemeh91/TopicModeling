review/text: Our Labrador Retriever has had ACL surgery on both of her hind legs, and has some arthritis as a result. Joint Movement Glucosamine for humans is safe for dogs and less expensive than dog-specific brands. We pour 1 tablespoon on her evening feeding. We saw an immediate improvement in her mobility shortly after we started her on the glucosamine. She's been on it for 2 years now and our vet commented on how well she is doing at age 9. We were happy to find we could order this through Amazon. If I develop a need for glucosamine myself, I think I'll use this as well. It would be easier to take than choking on those big pills!
