review/text: We have elongated toilets in our house. I have tried several potty seats that are supposed to fit elongated toilet seats. However, they all slipped and slid on the adult seat, making it unstable for my son to sit on, not to mention that his skin could get pinched. I bought this Baby Bjorn seat because of its claim of adjustability. And the claim holds true. I followed the instructions and it fits perfectly!
