review/text: I couldn't afford to go see a masseur twice a week for my neck and back pain which causes my headaches so I thought I would try this little contraption out. It's a little funky when it comes to design but I do think that it's very useful. I use it 3-4 times a week and in combination with some stretching I feel that it's helped a little. I am happy with it so far and have already recommended it to friends and co-workers who are stressed out and have muscle aches too!
