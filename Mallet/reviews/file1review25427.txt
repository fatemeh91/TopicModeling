review/text: I paid 12.94 for this over a year ago. It works very well for trimming nose hairs as it doesn't pull them and is somewhat easy to clean.I knocked it off the bathroom counter this morning and it doesn't work anymore.It does seem pretty cheap but gets the job done. I wouldn't pay $20 for it. Was going to purchase it if it was around $10 but think I will try something else
