review/text: This has a comfortable rubber grip, a slightly flexible shaft and moderately soft bristles. I have found other bottle brushes have bristles that are too stiff and do not properly and thoroughly clean the surface. Soft enough for plastic, yet stiff enough to lightly scrub away stuck on muck. The perfect bottle brush.
