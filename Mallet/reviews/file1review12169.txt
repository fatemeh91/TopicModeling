review/text: I have used this brand of vitamins for a while and have always been pleased with their quality. I am not pregnant but like the added boost prenatal vitamins provide. Rainbow Light Prenatal Multivitamins are vegan based which makes a difference! I would totally recommend them to any woman even if they are not pregnant!
