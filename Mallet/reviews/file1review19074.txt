review/text: I heard about Mineralrich from a lady on YouTube by the name of Honesty Love. She started taking it for energy, but found that a side affect was hair growth. Since I am on a quest for longer hair, I decided to try it. I already took Biotin supplements, which Mineralrich has in it, and I was taking a B12 for energy, so instead of swallowing a bunch of pills, I opted to take the drink. I love it! My hair has grown some over the month I have taken it, and in conjunction, I am taking much better care of it, so that helps! Try the drink, it has a god taste, my stomach got used to it after a week, and I don't have any problems. Energy is good too! I will keep taking it!
