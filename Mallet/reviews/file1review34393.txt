review/text: Pros:Doesn't dry outKeeps up with your frictionLasts for hoursDoesn't have a sticky/tacky feel to it (Like glycerine based lubes have)You can remove excess lube in some cases with toilet paperCons:Stains clothes,sheets,anything cotton or syntheticYou may need to apply a lot depending on how slick you want/need to beKind of absorbs into PVC toysNot really suitable for trying to insert toys into tight spotsNot water soluble,you'll need soap and water to get this lube off your skinI use this lube because it never lets me down,even with some of the cons.I recommend using the &#34;lube launcher&#34; with this product because it will transfer to EVERYTHING YOU TOUCH if you use it in your hand and apply it... including toys,your lover,or...your toy lover.
