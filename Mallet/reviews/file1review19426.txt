review/text: We've been using a product like this for the last 8 years or so. When it died, I was afraid I wouldn't be able to find a suitable replacement. Some of the other ones we've tried actually make a clicking sound that freak out our cats. This one seems to be working great. We haven't used any bug control chemicals/devices/etc for the ten years we've lived here and we still don't have to! We see a random small spider here or there once in a great while, but nothing that tells us it isn't working. Our cats don't mind it at all. Interestingly, a while back our town had a moth worm (?)infestation and they were crawling all over everyone's exterior walls. We didn't have any on our house. That showed me these products do work (when they work with the wiring of the house). We love it! And it's one less toxin in our environment. Just remember if you have a larger house that you'll need more than one.04/20/09 updateStill loving it and still no pesticides needed!TMGandFineArt.com
