review/text: I have tried many dishwasher detergents (Seventh Gen. etc.) and this is hands down the best I have used. I refuse to use Cascade and the like, criminal what goes into them. This is a responsible company that makes a great product, have been using it for months with no issues. Thank you Amazon for carrying things I love for a discount!
