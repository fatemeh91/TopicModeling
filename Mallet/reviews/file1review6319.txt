review/text: Over the past three years, the pain from arthritis in my knees has grown to almost debilitating. Stairs are impossible. Standing for any length of time stove me up for the rest of the day. I will NOT say the pain is totally relieved nor can I bound up the stairs like I used to but this has made the pain bearable in a way no smelly rubs or pills have been able to do. I am so grateful. (And so is my boss since I introduced her to it!)
