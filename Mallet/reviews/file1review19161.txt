review/text: Contrary to what Amazon description says (as of day I'm writing this anyway) these are not Wheat/Gluten free, one of the ingredients is Wheat sprout and rainbow light website does not state they're wheat/ gluten free either.My kids are allergic to gluten and my 2 year old was getting very moody...I suspect it was these because as soon as I realized they have wheat and threw them away he's back to his happy self.If my kids did not have allergy I'd probably still be using them.
