review/text: My hygenist recommended these for a couple of weird spots in my mouth that are difficult to keep clean with floss. I really like these little things. They're perfect for dislodging debris in those areas which are too wide for floss to efficiently clean.We'll see how well this review holds up after my next hygiene appointment in several months.
