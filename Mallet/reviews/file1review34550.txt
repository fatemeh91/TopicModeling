review/text: On a 1 hour hike by a stream, we had to reapply this several times. My pre-schooler, who has pollen allergies, sneezed rapid fire for quite a while after each application. I wanted something natural and may have continued using this despite the need to reapply, if it weren't for the sneezing.
