review/text: I have been using Dry Eye Relief nightly for about 5 years now. It is the only product I've found that works for me. I have tried all the other over the counter drops and gels and many prescriptions as well. I get dry eyes mostly at night and find I can put these drops in my eyes anytime they are dry and get immediate and long lasting relief. I no longer wake with my eyes beet red from trying to get them to tear when I'm sleeping.
