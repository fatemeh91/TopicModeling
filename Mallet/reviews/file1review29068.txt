review/text: Like another reviewer, this razor replaced a decade old Norelco lift-and-cut shaver. Perhaps I've just been spoiled by that, but seeing as my 10+ year old razor with 10+ year old blades gave me a closer shave in half the time as this brand new fancy gizmo (the old Norelco didn't even have the problem with an extra-day's growth that this one does), I'm rather disappointed in that aspect.That said, I do like everything else about it. It's a really convenient size, adequate clippers, and the beard trimmer does the job. If you're looking for precise control of beard length, go get a dedicated trimmer, however, because the 4 settings just don't offer the exact control you might want. I'm also very impressed with the batter life.If you're looking for a real close shave from an electric, don't bother. If you're looking for something that does a better than adequate job, has a lot of useful features, and is reasonably priced, this is a good option.
