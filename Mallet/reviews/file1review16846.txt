review/text: This information is sent in response to the "review" of Teenertot. I'm John Wettlaufer, the Consumer Relations Manager for HoMedics, Inc. We have read the review about the fire and our product could not have caused this fire. Our product contains two C batteries which will not cause a fire. We have sold many of these products (and other products with batteries) and have never heard of anything even remotely like this happening. When we tried to contact Teenertot (real name withheld)and her insurance company, who is investigating the fire regarding this matter, they refused to give us any information. We investigated the matter ourselves and learned that the Los Angeles Fire Marshall has deemed this fire as "Arching of an electrical outlet situated behind thesofa". The cause and origin expert has confirmed that our product did not cause the fire. We will be requesting that Amazon and Teenertot immediately withdraw this review. HoMedics prides itself on providing safe, useful products and stands behind those products 100%.
