review/text: I've owned several different electric shavers over time and this one does pretty poorly if I try and use it once a day, but if I shaved in the evening as well as my usual morning ritual, it does great! That does make it a minor inconvenience to use, but overall the time I use to shave (once taking into account the time to slather on the shaving cream before and aftershave afterwards) is less than before. I personally haven't had any issues with the battery life that others mentioned.
