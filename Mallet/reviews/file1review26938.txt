review/text: not much else to say other than the title of my review. i've been drinking the ON Vanilla Ice Cream for 3 months now. It is delicious and definitely helps me stay on my diet and I know i'm getting the Protein i need with my workout. I remember the days when i used to have to plug my nose to drink the MetRx shakes. Those days are well behind me, i look forward to drinking this stuff and it does satisfy my hunger. I throw a raw egg white in there for a few extra grams of protein too. I mix 32 oz of skim milk and 4 scoops of shake in the morning with the raw egg white and waaaala i have 135 grams of protein waiting for me for the rest of the day. That along with my other meals gives me plenty of protein for the day. I definitely recommend this shake to anyone wanting to make sure they get enough protein or even anyone that wants to cut down on their carb intake.Ohhh and i'm very picky about the taste of protein shakes. This and Muscle Milk are my favorites but stopped drinking Muscle Milk...too many calories and frustrated they stopped making the Root Beer Float. Hopefully ON will make a Root Beer Float flavor one day.
