review/text: This is my very first trimmer, so I didn't have anything to compare it to. But I did notice right away that (a) it doesn't hold a charge very long and (b) takes a while to do the job, with a lot of passes. The short charge life means one more charger I have to take on vacation. It needs so many passes to do the job it takes longer than it used to take to shave, and the battery starts to wind down before I'm done. My now-retired Panasonic shaver would go a week and a half of daily use on a single charge, and I'll be looking for something that good after I get a few months out of this thing. I won't buy another Norelco.
