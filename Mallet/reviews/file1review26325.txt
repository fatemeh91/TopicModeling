review/text: I have chosen to use this Vital Nutrients CoEnzyme Q10 brand.Though it is more expensive than other brands, as I have tried other company brands of CoEnzyme Q10.Through experimenting with the other brands, I have found that Vital Nutrients CoEnzyme Q10 has made all the difference for me.The other brands caused me to have different unpleasant reactions / side effects.Do to being very sensitive to foods, chemicals and vitamin nutrients, this is the vitamin I have chosen and trusted to use. I have been using this vitamin for quite a few years and have not had any problems with it.
