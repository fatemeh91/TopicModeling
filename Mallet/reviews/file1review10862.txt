review/text: I thought I was only ordering 1 battery, and at that price I was happy. After it arrived I saw 6 and had to recheck the listing and found out that was correct. Excellent price and shipping was fast. I use these for my Harley security system fob, and having extras is only a plus. Highly recommended.
