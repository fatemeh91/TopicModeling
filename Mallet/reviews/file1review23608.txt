review/text: How you do rate a product you have not used? MY low star review is not due to my using the product - but rather the fact that the product has obviously changed formulation over time and all the newer reviews claim that the it is different than in the past - now using cheaper ingredients. The old posts give glowing praises - the newer ones NOT. So, I guess I will skip this product line and try something else.
