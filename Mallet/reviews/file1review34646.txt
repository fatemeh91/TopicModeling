review/text: I love the fact that I can get all the benefits of coconut oil without having to eat it. Tried to eat just the oil on a spoon, use it in my cooking and melting it down and just swallowing it but I could not do it! This is way easier! My only complaints are you do have to take a lot of pills and the cost.
