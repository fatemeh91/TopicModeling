review/text: we have this and two bjorn potty chairs -- adding up to three pottys in a very tiny NYC apartment. But there must be inspiration in numbers because my very stubborn four year old is finally training!!!!The seat is comfortable for him. Catches all! and we are just thrilled.This is one bit of Gear BabyBjorn got right. Don't even hesitate, grab this, grab the step stool so your childs legs don't dangle..get a potty chair for the other rooms, and perhaps your child too will be inspired.
