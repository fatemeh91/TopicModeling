review/text: I have a long distance relationship with my boyfriend, so I figured I would purchase my first vibrator for the time being.First of all, I can't say enough about the packaging. I actually know the man that delivers packages to my apartment and have a male roommate. Discrete and very well packaged, I must say.It is fairly quiet on low. The higher speeds can be a bit loud, but I doubt anyone outside a door would notice. (Unless they are listening for vibrator noise = weirdos)It seems pretty sturdy, but does smell like a medical glove.It is huge. I tried it a couple of times, but it is just to large for me. I have an overall quite petite frame and a novice vagina.So huge, in fact, that it actually hurt slightly.I think this would be great for someone that can accommodate a wider vibrator, this thing feels like a baseball bat to me. My boyfriend is not that well endowed, hopefully I can find something similar to his size. Any suggestions would be great. For now.. it seems I am back to a non mechanical relationship with myself.
