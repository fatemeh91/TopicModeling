review/text: A couple of weeks ago my doctor told me she wants me on an anti-inflammatory diet. So I have been doing a bunch of research trying to find anti-inflammatory foods. The best one I have found so far is garlic. The problem is that my husband is not wild about garlic and hates the smell in the house. I have even gone outside to chop it but of course then I have to bring it in. I hate the smell of bacon in the house so I really sympathize. Anyway, the research I have done says that in order to reap the benefits of raw garlic, a garlic supplement must have the garlic smell. This sure does! Each pill is sealed in a plastic bubble with a foil back so you can't smell it until you pierce the foil but once you do, oh boy, garlic! Then there is the problem of burping garlic, I sure don't want that if I ever expect my sweet hubby to kiss me again :-). These are enteric coated so they don't start digesting until they hit your intestines. I took my first pill last night. It smelled so garlicy I was worried I wouldn't be able to put it in my mouth but I did and swallowed it down and that was it. No upset stomach, no burping garlic, no garlic breath, perfect! Now, everyone says that garlic is this amazing food that will do all kinds of good stuff for you but I don't know if those things are really measurable from a lay person's standpoint. But I'm going with the research and using this product, I figure it sure can't hurt.
