review/text: My cat was not urinating very well and would squat in the corner in a strange way and wasn't acting normally. A few days after using Pet Alive for UTI's and she is back to normal. It is easy to use. I put a bit if the granules in my palm and mix it in her canned food on her plate. She gobbles it right up not knowing anything is in it. The service was fast and easy. The seller wrote a personal Thank you on the order form, which was a nice personal touch. I will order this again!
