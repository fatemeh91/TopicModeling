review/text: After a recent surgery, my scar began to itch terribly. But what was more troubling was due to the placement of the scar from the surgery the nerves had been severed. So I was trying to rememdy my itchy scar and could not feel the relief from scratching. This product has helped calm the itchiness from my scar. The tip on the bottle is rounded and lends itself to helpful massage while applying.
