review/text: I bought the pills last week me and my husband have been trying to conceive for 2 years already. I know its me due to a previous relationship but the doctor did some blood test and said everything is fine and i should be able to get pregnant im guessing its because i am irregular but hopefully these pills work the wonders that has worked on others i am so excited to start taking them!!! i will update if we ever get pregnant;)
