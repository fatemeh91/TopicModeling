review/text: I must tell this is my second Sock helper aid. I had knee replacement could not of live without this product. The 1st one I still use up at lake but I needed to replace it with a new one, old one looks petty used and I do not have to carry one to the lake anymore works great, Easy no bending to put socks on easy to use slip sock on aid then slip foot in pull on then shoes.
