review/text: There is nothing wrong with the products quality. My problem comes from the size of the capsules. They are kind of large. You have to take 4, 3 times a day. I would prefer this product in a powder rather than a pill. I always use the powder but wanted to try a capsule because it's easy on the go. I will go back to powder once this bottle is finished.I just took four right now and feel like they're stuck in my throat...
