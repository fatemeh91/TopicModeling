review/text: I recieved this item and was pleased with it. It was not as hot as the old one I had but still gave enough heat to remedy most of the pain. I really do not understand why so many said it did not get hot enough. I found it be very warm and it could of been very uncomfortable if left in the same spot for long. It was effective and the amount of heat was perfect, in my opion.
