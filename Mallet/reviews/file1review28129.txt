review/text: So I purchased this flavor because it was the cheapest out there and I can compromise flavor over price. I think we all know that optimum makes darn good protein powder. Probably the best for the price, in my opinion. SO yeah, i was surprised with the taste of Cookies n' Cream. Tastes much better than I thought... definitely you can pick out the cookies and cream (there are actual little black particles in there for the cookies!)and I would venture to say there is even a hint of tootsie roll in there, haha.
