review/text: My wife and I have been trying to have a baby for a while. My counts were on the low side of normal after cancer and treatment. Within one month of taking these vitamins, she's pregnant. Now I don't know whether this has anythng to do with it but since they're just vitamins, it doesn't harm to try and honestly I am more than impressed with the results if true.
