review/text: I have a previous Panasonic nose trimmer model which I purchased over 8 years ago. I use it often, as I find excessive nose hair offensive. Although my old model works very well, I ordered this model over 1 year ago to have a spare in my hygiene kit, as I am often on the go with very little advanced notice. Although both models trim nose hair excellently, his model, Panasonic ER411, is more powerful than my previous model, trims faster, and finishes the job in less time. The end result is, however, the same for both; an excellent trim. This new model, ER411, is just as easy to take apart and clean, as the old model. One improvement, besides a more powerful motor, is that the cap has vents that allow for air drying with the cap on, and the cap will also prevent the trimmer to inadvertently turn "ON" via an innovative locking mechanism.
