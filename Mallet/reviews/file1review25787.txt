review/text: The decision to purchase this product was based on the old theory, "you get what you pay for". Not true here! This being the most expensive nose and ear hair groomer offered on most sites, I assumed it was the best! On the contrary. It was very painful when used in both my nose and ears. The rotary tip literally grabs the hair and pulls it from its location. Ouch!! My advise...go with the $20.00 model!
