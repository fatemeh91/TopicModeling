review/text: Comes in two hand railing widths: for a medium sized person, and a larger person, and priced accordingly. This review for the medium size. User 5' 10," 170 lbs. Worth the extra cost compared to lesser costing ones. A 5 yr. old could assemble and install in a few minutes. No screws or bolts. Do not have to remove existing toilet seat or cover. Only 4 pieces to fit together. When assembled, simply set in place. Once in place - it is unmovable solid. Obviously that is important. Seat shape design is totally comfortable. Normal shipping via UPS from New Jersy.
