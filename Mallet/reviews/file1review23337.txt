review/text: First off, this shave soap sells for six bucks on Burt's Bees website so don't pay anymore than that. I love the smell of this soap and combined with the Burt's Bees Bay Rum Aftershave, it's a fantastic combo. I had no problems lathering it up in an apothecary mug with a boar brush. It does dissipate a little too quick which knocked it down to four stars for me. However, the soap does hydrate well for a smooth shave even it does dissipate a little. The bar is pretty hard so I think it will last a while compared to softer soaps. A great smelling and good shaving soap.
