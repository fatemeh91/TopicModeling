review/text: Tried MotionEaze for a 1-hr bus trip. Applied it on my 9-yr old and mefollowing the intructions that came with it. It did not help.Gave MotionEaze another try on a 2-hr plane trip for my 9-yr old and me.We both still felt dizzy and had that tummy discomfort of feeling likethrowing up. Then finally, my 9-yr old did throw up. The plane tripwas a little turbulent, but that is exactly what I expected MotionEaze tohelp with.I bought Bonine for myself and it was absolutely helpful on our cruise.We also took a 45-minute ferry ride and you could really feel the boatmovements a lot. That normally triggered motion-sickness for me,but with Bonine, no problem whatsoever. One side-effect though is thatBonine initially made me a bit sleepy, but just a little bit and foronly a few minutes.Bottomline, if you can take Bonine, do it. If not, cross your fingersand try MotionEaze or a sea band. Maybe you'll be one of the lucky fewwhich gets some benefit from it.
