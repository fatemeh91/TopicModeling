review/text: I had a Waterpik in high school that I got because I had braces. I continued to use it after I got them off until my brother helped himself to it when he moved out. Fast-forward quite a few years to now. I brush and floss but felt like my teeth just weren't as clean as they should be so I bought this Waterpik. It is still basically the same as my old one except this one has a lot more power and comes with a tongue cleaner. It is so perfect! I drink a fruit smoothie for breakfast in the morning and a kale smoothie at night. I use it twice a day after smoothie time and this thing blasts out all of the little fruit and vegetable bits hiding in my mouth and leaves my teeth sparkling clean. I have it on a middle setting and cannot imagine needing (or being able to stand) a higher setting. They should really consider using that higher setting to mine diamonds. The first few times you use it you will make a big mess until you get a system established. I just hang my head over the sink and blast away until the reservoir is empty. The higher you set the power the quicker you will go through your water. I put a little peroxide in my water for extra cleaning, but you certainly do not have to. The tongue cleaner didn't seem to do much so I only do that once a day. If you have a friend with dragon breath buy them one and tell them that you enjoyed it so much you wanted them to have one, too. It will make both of you happy. Happy cleaning!
