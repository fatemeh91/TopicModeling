review/text: Purchased Thyroid Support first part of January. It did help with mood, hair fallout, etc. However I developed acne followed by a severe case of acne rosacea, possibly due to side effects from ashwaganda and other herbs in the formula. I would love to keep taking it but am afraid to as it seems to have cost me a trip to a dermatologist at $175 plus a long future course of antibiotics. Any suggestions would be appreciated.
