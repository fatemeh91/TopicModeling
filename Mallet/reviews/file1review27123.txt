review/text: I exercise at least an hour every day. I take protein after ever workout every day. I have been doing so for quite a few years. During my time trying different proteins, this has to be the worst yet. I really don't see why this has such high ratings. It's a complete ripoff. The price for this crap is terrible! The best protein I have tried to date is by far Body Fortress Super Advanced Whey Protein. The price is much better, it contains everything optimum has plus more more recovery supplements already in it. It feels much more filling and tastes far better. I would recommend staying away from optimum nutrition. If you don't believe me, just try Body Fortress yourself. You can get a 2 pound container for only $15 at Walmart or several other stores/sites. You won't regret it. You will regret optimum nutrition after trying body fortress though.
