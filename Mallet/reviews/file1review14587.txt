review/text: I have been very high strung kind of person and have trichotillomania. I read about studies using this to treat the disease so thought I'd try it. I've been using it daily (1/2-1 tsp every morning) for the last 4 months, and while I don't seem to be pulling any less, I am a LOT calmer. I went into this thinking it wouldn't work and family has told me I am more "normal" now, so I don't think there is a placebo effect. It is a very fine powder and is slightly sweet. I think this one works better than the Jarrows brand and a million times better than the Rugby brand tabs. If taken in large doses this puts me to sleep (accidentally grabbed the 1/2 tablespoon measure instead of the 1/2 teaspoon measure the very first time I took it, ha), so would be good for someone with insomnia. I LOVE this and recommend it to everyone with "mood" issues.*Disclaimer: This is in NO way medical advice, just what has worked for me.
