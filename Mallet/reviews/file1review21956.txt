review/text: I am very unhappy with the results. I ordered 4 bottles of Serum Vitality and only received 2 bottles with my ship,emt. I immediately contacted the company that sent the product and advised them of the short shipment. I was advised they would correct the problem and send the last 2 bottles immediately. To date I have not received the missing bottles, even though my AmerEx has been charged for 4 bottles.I AM ASSUMING AMAZON STANDS BEHIND EACH PRODUCT RERESENTED ON YOUR SITE. PLEASE RESOLVE THIS SITUATION OR REFUND THE COST OF THE UNSHIPPED PRODUCT.Fix this problem or I will stop using Amazon!
