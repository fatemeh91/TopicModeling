review/text: My 20 month daughter started to say 'pee pee' whenever she wanted a diaper change. We found she wants the diaper change when she was about to pee (or poo) when her diaper is already heavy and she does not like to wet the carpet or the blanket. So I thought maybe it's not so early for her to start potty training.We got this Babybjorn toilet trainer delivered, and tried to put on the toilet - and as a curious toddler as she is, she asked me to put her on it (in her own language) then started peeing and she even tried to clean with tissues (she just dumps the tissue - I think she caught that from her big sister). Since then, she tries to stay away from diapers whenever she's not traveling or sleeping.She's on the heavier side at 30 lb. She sits on it very comfortably alone, but smaller babies might have to find a smaller stand alone type potty trainer bowl.
