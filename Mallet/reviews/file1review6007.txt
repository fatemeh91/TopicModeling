review/text: This is a must for travel! My Cardiologist recommended I purchase one and he told me this was the one I should buy. It is simple and easy to use. Before leaving on my trip I checked it numerous times along with my regular monitor and found it accurate. Now after returning home I continue to use it as it is so easy and simple to use.
