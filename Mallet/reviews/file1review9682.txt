review/text: Nice looking glasses but a little small for a man's face I think. But the real problem is right after I cut the tag off and went to wipe/clean the glasses before putting them on, one of the lenses popped right off with no effort. I tried popping it back in and barely was able to get it on but it was fragile, kept popping back off before I got it to settle in, gingerly put in on my eyes but the lens was barely hanging on. Returned the item.
