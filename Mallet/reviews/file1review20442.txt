review/text: I suffered severe pain in lower back, buttuck area. Went to doctor and to Chiroprator with little relief. I felt if I could be held by my ankles upside down to stretch my back was what I needed. I read reviews on the Tush Cush and decided 'something else' to try. From my very first seating on the cushion, I could tell immediately that something was different. The best relief I've experienced in a long time. I pack it now from seat to seat and to the car until I can get another.
