review/text: I've shaved with Braun electric models since early 1980's. They were great products then, but their foil/cutter durability has degraded badly under Gillette, now P&G (they should give away the shavers, since they are really selling high-margin disposables.) The thin foil and cutter are now designed to wear out rapidly: I shave carefully, have moderate beard growth, but still only get 4 to 5 months from a foil before it breaks and nicks. Forget their 18 month change suggestion--it won't last that long. If you don't mind the high expense of consumables, the 8000 series does provide a very clean comfortable shave while the foil is new. I find shaving quite fast in the first month, considerably slower by 3rd month, then watchout for foil failure and nicks. If you want durable performance, get a Norelco rotary. When a Braun foil breaks, I use a 1960's vintage Norelco triple-head. It still works just fine, and only costs electricity since the cutters last several years in daily use on my beard. Its downside is manual cleaning, and a shave (old cutters/thicker foils) not quite as close as a new Braun foil/cutter. It also takes a little longer than a new Braun foil/cutter to get a good shave, but it's faster than a 3-4 month old Braun f/c.
