review/text: Once I started using this bath gel I've never bought another! The gel froths up into a wonderful silky lather (it's almost like being in a bubble bath) which rinses off easily and leaves you feeling squeaky clean. The clove scent is very pleasant (if you like the smell of cloves, which I do) and not overpowering.This is the first time I've used it with the pump and so far I'm finding it very convenient as I just leave it in my shower's windowsill and pump it into my bath scrubber.
