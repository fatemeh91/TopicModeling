review/text: Can someone tell me how reducing the amount of loads you can wash while keeping the price the same make this a better product? I have been using All Stainlifter Powder Laundry Detergent in the 120-Load Box which weighs 27.8 lbs for two boxes. The "new" All only washes 40 loads and weoghs 18.8 lbs for 4 boxes and costs the same amount as two boxes of All Stainlifter. If you buy enough of the "new" All to wash 240 loads it would weigh 28.2 lbs but would be in 6 cartons instead of 2. So I bet that the extra packaging to ship six boxes of the "new" All would weigh MORE than shipping two boxes of All Stainlifter, not LESS.So how does changing the formula make this product easier to ship if you have to buy six boxes instead of two when the extra packaging probably makes it HEAVIER to ship?Instead of getting 240 loads out of two boxes of All Stainlifter I would have to buy six boxes of this "new" formula and pay 50% MORE than I was paying before. With "savings" like that I will be in the poor house in no time!So I gave this product 2 stars because it really is a good working detergent but the cost per load is 50% higher than the previous version. So it looks like I will have to look for another brand that gives me more for my money.
