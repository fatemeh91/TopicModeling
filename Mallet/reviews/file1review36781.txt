review/text: I have been using a "Stocking Aid" (an item that is difficult to find) for about 20 years due to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Some have been excellent This one, however, is literally unusable. A stocking aid needs to be flexible; this one is extremely rigid. Not only is it impossible to place a sock over it (not enough "stretch" in the sock), but it does not allow your foot to "slide" down the aid into the sock. My recommendation? Do not purchase. There are ones available that work amazingly well.
