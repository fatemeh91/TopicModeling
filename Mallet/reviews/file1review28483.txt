review/text: This is my third time buying a 5 lb container of Chocolate flavored ON Gold Standard Whey. The flavor is just ok, which is the best you can expect in a whey supplement. If you've ever had Trader Joe's vanilla soy protein, this product will taste like sweet ambrosia.It is super easy to mix, which is very important. I usually dump a dry scoop of it into a used disposable water bottle and mix it with water at the gym. It mixes so well, there is no need to have a special shaker bottle, unlike some other products.The flavor is ok. I made the mistake of buying the vanilla flavor last time - it's sickeningly sweet. Do not buy vanilla! Stick to chocolate or double chocolate.I noticed that after a while, the unused product starts to thicken a little and stick to my plastic funnel; I assume that the powder starts to absorb moisture. My solution was to tie a cheesecloth sack full of uncooked rice to absorb the moisture, and it is working pretty well.
