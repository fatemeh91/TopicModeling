review/text: Worst electric shaver in my life (I've owned three in 40 years.) It sounded like an unbelievable bargain, coming from Bell & Howell. And "unbelievable" it was. Can't believe they put their name on it. Cheap construction, useless shave. It took longer than shaving with lather and razor -- and STILL didn't get everything. Irritated skin through repeated attempts to get a decent shave on any given area of face. Screen broke after just over 90 days of trying to use it -- thus blocking the rotary "blades" from rotating. I threw the thing away yesterday. Save your $20 and put it toward a Norelco, if it's rotoray you want. Personally, after this experience, I've gone back to blades and lather. Faster, cleaner, no irritation, great shave -- and cheaper. I feel like a fool for having believed the ubiquitous TV ads for the Tri-Tek.
