review/text: I bought these blades and was overcharged on shipping by $28.00US If you check the fraud pictures posted on the internet these fall under the fake category.I bought these for friends and family and i get responses that these blades do not stay sharp. The blue glide strip does not wear like normal ones. No serial numbers, Indent on outside of cartridge that signifies fake blade the metal clip holders not bent down to hold blades secure to cartridge again are being sold as fake.Just not the same shave as authentic blades should be.Not happy with purchase
