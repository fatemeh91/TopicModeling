review/text: My parents used to pass these off as candy bars to me when I was a child in the 70s (with the carob coating and peanut butter filling, I didn't even know I was getting vitamins in every bite) and I've yet to taste another protein bar that was quite as satisfying and yummy.Now that I'm in my 30s and pregnant, I started craving Tiger's Milk Bars and had a heck of a time finding them in local nutrition stores. I was thrilled to find them here -- especially with the great price and fast shipping. They taste as good as ever and I don't have to feel guilty about eating them daily, with just five grams of fat per bar. (And as it turns out, this is what my mom craved when she was pregnant with me!)I've ordered these several times and will definitely keep doing so - especially now that my husband is hooked too!
