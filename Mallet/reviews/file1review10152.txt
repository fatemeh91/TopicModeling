review/text: I usually drink a smoothie each day consisting of a banana, frozen blueberries, fresh spinach, a bit of orange juice and lots of water and ice mixed with one scoop of this protein powder and I really like it. I find it a filling meal that is not heavy and satisfies after a workout. I also like that it is very low in sugar and carbs. For the price and nutritional value, it is the best tasting protein powder I have tried.
