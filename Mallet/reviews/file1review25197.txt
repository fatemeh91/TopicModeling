review/text: It works great ! I had not used my headphones for over 2 years so the old battery expired. Then I realized it was an older headset and batteries might be rare. I found this and still somewhat skeptical from some of the bad reviews I ordered it anyways. Heck I can't buy a headset of that quality for $16.- !! It fit perfect , works perfect and i'm a happy camper !
