review/text: It has extremely greasy feel to it and it is way too slippery.Not that much pleasant experience.Feel like diesel and even light washing with soap isn`t good enough, to get rid of it.Most women don`t like it .Stick with water based especially if your women is self conscious .Best Yet is "Baby Lotion" and you`ll not be disappointed.
