review/text: I've had my Sennheiser cordless headphones (HDR 65) for several years now and they have not broken yet, not even a tear on the fabric, or a loose switch. The battery I believe is li-ion since is feels so light, almost like a empty case. With a full charge it last well past a full length movie, nice and loud, and when the battery goes dead it's simple to pull the back up battery out of the transmitter base and swap them out and keep going! Never really run out of juice. My batteries finnaly died after 6+ years of ownership, not bad!Con, when the audio is low enough you can hear radio hiss in the headphones, but that's not detectable at a deceant level of listening.
