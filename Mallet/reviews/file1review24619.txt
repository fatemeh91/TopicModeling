review/text: I think I've reviewed this item before. Anyway, I find I'm much more focused, driven, aware, awake, alert, quicker to answer when someone catches me off guard, and more energetic (not jittery). I used to be a personal trainer and I did recommend to some clients who needed to lose a lot of weight quickly (like before their wedding or graduation) use either this product or Xenadrine because I've tried them and they work and I find them to be safe. HOWEVER, exercise and proper diet are the tried and true methods. If you're in a hurry to drop a few pounds: Get a trainer, exercise regularly, eat right and sleep well. These products are helping hands if you're in a big hurry or to get you over the edge of that plateau. Only take them in moderation. Like other similar products, these recommend you take up to 3 pills 3 times a day half an hour before each meal everyday. If you do that you only have about 9 days worth of use. Personally I take 3 pills once a day (right before I drive to work) and I have an easier day at work.
