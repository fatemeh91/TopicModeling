review/text: I purchased the cane for daily use. It works as advertised, clipping to tables and such.My only complaint is that the strap is too short to go around my large hands and was held on by a flimsy aluminum tab which broke during the first day of use. I plan on buying a new more robust strap for the cane as I like it very much. Also,it would be nice if they mentioned what size replacement tips will be needed as I probably will need to change it in a couple of months. Again, not bad for the price. Almost forgot, don't let the picture fool you, the canes main body is plain aluminum in color, not black like the picture would make you believe. It would have been nice to have the whole cane be black in color.
