review/text: I really like the color of this tint, it's a nice splash of color without being too shiny, or too bright that it looks like lipstick. I do not like the smell though, for the price it's kind of a given, a lot of inexpensive makeup items have horrible scents. For a better scent and some tint and shine I like MAC's Slimshine, smells like vanilla almost.
