review/text: I have had this for a couple of months so far and no real problems. Just wish the head had a latch, or attached more securely. Luckily hasn't come off while I am taking out those nose hairs. But I am satisfied with it. Comes with two other head extensions, one for sideburns and the other I think for ear? Butt hair? Haven't used it. For nose works great. Nose hairs (along with nails), drives me crazy when not trimmed and this works great, Easy and fast.
