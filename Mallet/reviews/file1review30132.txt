review/text: Another great product for the kitchen and particularly for you the Chef.I don't know about your area, but where I am it can be tough to find vanilla beans and sometimes when I do find them I'm not willing to pay the price being charged.This product solves both problems as it is reasonably priced and a great tasting product.Buy a container and you will soon be using it in your cooking
