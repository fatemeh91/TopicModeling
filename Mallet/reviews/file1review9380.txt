review/text: When DH began having to take a number of meds in the evening it got confusing. He has a large pill dispenser that works very well for his morning meds but he could no longer keep up with the evening meds and was afraid he would make a mistake. He needed something that wouldn't take up much space but that had at least two compartments for each evening and would need to accommodate larger pills. This product seemed ideal and a bargain at 6 bucks.But with his arthritic hands he had difficulty handling the little pocket pods. The pod dimensions are about 2-1/2"L x 2"W x 3/4"D and surprisingly stable within the tray. The corners are rounded--perfect for carrying--but they are not easy for stiff fingers to grip, to open, or to hold steady while filling or dispensing. His initial remark was that it would be better if they were square. While he must exercise great care in filling and opening the pods, he is using this little dispenser quite successfully. In hindsight even though it costs more than twice as much I probably should have bought7 Day 4 Compartment Pill Organizer DEEP One Inch. It's likely I didn't see it because it was not prime eligible.This dispenser really is a good idea! Load the little boxes and put them in your purse or pocket and you're off! But for someone who has difficulty using their hands, this is not recommended.
