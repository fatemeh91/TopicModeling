review/text: I really wanted this to work....but it didn't! I purchased this at our local grocery store, because the Rubbermaid containers I wanted were out of stock. I am so sorry I did not wait to get the other brand. The lids of the EZ Store, which are supposed to fit each container, fit snugly only on the middle-sized containers. They lifted right off of the large and small containers -- they are neither air- nor water-tight -- they can barely hold food!I took the food out of the two large containers I was going to use, filled the containers with soapy water, set them on the counter, and 10 minutes later my counter was covered with water! The containers were leaking through the bottoms.This product seems like a great idea, but in practice they simply do not work. They are very poorly manufactured.
