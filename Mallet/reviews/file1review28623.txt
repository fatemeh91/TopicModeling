review/text: I have been using the protein powder from Provida Labs, but switched to optimum since this was a lot cheaper. This has a lot of protein, but very low in sodium, fat and sugar and I very much like it. The only reason I cant give a 5 is because of the taste. But don't get me wrong, this tastes good and sweet but not as good as the protein powder i am used to from Provida Labs. This is my opinion on the Vanilla flavor and I'll try chocolate the next time.
