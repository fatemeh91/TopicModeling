review/text: I have cut my own hair twice already with the Wahl Clippers. I wear my hair pretty short and tapered. This does the job with relative ease. I absolutely hate going to the barber shop!!! Paying anywhere from $10-$22 for a good short haircut every other week is crazy! Now I don't have to wait in line and I don't have to listen to some guy/gal run their mouth while they butcher my head! Thank God for these clippers!
