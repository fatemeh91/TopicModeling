review/text: OK. If you wanna get picky, they're 33.05 cents per bag. That's not outrageous, but I'm a family of one. Plus I keep bag requirements down by recycling. If you're a family of more than that, you might want to get a more durable thicker trash bag & maybe you can find a cheaper price somewhere - personally I don't have the patience to comparison shop for trash bags - I figured 3 for a buck is fine. At thirty gallons, they hold quite a bit, not industrial size but often more convenient than smaller kitchen bags, They work ok for average use, but they're not close to being heavy'duty. No ties are included but that's not a big deal, just can't maybe fill them as full as if there were ties, 'cause you need enough bag to crimp up & then tie in an overhand knot. They're opaque so the neighbors can't see that hubby's wife is clandestinely throwing out his collection of old Playboy magazines. :D
