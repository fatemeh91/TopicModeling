review/text: I ordered this 2lb jar to see if I liked the taste enough to use Amazon's subscription service for the 5lb product. In a little over a week of changing my dietary habits to multiple small meals (5-6, at least two or more are just a protein shake) spread out every 3 hours, while exercising daily, I have noticed myself being more energetic, less fatigued in the mornings and a loss of two pounds. Not bad for a weeks work. The best thing is, is that I'm not hungry most of the day. Keeping your meals spread out to a 3hr max keeps your metabolism working continuously and keeps you feeling satisfied all day.But about the product, Its mixability is superb, its taste is subtle enough to mix with water or milk without it being too sweet. In water it taste like Mexican Horchata, in Vanilla soy milk it taste like a true vanilla shake. Whey contains the best protein for your body, meaning your body absorbs it and utilizes it more so than other types of protein (ie. soy).For weight loss and muscle gain, this is a no brainer since about a third of your daily calories should come from protein.
