review/text: I have two elderly dogs who have accidents in the house. I have purchased several of these pads and they work as wonderful "boo-boo" pads. They are absorbent, they don't leak, they are washable and they are much more reasonable in cost (and larger) than the "boo-boo" pads sold for pets. Highly recommend - even for people.
