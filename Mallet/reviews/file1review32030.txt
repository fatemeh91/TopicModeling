review/text: I've been taking this product for the past two months now. It is a great product and swear by it. At first, I was a little skeptical when the guy at Whole Foods sold me the product. I'm still using the product two months later! Many of the reviews state it tastes bad...here's my what I do and it doesn't taste bad at all! Mix 8 oz of skim milk or soy milk with a scoop of perfect food and a scoop of whey protein powder. I add a banana or a mix of blueberries and raspberries with it. It tastes great plus you get the antioxidants from the berries. Enjoy and feel great!!
