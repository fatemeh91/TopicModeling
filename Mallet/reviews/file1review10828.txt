review/text: I did quite a bit of research and these scales live up to the reviews I read (almost all of which were positive). They are very repeatable. I will add one negative note however. They are trying to control too many functions with too few buttons. Holding a button for the wrong length of time can cause you to enter the incorrect mode. I am not an unintelligent person, but it took me 4 to 5 tries with the instructions to finally set up the memory features correctly. They have been great since I finally got it done though.
