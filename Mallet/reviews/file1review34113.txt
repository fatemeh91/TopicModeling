review/text: I've tried the Schweta brand of henna a few times over the course of my career as a henna artist, and it has always disappointed me. It's very easy to find a tube for under $5 at most Indian grocery stores.Mixing your own henna is a much better way to go. Buying this kit might be a bit useful so that you can see what consistency the paste has, so you can keep that in mind when making your own.
