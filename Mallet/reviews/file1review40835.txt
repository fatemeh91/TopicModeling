review/text: If you have never tried the Intuition Razor you are in for a real treat. Before I would buy the traditional ladies pink shavers and then I had a coupon for the Intuition, so I decided to try this one for a change. Now I am a devoted user because I get the fastest closest shave ever! My legs aren't dry when I am done and I find that I don't have to moisturize my legs as often due to the huge amount of shaving gel which surrounds the actual razor. You don't have to use shaving foam as long as the gel isn't used up, afterward just use the foam or gel as desired. The blades stay sharp for over two months if you shave three times per week. You gotta love it!
