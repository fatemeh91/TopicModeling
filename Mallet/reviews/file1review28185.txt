review/text: Definitely the best tasting chocolate protein I've ever purchased. It mixes unbelievably well. I'm planning to buy some other flavors to use with cereal, etc., but so far this is the only one I can speak for. I reviewed several competing products and this one was cheapest at the time; it didn't disappoint!!
