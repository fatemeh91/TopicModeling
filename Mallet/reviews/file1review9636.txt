review/text: My wife has had a problem with the skin on her fingertips cracking for several years. She has tried many products and techniques for dealing with this situation. She has also been to several doctors and read many articles. Nothing seems to be a significant cure or treatment. She does use rubber gloves anytime washing dishes, etc. She regularly puts moisturizers on her hands during the day and at night she also uses ointment on her hands and covers them with white cotton gloves. This product is as good as any, but did not resolve her cracking skin problems.
