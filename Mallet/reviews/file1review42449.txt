review/text: I rehab and foster exotic birds and other rescue animals. As a holistic approach, I include ProBios in with my birds' food, as well as all other (cats, dogs, guinea pigs, small and furry, etc). Any rescue hamster is immediately given this in their diet, as stress contributes greatly toward 'wet tail' disease. I also use the product with the 'human' family...Originally recommended by my birds' holistic vet; it is a great product--better than yogurt (IMO)and easy to use. It tastes great, so no one complains, either. Use as directed. Can be mixed in with any food.
