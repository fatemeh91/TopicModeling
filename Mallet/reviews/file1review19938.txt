review/text: I was looking forward to having my son (barely 2) use this toilet seat. After we got it, I was extremely disappointed. The adjustable dial did not fit to lock onto any of the toilets I tried in 3 different houses. Without locking it into place though, there was still minimal movement, so it wasn't a big deal. What was a big deal was the mess that happened every time my son peed. The splash guard is not tall enough, and unless he points his penis down just right, pee goes EVERYWHERE. I finally got sick of the mess and put the seat away. He just straddles the regular seat now, which is not as comfortable I'm sure, but it does the job with no mess.Also, my son started to not want to go potty on the big toilet after we'd been using the seat for a couple of weeks. He wanted to sit on the stand alone fisher price frog potty. After I put the seat away, he stopped going on the frog potty and went back to the big toilet. I don't know if it was a coincidence or not. But this seat was definitely a waste of money for us.
