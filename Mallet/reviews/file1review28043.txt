review/text: I bought this back in April and now again in November. This is a great product. You can use it for strength training to lose weight while gaining lean muscle. It has a great taste. Me personally, I mix it with Hood Calorie Countdown Fat Free milk. This whey protein mix is low carb and very low sugar (so this should be diabetic safe). This is a great price for the product since health stores sell this for aprox $80+. This could be used in conjunction with exercise to build lean muscle and burn fat or you can use it as a small meal supplement throughout the course of the day.
