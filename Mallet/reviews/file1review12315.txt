review/text: I am so sad that the Itch Zapper has been discontinued. I still have two that work, thank heavens. I get bit. A lot. Mosquitoes love me, even when I am doused in deet. So when I discovered the Itch Zapper, I finally was able to enjoy the outdoors, knowing that if I were bit, I would be able to control the itch so that I wouldn't scratch off the bite and make it ugly. Why did they stop making this product? So sad. However, I have found that using a Bic lighter can serve the same function, if you are careful. Turn on the flame, let the metal heat up, wait til you can touch it to your wrist and hold it there, then apply to the bite. Pretty much the same thing as the Zapper, just powered by lighter fluid rather than battery.
