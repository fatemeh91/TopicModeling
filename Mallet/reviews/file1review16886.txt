review/text: This product seemed great at first but has become very disappointing, the tabs attached to the seat part have bent after very little use and cannot be bent back into place making it a struggle to place and remove, you just hope you don't get splashed when trying to remove it. I am currently pregnant and it is very uncomfortable dealing with this, I need a potty that will allow me to easily lift the part I need to clean up. I am ready to buy a different one.
