review/text: I'm leaving a review for this product because I believe the very negative review was rather unjustified, in my opinion.My husband has been taking this product on an as-need basis for years. He gets a specific condition that enables us to know whether a probiotic product actually works or not. This one is very, very good and is more reasonably priced than most others. We have tried many that don't work.If you get canker sores (small ulcers) in your mouth after eating acid-type foods such as too much tomato sauces, walnuts, or rancid oils in nuts, etc.; try this product. My husband has had this painful problem since he was a kid. The doctors did nothing for him. When we married many years ago, I got him on a product such as this (not made anymore) and his pain and sores would disappear in 2-3 days (depending on how soon he started taking them). Without this product, it takes 3 painful weeks for them to disappear. His problem is a good test for us to determine whether or not these types of products work or not.The only reason he doesn't take them regularly is because he is anti-health supplements unless I can prove without a doubt he needs them due to a condition. I, on the other hand, intend to use these regularly for my problems. My own review got me motivated!Hope this helps. Thank you.
