review/text: I bought mine at Walmart for around $12.99. I ended up buying two boxes because I read suggestions to test twice a day. Of course on my last strip in the first box, I got a positive result! I tested around 3pm as suggested, and I posted a photo of my results on the product photos. I racked my brain with the negative results since the lightish pink bar for result always shows up, but you can see that a positive LH surge shows up much darker. I really don't think you need to buy a more expensive brand. I used an online ovulation calendar to pinpoint around when I should be ovulating, when it was time, I started using these strips, so my advice would be to use an online calendar to ballpark your week, then just buy one box, even if your paranoid and use two a day like me you might catch it. :) My cycle is a bit longer than most, with the last one being 35 days, and the calendar still got it right to the exact day. Best times are 3-4pm and 7-10pm. And don't drink a ton of water before testing. Good luck ladies!!!! :)
