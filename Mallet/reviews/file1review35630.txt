review/text: I started using AMBI back when I was in high school. I was experiencing a lot of breakouts at the time and I had numerous acne scars on my face. I used this cream as one would use a moisterizer, by covering my whole face with the product. I would also dab a little on each pimple and scar before I went to bed. My face started to clear up almost immediately. My friends at school thought I was using makeup because my skin looked so clear and radiant from using this product. I would have to say that some of the effects of this product have dramatically decreased overtime, and I find that I have to now alternate between other creams to get the same effect with AMBI nowadays.(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review.
