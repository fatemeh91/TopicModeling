review/text: I was a little worried that these picks wouldn't be the same as the ones in the small red container. They ARE the same, the same nice and skinny perfect picks.Walmart stopped carrying these, I tried a couple of others that they did have and they were so fat I couldn't fit em between my teeth - whats the point of that? These picks are perfect, I have one or two spots that I struggle to fit it in, but otherwise they work perfectly, and are the same picks I've used for a very very long time.
