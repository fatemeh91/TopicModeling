review/text: This morning I woke up with a muscle spasm in my right shoulder from sleeping in a strange position. It was very difficult to move my head to the right and I knew exactly what I needed. I felt the trigger point and knew that it needed to be massaged and have pressure applied. I grabbed my BackBuddy like I have so many times before and went right for the spot.The Backbuddy is an amazing invention that will allow you to hit points from your feet to your neck. It's a very clever tool and along with a book on trigger points like this one (which I bought):The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook: Your Self-Treatment Guide for Pain Relief, Second Editionyou have an entire method to self-treat during those times when you can't make it to a massage therapist or chiropractor.I am not a doctor or medical specialist, but I have used this method on myself (I have MS) and have found adequate relief at times. I keep my back buddy handy and was certainly glad I had it this morning. It's the type of thing that you probably won't need everyday ... but when you DO need it, it is WONDERFUL to have.I highly recommend it.
