review/text: I bought me this from where I work and let me tell you this, I don't regret it at all!I'm not really the type into pampering and stuff like this but this stuff is amazing. It's easy to use; just rub it into your feet during your shower then rinse it off. After I get out and dry my feet off, they are always so soft.Not to mention it smells so good! This item is worth every penny!
