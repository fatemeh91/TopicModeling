review/text: This is a great little tabletop fountain. The pump can be adjusted, and the three streams of water are adequately audible to hear over everyday household sounds. The lamp works well, lighting the back from below, and we threw some colored glass stones on top of the screen to add a little interest.We've had ours for several years and I was shopping for another.
