review/text: While I looked all over town and the internet for a toilet riser that would work in my mother's new assisted living apartment, she fell off the riser she was using temporarily. The toilet at her facility is bigger than any elongated riser I could find, but the legs on the Invacare Toilet Seat with Arms sit firmly on the floor and provide great stability. The arms make it easy for her to stand up and ease herself down. I wish the rest of her world were as safe for her as this seat is!
