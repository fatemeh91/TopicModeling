review/text: If you are looking to use this just for your legs - great. I got it less than a week ago and love it. The first time was not pleasant but not terrible. It does take some time but after a few days most of the hair is gone so it is quicker. BUT....underarms and bikini not good. The biggest issue is the curve of tweezers has an angle that does not match other parts. The hair that was removed left red bumps. So I would say great for legs but that is all.
