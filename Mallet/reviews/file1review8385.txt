review/text: I use these types of brushes for my soda stream bottles which I carbon water in and then add flavoring if I want to. The bottles can not go into the dish washer so this brush is great for hand cleaning those bottles. Also it is great for people who carry around reusable metal water bottles since the bristles are non-abrasive!This is a solid company (good grips) and I usually find them at bed, bath and beyond but online it was so much easier and cheaper to buy this product especially since it was Super Saver shipping.
