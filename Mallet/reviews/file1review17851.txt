review/text: This forumla is the least offensive to the stomach when I tested several kinds by drinking 16 oz each. The only thing I'd like is for Enfamile to make an organic formula. The existing organic formulas (other brands) have inferior choice of ingrediants. It's no good to have organic cane sugar for an infant (Simulac), for example. Lactose is much better. While one organic brand does use lactose, I didn't like the exact foruma as well as Enfamil. It's no best choice, just a very good one.
