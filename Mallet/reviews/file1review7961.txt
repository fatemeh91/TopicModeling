review/text: Nobody likes washing dishes, and as far as I'm concerned, anything that makes it a little easier and less of a chore is well worth the money. I've used variations of soap dispensing sponge brushes for years now, and they've become a requirement for doing dishes. No more getting your hands filthy doing the dishes, the handle keeps you a safe distance from the week old salmon soup you're trying to scrub out of your pot, all the while dispensing the right amount of soap to cut through the grease.My only complain with these has been that I always get the cheap ones and then find I can never find replacement sponges. Buying a larger brand like the OXO Good Grips solved that, though I would still recommend stocking up on sponges, as I go through about one every other week.
