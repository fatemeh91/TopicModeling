review/text: I wanted to order these TWICE. The product seems great, the company...not so great.I placed two orders with FootSmart. Both did not go well. Terrible, listless customer service at the 800# and no help from the customer service link listed on the Paypal site. A computer generated response from the customer service link assured me an agent would contact me soon. That did not happen. Both times I spoke with customer service they could care less and were limited on what they could do and on knowledge. The first item was not advertised clearly, so I was told to cancel/re-order to adjust it... Then on the second order I paid for overnight which I was ultimately charged for, but on the email receipt (received the next day) they slated it for 2-3day anyway. Even their email receipt showed that the cost of the item and the "standard" freight they assigned, cost LESS than what the total amount they were charging me (which was still an overnight amount).They werent going to even contact me, but just charge a gastly overnight rate and send it standard.I was listlessly told an email would follow showing the orders were canceled. Ya right. I have to keep checking my paypal account to ensure that it isn't still "pending" charges. FootSmart seems to have some cool products, but don't expect fast shipping or good communication if there is a problem. Hopefully if you order something, it will arrive in 7-10 days, you'll be charged correctly and the computer generated receipt is all you end up needing.
