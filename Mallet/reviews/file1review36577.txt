review/text: I have what I consider moderate seasonal allergies. When I start feeling like I'm going to start sneezing or eyes are itching I take 3 of these & within a short amount of time I'm feeling better. Another plus is that you can take more a short amount of time later if needed unlike OTC or prescription medicines. I've discovered that it doesn't work as well for animal allergies such as when you go to someone's house that has cats or dogs & you start sneezing uncontrolably & have extreme nose running. Maybe it's not supposed to since it is technically for hayfever.
