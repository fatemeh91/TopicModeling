review/text: I order this after it being recommended in my birthing class. It came the day of my worst back pain yet. At first I did not notice a difference but after wearing it for about an hour my back pain subsided to a tolerable level. Now I wear it everyday. I am currently 29 weeks and had the product for two weeks and would not go a day without it. The other review are right about the straps being visible with open neck tops, but for me the benefit out weights the fashion. My only advise would be to wear a cami under it, it makes it that much more comfortable.
