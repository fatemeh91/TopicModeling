review/text: I am partially deaf and need aid to understand words on TV. I cycle a pair of these batteries for my well-used Sennheiser headphones; one in the phones and one ready in the recharge slot. They take quite a number of recharges before battery failure. This is just the second pair of replacement batteries I have needed in well over ten years of almost daily use of my headphones. These bulk packaged batteries, so far, have been just fine, and for a much less expensive price than the retail packaged ones. Be sure always to give a complete charge to a new battery before its first use.
