review/text: I've included Green Vibrance in my diet for over 10 years. It provides all the greens PLUS (just read the label to see all the other good-for-you ingredients are in there). I mostly put it in breakfast smoothies, sprinkle it on greek yoghurt, or sometimes just mix it in a glass of water (it's not about the taste here, just the benefit, tastes like you'd think powdered greens would).
