review/text: Pros: This is one unique product that conveniently contains all the tools we were looking for. I'm actually surprised there aren't similar products found through out the web but this was the only one I found. The tools are effective and so far working. Nothing has broken/fallen apart yet in the past 11 months.Cons: This product is poorly produced. Unlike the other reviews complaining about shoddy workmanship, ours looked liked it was dug out of the trash. I tried cleaning it but the metallic stains on the frame of this tool is tough to remove.Conclusion: I care more about effectiveness than attractiveness so I gave this product a 4 out of 5 star rating.
