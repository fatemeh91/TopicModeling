review/text: First, if you have stomach pains, dont take it on an empty stomach (for example when you first wake up). If you do, you can get stomach pains and nauseated. Eat something and then take the pill.I've been taken 2-3 a day, and my sperm count is great, and motility is great.Started with 38 percent motility -> new test shows 95 percent.Started with 15 million sperm -> new test shows 30 million sperm (great!).It does work. Also, caffeine is the one thing that I thought would cause a problem--doctor says its the one thing that helps the motility..keeps those little buggers jumping! :)
