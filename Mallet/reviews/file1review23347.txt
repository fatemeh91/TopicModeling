review/text: This product was recommended by the nutrionist to help my daughter (17 months old) gain weight. My daughter is a fussy eater and is on the lower percentile in weight. I was given samples by the nutrionist. Tried it and once I was satisfied bought this can.The powder dissolves easily. I only mix it with liquids though this can be mixed with anything. This does not add any taste. Basically this is tasteless. After using this powder (no other food changes), I found my daughter to be having a better appetite. She also gained weight due to the additional calories. I only use one scoop a day.
