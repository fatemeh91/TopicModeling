review/text: Okay - I read some reviews stating that the Waterpik Water Flosser was 'loud'. I had no idea what I was in store for.I live in an apartment. In my opinion, this product is completely unusable for anyone who lives in an apartment. I heeded the noise concerns of other users thinking I would use the Waterpik at an acceptable hour, say 8pm instead of 11pm when I'm heading to bed. I would say there is NEVER a good time to use the Waterpik; it's that loud. If you have any respect for your neighbors, you will not want to use this product at any time. The noise can best be described as a motorcycle idling in your bathroom.Even if it does what it's supposed to do, I think a one star review is warranted because of this unacceptable flaw. Maybe the noise is unavoidable based on how the motor works, but I don't think that is a reasonable excuse. In that case, perhaps more R&D; needs to go into this technology before products are placed on the market. If you still plan to by one, all I can say is be warned, and own a house.
