review/text: After reading an article on the benefits of Tea Tree Oil I went looking for products that contain it. Many were very pricey and didn't really give recommendations on how to use them; like the oil. Since I have some dental issues and had read about the properties in tea tree oil that guard against bacteria I thought this would be a good experiment for the price.I'm very pleased with how convenient it is to pop a toothpick in my mouth and gain healthy results. After about 15 minutes my teeth feel clean, free of plague. It leaves a fresh taste in my mouth and feels soothing. It seems to add moisture to my lips and mouth, relieving me of a 'dry mouth' feeling that is a frequent occurrence.I'm happy with the results and will keep purchasing them.
