review/text: We just bought new stainless steel GE appliances for our new kitchen and I was so worried about the fingerprints and all the negatives that people say about stainless steel appliances... I was hesitant but I love the look so I went ahead and got them.... I also bought these wipes and let me tell you that my appliances look AMAZING after cleaning them with this product... it's very easy to use!!! I recommend it 100%
