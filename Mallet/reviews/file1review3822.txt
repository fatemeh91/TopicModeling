review/text: This tea has a pleasant cinnamon like aroma and has a cinnamony/Carob like flavor. It take longer to brew but is worth it! It takes the edge off stress and is an enjoyable tea for morning or nightime! I take it in the morning 1/2 hour before stressfull meetings and 1/2 hour before I go to sleep if it has been a stressful day. I like to stock up so I am prepared when things get tense!
