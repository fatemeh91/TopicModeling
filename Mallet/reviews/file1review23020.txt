review/text: I havent found a better knee pad that allows me to practice Tae Kwon Do as comfortable as I do with this one, the others either slip down with the sweat, they open up, or they just dont let me have free movement in the legs as I need and still provide me with excellent support for my knees. So, this is just way better than any other knee pads Ive tried, believe me, ive tried a lot. You are getting an excellent product here, hope it works for you as much as it has for me.
