review/text: I was shocked by how well the 9400 cleaned my teeth. The battery life is longer than expected. I use it for the 2 minutes every morning and night and the battery lasts over two weeks before it dies. The battery indicator shows one bar but mine will last a week on that one bar and run at full power. The 9400 also comes with a great travel case.
