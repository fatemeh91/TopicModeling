review/text: I have had three children and after each pregnancy, I got sicker and sicker with digestive 'issues' AFTER baby is about 2 months old! A friend suggested trying Multidophilus 12 and it has made a huge difference. I still have occasional stomach ache but my digestive system is working much more efficiently and I will not go without these pills any more.
