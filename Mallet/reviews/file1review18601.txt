review/text: I bought this product to increase the amount of protein in my diet. I liked the fact that it does not contain creatine. I don't use a lot, typically one scoop per day on average. Even though I do regular resistance training, I have not noticed any change in muscle mass. I mix one scoop of isolate in 8 oz of fat free milk. I shake it up in a bottle and it blends in well without lumps. The flavor is pretty good, although it is oversweet for my taste. At my low rate of useage I have not noticed any side effects concerning gas or constipation.
