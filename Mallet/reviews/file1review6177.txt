review/text: My son was 14 when he took this and it seemed to help him a lot w/out all the chemical side effects he had experienced with the prescription drugs. I would recommend this as a natural alternative for MILD ADHD cases. Please allow 30-60 days to see full effect! * Your questions or concerns can be found at the Irwin Labs website!
