review/text: If I could buy some fancy recycled yoga equipment I would! But this will do for now.. I just got mine yesterday and its a lot nicer than what I expected. And the bag is also better than expected. I have no clue why people say what they do about the bag. I don't know what they are expecting for twenty bucks!The yoga box did scare me because it only has pictures of women! I was scarred the blocks would not be able to hold me, but they seem sturdy. (I am an athletic 200 lbs.) If I have any trouble with the equipment you can bet I will come back to my computer and say so.
