review/text: I bought Gaia herbal astragalus supreme after reading about some research showing that astragalus extract may help repair telomeres (in DNA strands in our cells). If that's accurate, we might live significantly longer by taking it.So far I haven't really noticed a difference. But I take a lot of supplements, so it's hard to be sure. It could be having an effect without my knowing it. Also, I've been taking only one or two caps a day.... the directions say to take four. So that may be why I haven't noticed much happening yet.One person wrote a review saying the caps were only half full of liquid. The ones I'm taking are about 3/4ths full. I'm not sure if that's good or bad really. (Were they totally full when packaged? Is this really an issue?) I haven't run into any negative effects at all, just uncertain there is any effect.Anyway, I like the idea of taking astrgalus, and I like Gaia's approach go herbal supplements. I'm giving it four stars based on wishful thinking.If I end up living forever, I'll post another review :)
