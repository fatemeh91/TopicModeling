review/text: I started taking prenatal vitamins just because I'm not on any birth control and so if I was to get pregnant I wanted to already have all of the necessary vitamins and minerals on board. After much research and comparing 100's of different prenatal vitamins I chose these because they are once a day and all natural(and had great reviews). I also have not experienced any nausea from them, although I do take them with food or soy milk. I will be buying more when these run out!
