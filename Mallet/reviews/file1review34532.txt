review/text: I recently purchased this item because of the previous reviews and the fact it was suppose to be downloadable to a PC. In fact, after purchasing it I found it came with neither software nor cable. Lumiscope's website, copyright 2001, claims Fox International is the vendor of parts and accessories for Lumiscope products. Fox International does have a Lumiscope product webpage claiming "No products available at this time...". The page was copyrighted in 2005. After contacting the customer service departments from both companies, I was given excuses of software not being available now or in any immediate future and the same for the cables. From my personal experience, this is not "brain surgery" level programming. While the 1134 has potential, if you are looking for computer interface capability, go elsewhere. Personally, without this capability, you can probably get just about all else from a less expensive meter. It would have been far better if the manufacturer had been honest to begin with instead of engaging in bait and switch. None of the Lumiscope product line are currently PC capable or have any identifiable data cable.
