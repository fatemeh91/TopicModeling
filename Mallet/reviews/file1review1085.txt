review/text: I developed tennis elbow a couple of months ago from excessive guitar playing. Even though I stayed away from my guitar for a month (sob, sob), my elbow just wasn't healing. I wore this for a few days straight (daytime only), and my elbow pain decreased significantly. The band is easy to use and comfortable to wear. I'm sure there are other bands that do the same thing just as well, but this one is reasonably priced. I imagine that once my elbow heals completely (I hope), I'll be doing strengthening exercises and wearing this thing every time I play guitar.
