review/text: So 5 years ago I was 18 and needed to drop like 10 pounds to fit in my prom dress. With using zantrex3 and eating lighter, I was about to do that in 2 weeks. ( Keep in mind i also played sports year round) It did make me feel a little jittery but that wore off in about 10 minutes of taking it. Now 5 years later as I got older and my metabolism slowed down, and also becoming less active, I put on about 35 pounds And READ THE BOTTLE IT SAYS DO NOT TAKE MORE THAN 6 PILLS IN 24 HOURS. I need to drop about 35 pounds by the end of June because I'm in my friends wedding. I've been taking zantrex again for 2 days and it gives me the energy to run in the morning before work. I know it'll work cause its worked for me before.
