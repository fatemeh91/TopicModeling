review/text: Caramel Toffee Fudge is a bad flavor. Its smell and taste is almost nauseating. It's very sweet, too sweet I think, but also carries a bitter taste with it. Plus, you don't get as many servings, i.e., the protein percentage is a bit lower than with some of the other flavors.I really like this protein product, but not in this flavor. The only other flavor I've had is the Double Rich Chocolate and I like that one. Decent flavor, not too sweet, and no strange flavors like the caramel one. It mixes better than the Caramel Toffee Fudge. It also has a couple more servings.
