review/text: I had an older Waterpik and it stopped working. I purchased this model even though it did not do quite as much as the top model but it was, and is perfect for my use. I have dentures, top and bottom. I use this device to clean my dentures well and clean and refresh my mouth and gums. You won't believe the great fresh feeling it gives the entire mouth.
