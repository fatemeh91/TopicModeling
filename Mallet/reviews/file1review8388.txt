review/text: The VP family purchased this brush initially to clean water bottles, but quickly discovered it also will clean the inside of our glass Chemex and the bottom of our hand wash Thermos as well. The bristles have never absorbed any odors from coffee or tea and the brush does an excellent job reaching the bottom of a 8 cup Chemex. We use organic soaps, but we do not put this brush in the dishwasher. It dries quickly and stores in our silverware drawer.
