review/text: Pros: Stays warm longer than others I've tried, feels comfortable on your face. It's well constructed, like that it has a removable, washable cover.Cons: It's stiff so it sits on the boney structure surrounding the eye balls which may be OK as a sinus mask, but doesn't work for me as I'm using it for dry eye syndrome. The elastic band around the head is rather stiff . . . could be made of a softer material to make it more comfortable. The elastic head band is attached to the washable cover, which means it'll get worn out faster that if the cover could be removed from the mask.
