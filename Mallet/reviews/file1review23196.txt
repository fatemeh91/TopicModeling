review/text: I have used sweepers like this in the past with decent results, but this unit does not seem to work as well as I had hoped. We purchased it in the hopes of using it in between vacuums. My daughter's room always gets little bits of debris all over it, and I thought something like this would help her keep it clean without dragging the large vacuum all the way upstairs. Like other reviewers I had the issue of the handle falling apart occasionally, but the big issue is that when someone is carrying it around it seems to leave a trail of debris behind it, especially when it is bumped into something like a wall. It also seems to take forever to actually pick something up. Using it is an exercise in frustration because it seems like it would be quicker to just get down and pick it up by hand. Just when you think you got that piece you were going for it dumps it off again about 3 feet away, and you get to start all over again trying to pick it up. I still haven't found a perfect solution for cleaning my daughter's floor, but I can tell you that this unit is not it. We have four cats and four birds so a lot of what we are picking up is fur and feathers, though my daughter's room seems to always have bits of paper on the floor. It does not seem to pick up any of these up well.
