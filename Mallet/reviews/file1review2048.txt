review/text: My feet are size 6 and I have the small ones with me. I've just received the product today and have had it on for quite some time, like more than an hour. Well the instructions did say to put it on for at max 30 minutes initially but it's really comfortable on me. So far I've no pain problems with it. They don't exactly straighten my big toes back to its original state but they help brace them to a better and more comfortable position. If there's one thing I don't like it would be the way they space my big toes far off from my other toes. But for a price like this I'm really happy with it. Getting a bunion splint isn't exactly cheap nor fairly available here in my country and buying it here is like a steal!
