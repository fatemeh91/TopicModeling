review/text: Been using this for 3 years. Remember, this is protein isolates, so bear that in mind in terms of when you take it and such. Helps me get adequate protein intake each day. Athletes often under (or over) estimate their protein needs. I put it in a funnel to go into a water bottle. Add water, shake, and it's good. No need for filters/strainers to remove clumps. I can basically shake it out.However, if you are looking to mix it by hand in a cup or glass, you'll get more clumping, in which case you should use a spoon or fork to mash them out, as the clumps are actually dry balls of the power that have been surrounded by the wetness of the water. It also takes a little longer for it to be ready if you do this method.I take a scoop in the morning and bring the bottle with me out the door so it's very convenient to make.Don't really taste the mintiness much, but it's better than just straight chocolate which I've also tried, so there's at least some difference.
