review/text: To get the nutritional content of these ingredient with dietary arrangements would be very difficult. To those that wouyld complain about the taste -- what do you expect from something that is so good for you. Besides, enough bananas blended in can make anything taste good. I also recommend using Boathouse Farms "Green Goodness" (most supermarkets have it) mixed in to dampen the taste.
