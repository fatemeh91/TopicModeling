review/text: I had purchased almost all Energizer AA Ni-MH batteries and about 8 Duracell AA Ni-MH batteries. What a difference.Duracell: Can charge, store for weeks and then use with confidenceEnergizer: Can charge, but better use right awayDuracell: Can get about 200 pictures on a single set of AA Ni-MHEnergizer: Can get no more than 10 pictures on a single set of AA Ni-MH batteries.It became obvious that Energizer batteries were not up to task, so I recently returned the Energizers and purchased more Duracells. Word of caution on returning batteries to Energizer: They claim to give you compensation for their defective products - unfortunately it is in terms of $10 coupons rather than cash reimbursement. Now I have $70 of useless Energizer battery and flashlight coupons rather than cash. I don't consider Energizer batteries a waste of money - I consider them dangerous. If you are taking a walk and get 5 minutes of life out of a flashlight, that's a problem that I have experienced with Energizer rechargeables. With Duracells I can take several walks before recharging.
