review/text: In a league that cannot compare to the wonders ofOscillococcinum, Gaia Herbs are a good alternative supplement.Although we did not notice a significant state change post consumption, there are many beneficial chemicals in this product that would prove useful to aid in health. However, note that one's emotional state, in addition to physical or primary influences may affect the results of "any" pill.
