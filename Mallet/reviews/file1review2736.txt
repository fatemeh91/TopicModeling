review/text: This was my initial Beanpod candle purchase. The mixed reviews caused me concern, but the positive ones swayed my decision to purchase this expensive candle.I ordered the Honeysuckle scented candle. When it arrived I was immediately concerned as there was no fragrance surrounding it even though it was 75 degrees Fahrenheit.The scent of this candle is a cross between dog urine and cat urine - not ANYWHERE NEAR the sweet nectar scent of honeysuckle!Planned 'obsolescence' is built into these candles as the wax remains circumferentially 1/2-inch on the glass. It does not melt. I will not order any Beanpod items again. I am VERY disappointed in this purchase. I agree with another reviewer, the Beanpod candles smell gross. The candles are pricey and the scent is horrid. I too burned the candle for hours thinking that the wax on the sides would melt and that maybe as it went deeper into the candle that the scent would improve, but it did not improve.
