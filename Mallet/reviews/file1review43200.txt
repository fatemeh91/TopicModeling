review/text: We've been using this product for a couple of years now and really learned to love it. The ylang-ylang scent took us a while to get used to, but once we did we really liked it. (It's a strong scent and it reminded me of a spa we used to go to that used a lot of evergreen scents all around - a nice smell once you get used to it.) Anyway, we got our last shipment of 8 bottles a week or so ago and this new formula stinks - literally. I think it smells like old fish, my husband thinks it smells more industrial, but whatever it is, it's not good. I have to agree with the other reviewers that it also doesn't work as well. We cancelled our automatic shipments and will now look for something else. Bummer. We love method products in general, but the remaining 7 bottles will just go in the recycle bin.
