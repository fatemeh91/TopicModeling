review/text: I have been using this product for years. It keeps my face smoother and I have little to no age spots. I use this along with sun block daily. My 50 year old face looks clean and radiant. Prior to using this I was using another glycolic product, but I wanted a product with more percentage of glycolic acid so I switched to this product. glycolix Elite Facial Cream does not disappoint.
