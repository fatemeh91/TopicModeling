review/text: One of the biggest concerns with protein powder is whether or not it tastes good. I always make protein shakes mixed with some peanut butter and frozen blueberries, and when I do that I would say this tastes great. For the price that I paid, I have been very happy with the product. I will likely make a repeat purchase.
