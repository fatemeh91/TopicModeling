review/text: As other folks have already mentioned, you will not get the Braun 8000 Activator foil package but the Braun 51S, which the replacement.I failed to read the reviews and ordered because I thought I'll get the original 8000 foil, as the add and image showed. To my disapointment, I was sent 51S. The seller refunded my $$$ so all I lost was time dealing with the seller.So if you really want the 8000, don't bother as you will not get it.
