review/text: It's not a rich, creamy milkshake, but it's also only 117 calories per serving. It tastes just fine, mixes well either by manual shaking or blending, and doesn't have much sugars or a whole lot of other extra stuff in it. I have trouble taking pills, and open my own selection of vitamin capsules and blend with this powder to take them. It masks the taste well. If you want a good tasting, low sugar protein powder without a lot of extras, this is an excellent option. I will continue to purchase this product.
