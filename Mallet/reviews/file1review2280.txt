review/text: Come on, didn't you think Gillette was the best a man can get? How can this be the best if it's only 3 blades? Who cares if it has an aloe strip? Schick has 4 blades with its quattro. Then, Gillette one-upped them with a 5-blader.My recommendation is to go with one of the other products with more than 3 blades. More blades, better shave...it's simple math. Come on people, get with the program. These are relics...might as well go to the barber shop and have them shave you with one of those straight razor things.
