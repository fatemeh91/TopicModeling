review/text: Easy to install and works slick. I especially appreciate the ability to record TV data directly into the MPEG format since all of my video capture and editing activities are built around this format. I did get an occasional series of faint diagonal bars in the signal when recording off of a satellite but not off of an over-the-air signal.
