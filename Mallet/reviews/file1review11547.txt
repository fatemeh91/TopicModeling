review/text: I'm a big believer in rechargeable batteries and have purchased many brands. I've never had such bad luck as with Duracel NiMHs. After 2 of the first 4 batteries that I tried wouldn't hold a charge at all, I contacted Duracell, who sent me a replacement pack. I had better luck with the replacements, but I can still count on these to last half the time of any of my other NiMHs. I've tried refreshing these batteries with my La Crosse BC-900, but that didn't improve the discharge rate.After trying a couple packages of Sanyo Eneloops, I'm hooked - that's all I'll be buying in the future!
