review/text: Besides my balsamic kick, I'm kind of on a coconut kick. Purchased a few books stating how good coconut oil is for us. I've been cooking with it which I think actually makes things cook better (tastier). The literature I've read states that coconut supplements are good for you. So, I figured I'd try it. Can't say one way or another if it works. Haven't felt different (good or bad) since taking it. Good news is there is no weird after taste (like you can experience with fish oils).
