review/text: This is a great clipper for the price. It is easy to use, although I do find it a bit heavy to hold for long periods of time. My husband was reluctant to let me cut his hair, but it is very simple to do, and the DVD is helpful. The only minor downfall is that it is difficult to fit everything back into the storage case.
