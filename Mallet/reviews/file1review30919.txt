review/text: I'm worried about this product containing "brown rice syrup". The problem is that rice used to make brown rice syrup is typically grown in regions where arsenic pesticides were heavily used before the EPA banned them in 2009. And while these pesticides are no longer used, their toxic residue is still lurking in the soil where our food is grown. I'd like to know how much arsenic is in this product or would rather it not have brown rice syrup in the product at all. If the amounts are low or none, I'd love to make this a more positive review.
