review/text: I am 28 weeks pregnant. I had back issues for a few years before my pregnancy, and my pregnancy just made it worse. I searched for relief and stumbled upon this.As soon as i opened the package i was being skeptical. But once i put it on i was blown away!!!!! My back had instant relief. It is super comfortable. I can barely feel the cradle! In some of my tops you can see the straps but it is worth it with the relief i am getting.I even recommended this to my pregnant friends on facebook. It's worth it to at least try it.
