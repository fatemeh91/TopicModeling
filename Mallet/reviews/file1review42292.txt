review/text: I was using the whole foods source of life powder. I was looking for more convenience and this is it. The taste isn't terrible but don't expect it to taste like fruit punch. I mix it with a vanilla protein powder to supercharge my protein shakes. I feel better, maybe because I drink less coffee. I'm more awake and don't need the coffee. I feel like I have more sustained energy throughout the day.The bottle is a little hard to squeeze so you might consider peeling off the no spill top under the cover.
