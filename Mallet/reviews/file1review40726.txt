review/text: I have to give this lotion five stars because it's the only body lotion that I've found is gentle enough to also use on my face and neck. I put it on at night and after showers, and it's kept my skin in great shape (no breaking out like I usually do from other body lotions). It's light but still moisturizing, and isn't like other body lotions that are heavy with scent or feel too thick to slather on your cheeks. This is my go-to lotion for everywhere: the gaps between your toes, behind your ears, and your elbows. It'll moisturize everything just the right amount.Be warned: there is a scent! It's not too strong, but if you prefer hypoallergenic lotions, this may not be for you.When I say it moisturizes everywhere, I mean to say it's a daily moisturizer. Don't expect this to heal your puffy eyes or hydrate your chapped winter skin.
