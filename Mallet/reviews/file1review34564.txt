review/text: Followed the directions carefully for quite a long time. They are a bit large to have to take 3 at once. But the real issue is that they did nothing for me. No notable change in any aspect of my body. I expected to at least feel a little perkier and maybe have my nails grow better. But&#8230;nothing. Why bother?
