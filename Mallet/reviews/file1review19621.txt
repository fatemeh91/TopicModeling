review/text: This is by far the best potty seat we have tried. It costs more than most other seats, but it is worth every penny. It really does adjust to any size toilet seat and it does not budge once you have it adjusted properly, which is very easy to do. My 3 year old son can put the seat on and take it off himself. We love it!
