review/text: I had tried everything I could think of to get rid of the ugly, black mildew stains on the grout and caulk where my bathtub meets the tiles in my bathroom, but nothing - not even soaking with straight bleach - made a difference. I sprayed Instagone on the stains, and they were completely gone in less than 10 minutes. It worked exactly as advertised, my tub looks like new, and I couldn't be happier with this product!
