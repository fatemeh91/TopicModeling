review/text: This is a comfortable sleep mask that keeps out the light, and I usually sleep through the middle of the day. The only downside is that a LITTLE light gets in around the nose (not enough to see through eyelids) and it sits a little snugly on the nose. I imagine that could be solved with trimming the fabric, since noses have different shapes and all.
