review/text: I just bought the Bissell Quicksteamer which came with a trial size of this. My carpet has not been deep cleaned for at least 3 years. The first time I used this, I followed the manufacturer's instruction on dilution and did not notice my carpet was visibly cleaner afterwards. The water it extracted was dirty though so it obviously got some of the soil out. The carpet also dried quickly, within an hour as opposed to the 4 hours it said on the manual. Although not VISIBLY cleaner, my carpet did feel softer and fluffier compared to the areas I have not cleaned yet. Excited to see if a second cleaning would show an obvious improvement, I cleaned a 2nd time and used more concentrated solution this time. Nope. Didn't look any cleaner. I dont know if it is my machine or the solution. I am looking at trying a different brand of solution. I will probably try on of those oxy ones. So far, the jury is still out on this product.
