review/text: These bed protectors are fantastic!! I ordered them for my kids' beds, as neither of them are fully night time dry yet. I got four of them, so I had some to 'wear' while the others were in the wash. This is probably the smartest purchase I have made all year. Goodbye disposable nighttime underpants! The purchase price for 4 of these was recouped in about 6 weeks - I wish I would have found them about 4 years ago.
