review/text: There are certainly lots of other eye drops that are less expensive than the Similasan dry eye relief drops, but if you have sensitive eyes like me, and have tried all the others without much success, then these drops may just be the answer. Other drops would actually irritate my eyes if used too frequently. I also have regular problems with dry eye sensations when I sleep, and I could not get accustomed to the thicker nighttime drops that are often recommended. The Similasan drops helped to control my dry eyes after long days in sun, and before bed. I bought them after reading other reviews and am so glad I gave them a try. Awesome product. I just hope they never stop selling it!
