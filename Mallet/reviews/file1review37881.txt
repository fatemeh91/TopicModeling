review/text: I don't go through the hassle of dissolving them... maybe I should but I didn't realize I was supposed too... my son just picks them up out of the palm of my hand and eats one by one... and it works perfect just like that... but he is 18 months and has 16 of his 20 teeth. So maybe dissolving them for younger baby would be necessary... I would say if your child can gum/chew things that one at time is fine.My son usually eats 3 tablets and he just loves them.... 90% of the time within 20 mins my sweet natured little boy is back. I rarely have to resort to tylenol.... however sometimes with Molars the pain is more than he can take and I do.If your looking for a replacement for Hylands, these work just the same if you ask me.... however I am sure each kid is different. I did read some reviews on Hylands other product the Chamomilla and some reviewers said they actually liked that product better than the teething one Hylands had.
