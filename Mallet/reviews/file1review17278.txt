review/text: No, this trimmer isn't the best trimmer in the world. But for around $15, this trimmer does a really good job! I mostly use it to trim my entire face to get my beard short enough that I can use my electric foil shaver on it.However, it also does a decent job of shortening hair too. It's designed very well. You just move a wheel up and down to adjust the guard.I wasn't expecting the trimmer to be this good for so cheap, but it has exceeded my expectation. I highly recommend it.
