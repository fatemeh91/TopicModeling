review/text: This system is better than shaving, since instead of cutting the hair it pulls it out completely. The hair then takes longer to regrow and over time will grow back thinner. I have to admit, the first couple of times it does hurt (it's almost like waxing), but you get used to it and the pain goes away. I'm not sure if I would use this on my bikini area, but it works great on legs. This is a great product if you're looking for a way to keep your legs free of hair longer and is cheaper than getting a wax.
