review/text: Basically, I used this as an energy pill when working out. Within two months I lost 30 pounds. Worked out a lot and semi cut back on bad foods & proportions. Using only 1 pill during main workouts & drank lots of water. 1 pill was enough for me since I don't intake much caffeine. Make sure to take them at least 5 hours before bed, or you will have problems falling asleep. Within the next 2 months lost an extra 10 pounds (extremely, cut back on using the pill, working out and eating healthy.. Holiday season)! If I would have kept it up, I believe I would have lost 50 pounds or more altogether during the 4 months. Probably would have lost more if I followed the directions of taking 2 pills before main meals. Although, I would have been bouncing off the walls from too much energy and defiantly would have had issues falling asleep.
