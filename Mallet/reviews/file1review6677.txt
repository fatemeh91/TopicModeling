review/text: I can't say enough good things about this product. After several years of physical therapy, pain reliever and muscle relaxers I'm finally pain free. I purchased this along with &#34;The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook: Your Self-Treatment Guid for Pain ...&#34; by Clair Davies. I am now pain free after many chiropractic, therapy, massage and medical doctor visits. Read the information carefully, purchase a book to use with the Back Buddy and have patience. If you place on a spot that is tender and very painful know you have hit the jackpot. With a couple days of gentle pressure you will be pain free. I can't say enough about this product.
