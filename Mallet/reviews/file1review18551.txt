review/text: I had one of these for over 25 years and it finally fell apart. I despaired at not having my "pacifier" which I used for low back muscle spams. My darling husband found this one for me online and I'm back in business! Just 15 minutes or so heating in a pot of water on the stove, this pad brings such soothing relief and comfort. I wrap it in a towel and apply it to the affected area for 20 minutes.It is easily stored after cooling and I always know where it is...for future use.
