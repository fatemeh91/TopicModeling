review/text: After heart surgery I've decided to let my beard grow and this trimmer works great. I was concerned about getting trimmed too closely and perhaps getting nicked. Taking blood thinners can make getting nicked a real problem so was delighted that this trimmer allows us amateurs to work well and safely. Another triumph for Amazon!
