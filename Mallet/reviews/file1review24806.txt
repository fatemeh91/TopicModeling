review/text: The item shown is not what is sent. There is some kind of product name SNAFU because the item shipped is a strap-on harness not the bed bondage strap shown. Apparently, both products have the same name. I returned the incorrect items. Waiting to see what shows up in return. Obviously, if time is an issue, you may want to spend the couple of extra dollars and buy this product elsewhere until they get this thing straightened out.
