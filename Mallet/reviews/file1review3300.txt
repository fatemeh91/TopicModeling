review/text: My mother asked if I could pick up a new pair of tweezers for her - the pair she has had for over 40 years went missing. I had these delivered to her and she called to tell me they had arrived and that they were awesome. She said she had never seen a pair of tweezers so precise like these and was no longer mourning the loss of her old tweezers. She was used to the older style with scissor type loop/handles and wasn't sure how she would do with these with her arthritis, but she said they do a great job and they're easy for her to hold.
