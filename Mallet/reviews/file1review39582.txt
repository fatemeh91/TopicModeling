review/text: A little bit goes a long way with this product. I like the rust-resistant bottom, but I learned to keep all shaving gels up on top to not leave a rust ring. I'm not really fond of the smell though. My legs are always dry after I shave them, and they still were after using this product. I liked the gel much better than foam. I didn't see any different one way or another from any of the other shaving gels that I've tried, though.
