review/text: I remembered this scent from college 16 years ago, and couldn't find it. I tried every Amber oil I found and it just wasn't the same. When I ordered this, I had already lost hope, but this was it! It's very warm and spicy with no astringent or acidic smells. Beautiful! Be warned, the consistency is very thick. It's more sticky than other oils. It's very strong, so use sparingly.
