review/text: I have shelled out for three different varieties of orthotics. Don't bother. For under ten percent of the charges for the orthotics I got this tool, stretched out my plantar and Achilles, and am now a heck of a lot better, at a much better price and with out the bother of messing around with my shoes. My Podiatrist's Warning: keep on stretching. A two week sabbatical from stretching and, if you are like me, you will likely be back in the original painful condition.
