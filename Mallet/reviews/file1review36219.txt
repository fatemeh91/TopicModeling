review/text: I bought this to replace my old non-professionl quality clippers. These are far superior. They cut perfectly, quickly and the edges of the hair are cut cleanly. The cut hair feels much softer compared to my old clippers which I've been using for about twenty years. They are a bit heavier than my old plastic clippers, but create much less vibration. Equally good for head and body hair.
