review/text: We had a leak in our camper roof around our antenna. Unfortunately we let it go for awhile before repairing it. Because of this the area of staining (black mildew / mold) was fairly extensive. We had a carpet cleaner that does RVs try to remove the staining. His method did very little other than fade the stain slightly. I read about Instagone on the internet and purchased it. As I sprayed it on the stain it began to disappear! We were very impressed especially since a professional was unable to remove the stains. Almost immediately but definitely by the next day the stains were gone. There was only one small area right around the antenna that the stain wasn't completely removed. This stain had been there for about 1yr so I was extremely pleased. Our ceiling carpet in the camper was cream colored & it did not change the original color. However, some of the spray got on our floor carpet (dark beige) and did bleach it out so that would be my only warning. To be on the safe side, cover any areas that the spray may accidently come in contact with. We were very pleased & give this product 5 out of 5 stars.tmspotts, Blythewood, SC
