review/text: I bought it based on so many great reviews. I wonder if I am the only one who was not able to attach it to the existing toilette seat. The description says "adjusts easily and sits firmly in place"...well, it does not. It slides right out of the existing seat. SO I basically keep in there not attached at all and have to sit my child and remove him from there, otherwise the seat falls out.
