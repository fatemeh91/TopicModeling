review/text: I used the product and found it helped with joint pain as does the other Glucosamine/Chondroitin/MSM products on the market however I am prone to GERD. I couldnt understand why I was getting GERD flare-ups but eventually I suspected the Osteo-Bi Flex with the Boswellia serrata extract was the cause so upon looking into it I found that a common side effect(s) is:One of the most common side effects of Boswellia serrata extract, when it's used at recommended doses, is mild gastrointestinal upset. Discomfort may include nausea, heartburn, stomach pain, a feeling of fullness or diarrhea.The day after I stopped taking the Osteo-Bi Flex with the 5-Loxin (Boswellia serrata extract) the esophageal burning disappeared completely.
