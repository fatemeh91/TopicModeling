review/text: It was louder than I expected, for one. I had another off brand mini massager that I'd had for six months and i loved it. It was quiet and powerful. In fact, someone could walk into the room and not hear it. It broke after ample amounts of use and I finally decided to get the original pocket rocket, which i expected to be better than the off brand.So it is a bit loud, compared to my old one, but it's still a fairly quiet vibrator. People around the house wouldn't hear it, but if they stood outside the door for a few seconds, they could probably notice some sound. The metal nubs aren't pronounced enough for me so i prefer the cap, which doesn't hurt even though the plastic points look slightly intimidating. It has a pretty good battery life and does its job, though really, you're not purchasing an EXTREMELY powerful vibrator. Really I'm biased because I'm comparing it to the hitachi magic wand, which is incredible. Next to that, the pocket rocket is impotent. But if I wait a couple days without using the hitachi, the pocket rocket works just fine, and it's a LOT quieter than the hitachi for sure.Overall, it was a good purchase for the money. It's portable, discrete, and powerful for its size.
