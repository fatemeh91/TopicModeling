review/text: I have a dog and a cat and a small area rug, and it just felt so wasteful each time i took out the Dyson, so i decided to give this little sweeper a try. Had it for over 4 months now, and it still works great. Both my cat and dog don't shed a lot, and whatever hair they do shed is picked up by Sweeper just fine. For smaller pieces of crumbs, i sometimes have to run it over several times, but it takes just a few extra seconds for that, so i am still happy with Sweeper (and no longer feel bad about plugging in the Dyson for such a small job). I keep Sweeper near the rug, so it doesn't get moved around much, and the handle has NOT fallen out on me as I used it.
