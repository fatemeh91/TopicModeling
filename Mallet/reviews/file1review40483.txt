review/text: I first started wet-shaving when I was 13. I always used the canned shaving cream, like barbasol or gillette, but hated the fact that it made my skin feel so slick and caused me to break out sometimes. And then there is the smell. If I want to put deodorant on my face I will do just that. Taylor of old bond street solved all of those problems. The cream itself works into a great lather and the scents available are wonderful. And considering each jar lasts me about 6 months, the cost is about the same as those canned creams in the long run. If you've never tried it, do so now. If you have, why are you reading this?
