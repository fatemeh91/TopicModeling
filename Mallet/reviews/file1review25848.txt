review/text: This is a very good shaver - except that it suddenly stops working, even when I follow the owner's manual religiously. I bought my first one last fall, and after about 3 months, it stopped taking a charge. The replacement lasted about 2 months before the same thing happened. Now my current replacement shaver (#3) just quit on me with no notice, so I'll have to call Panasonic again to get my FOURTH shaver in about 8 months. If this happened once, maybe twice, I'd chalk it up to bad luck. But FOUR defective shavers? ...so I figure this has a design flaw or poor quality control. By the way, my previous older model Panasonic wet-dry shaver worked just fine for over 2 years... DON'T BUY THIS SHAVER!!!
