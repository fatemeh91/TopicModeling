review/text: My dishwasher was making a funny grinding noise and I called Sears appliance repair. The tech said I could either replace a part in the dishwasher's "garbage disposal" (apparently there is a mini garbage disposal inside that grinds up food before it goes into the drain) or let it be and see if it gets worse. Since there was no harm in waiting I did. He suggested Dishwasher Magic and I ordered 4 bottles. The price seemed kind of high, but two bottles stopped the problem. We have very hard (mineral rich) water here, and the inside of the dishwasher was covered with white film in spite of being only 2 years old. Dishwasher Magic removed the scales. I now have this as part of my regular maintenance. The product is simple to use.
