review/text: Oxy Powder works exactly how I thought it would. I took 4 pills and only went once the next day, so I increased my dose up to 5 pills per night and I was good to "go." I probably went on average 5-7 times per day. I never felt like I was rushed to find a bathroom and I never had the stomach pains I've had with other cleanse products either. After I finished my 7 day round, I felt great...much less bloated and had more energy. I would definitely recommend this product.
