review/text: I used this item for one month. It was pricey, and I thought "I can make this from the herbs listed on the bottle for less than they charge!* I was wrong. I don't know what herb I am missing, but I am missing something.This is the first and ONLY herbal suppliment (After 13 years of Vitex, Red clover, Saw Palmetto, etc) that did a thing.And it did.I won't get into details, but I have the most severe case of PCOS any specialist has seen. Their words, not mine.I recently had a 70lb ovarian tumor removed for example.If this worked even A LITTLE on ME, it could actually work for you.If you are willing to shell out the cash for it.I only give it 4 stars due to the fact that I wasn't "fertile" that I am aware of.
