review/text: If you're dealing with morning sickness and can barely brush your tongue without almost throwing up, you will have a hard time with these pills. I am on Amazon looking for a pill cutter now. Considering the natural nature of these pills, I pray that that won't somehow make them too effective or not effective enough. That said, my bff told me I had to take these. Besides all of the great stuff for fetus, she said that they kept every hair in her head post-partum. She is no longer pregnant but continues to take them daily.UPDATE:I actually returned these and got the same brand but they're called the Petite version. I am so guilt free now. I get to take 3 reasonably sized tablets and get all of the same good stuff.
