review/text: This is a great little sweeper for me. I don't expect it to be a miracle cleaner and work for everything, that's why I'm very happy with it. It does what it was designed to do - sweep up bits of stuff from low pile carpet, esp. commercial carpet. I have a habit of not wanting to clean anything until it's late at night, but I can't exactly roll out the vacuum at 2am. So this guy is great for sweeping up the area rugs in my apartment whenever I feel like doing it. I have two short-hair cats and I'm always really surprised at the amount of fur I pick up with this thing! It's really satisfying to see all of that in the compartments before it gets dumped into the trash. I also am responsible for vacuuming the commercial carpet in my building's hallways and this sweeper was really convenient to use in between vacuuming, especially in the fall when people kept tracking leaves inside.
