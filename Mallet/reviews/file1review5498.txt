review/text: AMBU CPR has a great product here. This mask is one of the cheapest on the market, has a replacable valve with filter, and is made from quality materials! It is a complete saftey kit, gloves and wipes included in a bright red, hard, crush resistant case. I have recommended this to the American Heart Association CPR instructers in my area. These masks are much easier for beginners to use than faceshields and the disposable plastic liner types. I noticed many people struggling to get a good mouth seal with other cpr shields, they tend to move around while doing compressions, dont get me wrong all cpr devices are a good thing, but this one is at the top of the line with the laderal units! Thanks AMBU, keep up the good work!!
