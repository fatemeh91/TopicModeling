review/text: I have been buying these gloves routinely for years - I work as a consultant for automotive dealerships and wear them while inspecting service departments and body shops. They are more durable than others I have tried, easily last for a couple of hours, and give me the confidence that I am keeping nasty chemicals off my hands (check your Material Safety Data Sheets to ensure you are selecting the right gloves for the job!). Occasionally, I can even get them off and on again for re-use, albeit it can be a little tricky. The purplish color is a bit odd, but since I'm a girl I can get away with it. :)Since most of my glove-wearing constitutes picking up a chemical bottle and examining it or digging a not-quite-empty paint can out of the trash, I haven't put them through constant rigorous work. I do, however, wear them for personal automotive maintenance jobs (e.g. oil changes, coolant flushes) and they hold up well through these tasks. One pair has always lasted the entire job.In my opinion, gloves are a personal choice, and you should keep trying until you find ones you like. Since I work around automotive technicians every day, I can verify that no one brand of glove will make everyone happy. This brand makes me happy!
