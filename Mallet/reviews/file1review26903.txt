review/text: I've seen some mixed reviews on the taste of this flavor, but I find it quite good, reminiscent of darker chocolate rather than the super sweet stuff like a regular hershey's bar.This whey mixes well (as I'd expect from ON) with no clumping, no hint of harsh aftertaste.It's a little more expensive than whey you might get at a local big-box store, it's true, but a premium for mixability, a great selection of flavors, and a solid nutritional profile is worth it.
