review/text: I have waxed all my life and being a mother of 4, it is very time consuming and a headache to have to wait for the hair to grow before I wax! I tried Emjoi optima because a friend told me she doesn't wax anymore. what she forgot to tell me was that I don't have to wait for the hair to get to a certain length! I tried Emjoi two days after I had shaved and I had tiny hairs starting to regrow and I was amazed at how quickly and efficiently this thing pulled the hair from underneath the skin! i am in love with it and am noticing I am wearing shorts and skirts more often because I don't have to wait!! the whole process of touch up takes about 10 minutes and presto. done. I don't feel pain because of years of waxing. I tried under arms and the pain was tolerable although I have been shaving it. I don't think I have ever left such a long and thorough review for anything before. If you are hesitating you should give it a try. I love this little machine. life is easier, good bye nasty wax lady!
