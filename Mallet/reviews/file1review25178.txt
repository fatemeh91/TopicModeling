review/text: Over 20 years ago, I accepted a trade for a Braun 2520 razor with a pair of Timberland boat shoes that I had bought for $25 dollars... but the razor had a busted foil! For years I planned to buy a replacement for it, but never found the time... I was going to Sweden, so said to myself that since it had a switch to 220v, this razor would be perfect to fix finally. This was a perfect replacement, razor looks like brand new... too bad it doesn't cut coarse hair worth a flip! Ah well, live and learn.
