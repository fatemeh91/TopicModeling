review/text: In the past, I've used a needle for ingrown hairs or regular tweezers. I thought these tweezers would work better but they don't. These are actually less effective and cause more damage. Because of their thickness, it rips the skin around the hair which can cause scarring more so than a needle and regular tweezers. It's basically like using a thin nail to dig the hair out or at least that's what it felt like using them. These were a complete waste of time and money for me and added nothing to the process of digging out an ingrown hair.
