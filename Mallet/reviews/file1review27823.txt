review/text: The Optimum Standard Whey Protein definitely lived up to my expectations for quick whey protein. The taste is great, it actually does taste like French Vanilla Creme when you mix it with skim milk, and mixing it into a smoothie gives a wonderful sweet taste. I make a very simply smoothie from a banana, some vanilla extract, skim milk, and ice, and to me this protein complements it quite well. I will note that when mixing just with milk it clumps a little initially so it'll take some good shaking to get it well mixed if you're making the effort yourself. Overall I wasn't disappointed with this is protein powder and would recommend it to anyone who likes the vanilla flavor.
