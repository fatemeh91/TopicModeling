review/text: So I hesitated to buy this, because my grandma always has one of these in her house and it SUCKS. But my sticky roller was ruining my husband's expensive suits (they were starting to pill!! horrors!) so I thought I would give this a try, especially since it's much more ecological. Ummmm it works AMAZINGLY! Hindsight is 20/20 and I realize now that my grandma's lint brush like this is probably 20 years old, because she's really cheap. These must wear out after a few years. But yeah, I will totally pay five bucks to get a new one every now and then.The one thing it doesn't work on is loosely knit fabrics. So don't plan on using it on your cashmere sweaters. But for everything else (suits, jeans, tees, shirts, etc.) it's soooo useful.
