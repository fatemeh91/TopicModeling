review/text: This is the third Panasonic eletric razor I've owned. The 1st one broke when I put it in my checked luggage on a 2 hr flight. It got a little shook up I suppose and no longer would charge. The second one I had worked for about a month, and after being charged twice, would no longer hold a charge. The third one I bought just died yesterday. Had it about 3 months, charged it for the second time, and it's no longer holding a charge. I've owned other brands of razors and never had a problem with them holding charges, so I've wasted enough money on these Panasonics.
