review/text: Miracle Rash Repair is one of the best over the counter healing agent for dry skin and other skin irritations I have ever used. How ever the price has doubled since my last purchase. The first tube I bought was approx. six dollars the last tube almost twelve dollars. The prescription salve I used was more effective but it was a steroid. I would recommend trying Miracle Rash Repair for skin problems It has worked for me.
