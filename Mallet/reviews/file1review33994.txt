review/text: I have suffered with eczema all my life and normally use Eucerin right after my bath for maintenance. For flare ups, I usually use hydrocortisone mixed in with Eucerin, but now, I just apply the Psorzema Creme a couple of times and the flare up is gone!I also have been using it for my baby girl since she was 4 weeks old. I love the fact that it is all natural and steriod free! Another mother recommended this product, and I'm SO thankful she did! Our pedi told us it was baby acne at first, but then it got a lot worse...flaky, dry, red, and irritated. At first I mixed it with the hydrocortisone to relieve it quickly to prevent infection, and after 1 application of the mixture, it was gone! Since then, I only apply it after her bath, and it's never come back! She's now almost 4 months!I was a little skeptical at first, esp. with the price. The 4oz jar lasts awhile though...a little bit really goes a long way, so don't let the price deter you from purchasing. It lasted us almost 3 months! I would definitely recommend this product and give it a try!
