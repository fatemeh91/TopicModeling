review/text: I wish I had known about this 30 years ago when I could have benefitted more from it. I would have more "tooth enamal" left, but even at this point, it really helps keep me from distroying my teeth. Since I can't get rid of the tension in my life, this really helps. Very comfortable, and the company that makes it is very easy and generous when I had difficulties earlier.
