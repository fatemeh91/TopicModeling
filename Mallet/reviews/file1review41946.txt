review/text: I love this cream. I use it under my night moisturizer. I used to use the glycolic acid pads once a week. Now I use the cream every day except the day I do my microderm abrasion at home. One piece of advice: when you use glycolic acid, you want to start with a .5 and work up to the 20 percent if you have never used it before and also, don't put it on your eye area.
