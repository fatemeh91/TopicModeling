review/text: I was concerned about my purchase, having read several negative reviews about the product stopping working. I had lost my older Braun electric toothbrush, which I'd had for several years. I liked the specs for the Triumph, and Amazon had a great price. All the reviews were great, except for those who's product stopped working. I purchased one, anyway, and have been delighted. The best cleaning ever! I travel a lot, and it has a nice travel charger and case, and the features all work well and are useful. As long as it does not stop working, I'll be very satisfied. If it does, I'm coming for Braun!
