review/text: I got this scale for two reasons:- Our old scale was too easy to trick. (About 10 pounds depending on how you stood.)- I wanted to watch my fat content.This scale has definitely helped the first point. The scale provides weight acurate to 2/10 of a pound, and seems to be very consistent about it.The fat content on the other hand seems to vary wildly. The scale reports it in 1% increments, however I've seen readings fluctuate by 7%. I have no other way of verifying the fat readings, so it could be telling the truth. But it doesn't seem very consistent.
