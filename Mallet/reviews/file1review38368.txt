review/text: I had to review this product when I saw it on line again. I have owned this since 1990. I bought it to remove hair. BOY DOES IT! I thought it would be a good alternative to shaving. It was the end of shaving for me. I consider myself to have average body hair. That said I am very pale and my hair is very black. I felt like I had a five o'clock shadow at 3. I never expected these results. It hurts....but it's worth it. I also had minor bleeding at the follicle site. I expected the treatment to last 3 weeks. My thighs and bikini and one underarm never came back from the first treatment; scared to death I think! My other underarm came back thin and soft and since lost the battle and decided not to come back either. I think it took 2 years...but I stupidly shaved a few times in between to avoid the pain and leave the house quick. Once I made a rule and stuck to the emjoi it went away completely. My legs from the knee came back for about the same time. I think it was harder to get rid of because of all the superficial blood supply to the skin. Anyways, for the past 20 years or so I only get an occasional straggler hair that I pluck from my leg. Maybe one hair in a 5 inch area?! I love this machine and can't say enough good about it. It's been a wonderful quarter of a century not to have to shave everyday....I only wish I had ordered it before my 28th birthday. Got my eyeliner tatoo(ed) on too. That was also a great but painful choice. I consider myself a low maintenance female(if such an animal exists). Enjoy!
