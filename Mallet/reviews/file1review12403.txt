review/text: This is a great lubricant, THERE IS NO OIL. Yet it performs its functions extremely well. It's pleasant smelling (very subtle), washes off easily, and does NOT stain! The guy who came up with this stuff (no pun intended) did his homework. It really does exactly what it's supposed to do, and it does it very well. I have conducted years and years of "field research" (lol), and tried different products with varying results. This one outperforms all predecessors, uh.... hands down! All joking aside, just try it, you'll not be disappointed.
