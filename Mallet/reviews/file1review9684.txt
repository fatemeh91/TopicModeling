review/text: Very light weight, inexpensive reading glasses. I get migraines easily and am a bit head sensitive so almost all glasses feel too heavy after a half hour or so except these. They are very 1930's Charlie Chan movie-ish so if you like the bookish, retro style they are easily worn and almost weightless.
