review/text: I just got this a couple of weeks ago and so far I love it! I love the smell of it -- it's very much like a fresh "baby oil" smell. Not too powdery like deodorant, though. I haven't used it long enough in the shower, but I can say that it's the only product I used on our new frosted vessel sink that got the calcium-like "rings" off. I haven't tried any harsh products on the sink, but my other environmentally safe/natural counter sprays did nothing to help it.I'm getting a couple of bottles of the Mrs Meyers basil shower cleaner soon, so I'll make a review on that soon.What I can say is that this stuff works just as well as traditional shower cleaner but it's much less chemically smelling and I'm not worried about inhaling it. I'm also not as worried if the cat happens to walk in a damp shower after we've used it.It might cost a little bit more, but if you find one you like and can order in bulk from Amazon, it's really not that big of a difference. :)
