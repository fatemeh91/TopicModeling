review/text: I don't take these but have purchased them for my husband for the past few years, and they work like magic....and because they are natural, made with oil from the peel of an orange, they have NO side affects, which is unheard of when taking any type of a drug. Almost like clock-work, after 6 or 7 months, he starts getting heartburn again, and we start him on another pack, and he is set and comfortable for the next 6 or 7 months. They truly are an amazing, natural remedy for heartburn! Don't waste your time, money and health taking the over-the-counter or prescription heartburn meds, they only make it worst by reducing your body acid, and in return, your body produces more acid. If you suffer from heartburn, you must try these!
