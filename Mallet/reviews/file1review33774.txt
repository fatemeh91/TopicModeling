review/text: I was recommended this product after receiving electrolysis and it works wonders, no matter which are on my body I shave or wax, I can dab this on and I won't have to worry about any razor bumps appearing and any previous bumps I have had disappear in a matter of days. The scent is somewhat of a vinegar/alcohol smell but that quickly fades and is worth the results. I normally uses tend skin before sleep or right after shaving or waxing for its best effect. I have used this on many areas including my face and bikini area. I would greatly recommend for women.
