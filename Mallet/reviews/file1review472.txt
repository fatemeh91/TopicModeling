review/text: i am a male, and i bought it for my self because i am bi.this is my first true toy, i bought a smaller vibrator which in all fairness was ok, it was smaller then this one (i bought the clear/grey one) and its vibration was nice, almost tickling. and i was hoping for something a bit bigger, and maybe with more motion, so i bought this toy.after getting it from the mail i got into the bathroom and put it to use. it was definitely bigger, i feared it wasn't even going to fit lol.but after a few mins working at it it got in and i started messing with the features and it felt pretty good, vibration didn't do anything for me at all,, and the rotation was not very noticeable till i accidentally bent it a little (right under the ball bearings) and now it does BIG rotations which feels incredible. the material is soft but firm at the same time, no lubrication is needed tho maybe wanted if your not used to the size, i personally don't have lube, and i am a little sore from its size and use ^//^. if you do decide to bend it a little to make the rotation better be careful because it Might brake, i don't want to risk it by seeing how far it can be bent.obviously as a male i can only use it in one place, so its not as sensitive as it prob is for most females, but its size and rotation(after being bent) is really good. i wasn't able to finish the first time of use due to stamina, new positions and all but i'm sure in time i will. good toy, only time will tell if its worth the money (i'm a very cheap person xD). as for the noise its really quiet, i had my bathroom fan on but i don't think it really needed it, if u try to push the toy to its max then maybe you need a cover up sound (guilty).i would love to have someone use this on me or me use on them ^//^ but for now i'll just have to work alone. 4star would recommend[...] (i'm 18 years old, USA, FL)
