review/text: I'd already been thinking about giving this kit a try, and was glad to be able to Test Drive it. It had pretty simple instructions and was easy to use. However, if it doesn't turn positive after the first five test sticks, the test instructions say to keep testing with another kit, which could get expensive. I think there should be more test sticks.
