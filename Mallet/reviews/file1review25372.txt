review/text: I am not a pen person. I have been completely happy with the disposable types that come 20 in a package.My wife had one of these pens first and when it ran out of ink, she moved on to her next pen. After searching a couple office supply stores, I found some refills and have been using it daily for the past couple of years.Unfortunately, its greatest feature is also its greatest weakness. Its so small, it fell out of my shirt pocket at some point one day. So I went back to the 20 to a package type pens and couldn't stand them. So I bought a new one.I like the flow of the ink, how dark and clear it comes out on the page and I don't have to bear down on multiple copy forms. The barrel is perfect thickness for me and is extremely comfortable to write for long periods with it. Its very easy to open and close with one hand, but it doesn't pop open while in your pocket. The ink cartridges last a reasonable amount of time. I buy them in bulk online now as they are difficult to find in the office supply stores.Only gave it 4 stars because I don't read the 5 star reviews. They almost all read like something out of a PR/Marketing office.
