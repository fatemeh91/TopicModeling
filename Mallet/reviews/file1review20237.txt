review/text: I find these cloth diapers very useful. I use them as burp cloths and to have handy in case of spills or other baby related messes. They are absorbent and comfortable to use. They are soft, so they don't scratch my babies face when I clean his mouth. I first bought 1 package and then went back for more. They are inexpensive and very useful.
