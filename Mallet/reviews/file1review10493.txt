review/text: The Sonicare toothbrush was recommended to me by my dentist a couple of years ago. She told me it was the best toothbrush I could use, and I definitely think she was right. Like other reviewers have said, the replacement heads are expensive. But costly dental work is MORE expensive! These brush heads are just the right size for the average adult mouth and get my teeth sparkly clean. The health of my gums has improved greatly since using the Sonicare, too. Here's a hint...Purchase these replacement heads under Amazon's subscription plan and you win two ways: You save money and you don't have to worry about ordering. It's all taken care of you automatically by Amazon. :-)
