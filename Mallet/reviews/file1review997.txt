review/text: I am mom who has a 2 month old and a 2 year old. With my first son I had a low milk supply and tried every thing to up my milk supply. I tried Pumping and drinking beer and eating oatmeal, you name it I tried it. I used a whole bottle with my first son and got a second bottle for my second son. It tastes bad but it works!
