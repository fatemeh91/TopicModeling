review/text: I bought this shaver in July, 2007. It gives a great, close shave. The smoothness doesn't last an entire day, but it's far more convenient and less time consuming than using a razor.The battery lasts a long time before it needs charging and the unit is simple to clean.I like that 3 different heads came with the shaver, so I could find the right one for my skin. I recently switched to the 'very close' shave head, but after the 2nd use, the foil tore. I emailed Wahl with the issue and received an IMMEDIATE response. I just received TWO replacement heads yesterday at no cost to me (not even shipping and handling)!In this age where customers are dealing with multiple phone menus and long waits to get a question answered or an issue fixed, this was EXTREMELY refreshing! THANK YOU, WAHL!It's nice to buy a great product AND deal with a great company.
