review/text: I bought this hoping for good things. It worked great for three days and I thought I found THE product. However, by the fourth, I smelled something funky and realized it was me. I thought maybe I didn't put enough on or didn't shake it up enough, so I tried it for another few days. However, I just don't think this product works for me. I would say I smell like body odor masked with floral perfume. I think that it worked for the first few days I used it because I still had my old non-natural deodorant lingering on me.
