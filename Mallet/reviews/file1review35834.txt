review/text: The label on the bottle instructs to take 15 drops directly into mouth twice a day before meals. I did and now roof of my mouth is waxed over plus tongue is black and waxed over. The bad taste is sealed in and I have tried heating water to get rid of the wax but it wouldn't come off. Also other ingredient is ethyl alcohol and I am surely not in favor of using that internally. Maybe if you want to seal off an external wound and don't mind the staining it might be good for that use. But for taking internally, do yourself a great favor and just order the UniFlora Propolis Extract (alcohol free). It doesn't taste good either, but at least you can rinse and swallow the rest of it down quickly. I was trying to save a little money. I have used 2 bottles of the UniFlora brand and it is excellent. Also guess you need to always be sure it says "no wax"!
