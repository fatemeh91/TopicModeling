review/text: This might seem pricey for a toothbrush but it is worth every penny. It has a metal band around the handle which you wet and keep your fingers on (or wet your fingers) This explanation is taken from the ionicbrush.com website :The Ionic toothbrush works on the principle that every element in nature has a positive or negative charge. This is called polarity. When the polarities are opposite, the two elements cling together. That?s why dust sticks to your coffee table and why plaque, which has a positive charge (+), clings stubbornly to your negatively charged (-) teeth.Dyna-Dental's new hyG Ionic Action toothbrush temporarily reverses polarity of the tooth surface from negative (-) to positive (+), drawing plaque towards the negatively charged hyG toothbrush head.When you brush with a hyG toothbrush, a constant flow of positive ions (+) from the lithium power source temporarily reverses your teeth?s polarity. This makes your teeth reject plaque, even in areas that aren?t touched by hyG?s bristles.I know this..I have always been fussy about my teeth. I have a goal of have all my teeth in my head when I die. Hey, you have to have goals! My teeth were white. BUT.. after using this toothbrush they are even whiter! While brushing yellow was on my toothbrush.. what the heck?? From where? I have white teeth. Guess not! I am assuming it was more plague. For the last five years now I have used this toothbrush and there is nothing to clean when I go to the dentist. I go twice a year for a cleaning and they pick around a little and say what a great job I have done.. there isn't really much if anything to clean. Two thumbs up there! And, they say they say can tell I do a great job flossing. (not). If you want to be lazy before falling in bed, and that is a lazy time after all, I just wet the brush and do a quick scrub knowing it still cleans really well without 'all that effort' of opening the toothpaste. I will not live without this toothbrush!!
