review/text: I was diagnosed with PCOS (poly-cystic ovarian syndrome) and have had a wacky cycle for years. I was put on birth control and a bunch of other medicines to help regulate my cycle, but it was all too much. The last medication I tried was Metformin, which did nothing, at the highest dose. I stumbled upon FertilAid for Women while doing some internet research, and decided to give it a try. After taking it for only 2 weeks, my cycle started on its own!!!! I am using it as a cycle regulator, not to get pregnant right off, but still, I highly recommend this to anyone out there with an abnormal cycle!
