review/text: First of all, I love Ecover products, but this is one of my favorites! I discovered this awhile back when I was transitioning my home to all-natural (and still affordable) products. Here's how I use this: When I'm mopping the floor, I just toss a cap full into my bucket of hot water, while I'm filling it, and voila, hot soapy water, that's safe on all surfaces. Add a cap full to an empty spray bottle, add water, and you have all purpose spray bottle cleaner too. I also use that spray bottle for cleaning spills on the carpet and it works great. The other thing I primarily use this for is I'll add a cap full to the toilet bowl when I'm scrubbing it. A couple times I've even poured some into the laundry when I had an extra dirty load of laundry, works great! I love this stuff! I've saved so much money using this product too. I mean, it's a huge bottle, and it goes a long way! I highly recommend!
