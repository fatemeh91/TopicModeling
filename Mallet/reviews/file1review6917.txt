review/text: I just recently got a kidney transplant and I basically don't have an immune system. I started using this when I think I get colds, I just spray it in my mouth. It feels like they instantly go away. I swear by this product now. I was in the hospital for 10 days with about 10 mouth ulcers and the doctors couldn't fix it until I went home and discovered this.I really recommend it to people who get sick easily or want to prevent it.
