review/text: Have been using the electric Oral B toothbrushes for years as my dentist suggested. Just upgraded to the new Oral B Triumph and all I can say is "Wow"! I feel like I just left the dentist office after a cleaning. I now brush longer because of the new timer that tells me ever 30 seconds to move onto another part of my mouth. I didn't think much of this feature just reading about it, but take it for a test drive and see if you don't brush longer. I can't wait for my next cleaning to see what the hygentist says about my teeth and gums. From somebody who hates the dentist and has problem gums, this is the product to help with that. This brush gets everything, it doesn't replace flossing, but it's darn close.
