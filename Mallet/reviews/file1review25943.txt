review/text: This may be a good charger but the deceptive representation of the product overshadowed everything else about it for me. There is a customer image that shows the charger with both a cover and an AC adapter. That is not a picture of this product . In fact, the exact same picture is used to represent the Digipower DPS-5000 1 Hour AA/AAA Rechargeable Battery Kit. How can the same exact picture be used to describe two different products? Amazon should correct the obvious problem created when someone either knowingly or unknowingly uploads a photo that misrepresents a product. It would save the trouble of customers' having to return the product and the cost of Amazon's dealing with returned open packages (I couldn't be sure of the lack of the above two items without opening the package). I guess, if you know about the false photo and like the charger, it could get a higher rating. This review mainly is about the false "packaging" by Amazon. The features that the product was misrepresented as possessing (through the photo) were exactly those that I was looking for.
