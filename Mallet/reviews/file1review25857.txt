review/text: After my last Panasonic died after a recent trip to China where I am quite sure a voltage surge took it out, I purchased another one - the ES8036N. The price was the best on the internet and included a free water pik and free shipping. I highly recommend the Panasonics due to their great ability to use foam. I would like to see them bring back the original model I purchased with the titanium blade screen instead of the stainless steel, and it does appear they use far more plastics in these models since my original mostly aluminum/magnesium model, but still overall, best razor I know of.
