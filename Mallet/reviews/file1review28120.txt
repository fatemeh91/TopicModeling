review/text: I bought this because of price and low carbs. I use it for an extra boost at the gym. I don't care for the taste but it's not horrible. But, that's my problem as I am off sugar and all sweetners 100%. The powder dissolves easily in water. I dump a scoop into a about 4 oz water and let it sit a few minutes so I can get any clumps that may form. Give it a stir and down it. My trainer at Gold's suggested the dotFit brand. It is high carb and high price. Can't say I notice any difference other then the lightening of my wallet.
