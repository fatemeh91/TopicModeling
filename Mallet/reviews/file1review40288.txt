review/text: Going on 2 yrs. with a set of these, they are just starting to fray a bit. They are fine for moderate lifting but as suggested by another reviewer, non-cotton would be more suitable for advanced lifts. In my experience the cotton holds moisture so can get pretty stinky if not washed weekly :)Overall, they have served their purpose, just don't expect them to hold up to 400+ lb deadlifts, not made for that.
