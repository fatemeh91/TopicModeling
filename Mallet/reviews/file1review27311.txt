review/text: The quality of this protein powder is some of the best I've ever tried. Syntha-6 move over. The taste isn't like any sweet milkshake or syrupy juice but it's not bad either, and I usually mix any of the chocolate flavors with some unsweetened cocoa powder for an extra boost of flavor and antioxidants. It usually doesn't all dissolve easily with spoon stirring but there aren't any large, hard-to-swallow clumps left behind either and it goes down easy. If you use a blender on it or shake it up vigorously in a thermos then it should all dissolve. Women should not be afraid to try this stuff, it will not buff you up or turn you into some She-Hulk creature, but it will effortlessly help create long, lean muscle mass on you if you are relatively active, plus it helps increase the speed of muscle repair and helps prevent muscle loss when you're inactive for a stretch of time. Only 120 calories per scoop without excess sugar and fat, very light when compared to other powders or supplements. If you take a scoop a day of the 2 pound size it should last approximately a month but you can also take more scoops as needed or based on your activity level. Added to a breakfast or mid-day shake it can be filling, in combination with physical activity you can see the results of it almost immediately and it's quite affordable too. Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard is my new go to protein powder.
