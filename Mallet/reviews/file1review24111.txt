review/text: My doctor told me I had contact dermatitis and wouldn't consider the possibility that I might have an allergy to mites that most people have on their skin and never notice, though everything I read made me think that must be it, since I'd changed detergents, slathered on moisturizers - which made me worse, taken vitamin A, eliminated foods, etc. After trying various herbal remedies with mixed results, as in, nothing was quite strong enough to permanently keep the mites from munching on me, I read someone's online suggestion of sulfur soap, which, thank God, pretty much solved the problem. When it was really bad, sometimes I even applied the soap suds like a lotion and didn't rinse it off. My skin tends to dryness, but this didn't make it worse.I use it all the time, now, and I really love the way the soap smells. It's an old-fashioned smell that I associate with sun-dried sheets and clawfoot tubs. The sulfur smell is kind of an after-smell and very mild.My health food store in Alaska sold it to me for 4.99 at first, but now suddenly it's 6.99(!), so I think I'll be buying it from Amazon while I can get it with free super-saver shipping.
