review/text: I really liked this product!! It had a pleasant, baby powder-like scent and after shaving, my legs felt oh-so-smooooth! I would definitely recommend this to friends and family. The only problem I had with this product was that since it was a gel, it was difficult to control the amount I dispensed, and I felt like I was wasting product. It's more expensive than the cheap shaving cream I usually use, but I liked it so well that I'll buy it again!
