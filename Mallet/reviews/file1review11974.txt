review/text: My wife has been taking different pre-natal/multi vitamins since she's been pregnant, and has settled on this one. I think she took the wal-mart brand multi (which I believe is Centrum) and threw it up almost every time. She would wait until dinner time to take it and still had a difficult time keeping it down. Then her mother bought her some very expensive organic 2-a-day prenatal vitamin that seemed fine, but there was no way to fit a $70 - 30 day supply vitamin into our budget with all the dr bills we were saving for. So I reviewed this one and decided to buy it for her because it was reasonably priced, most of you ladies that reviewed it liked it. Not to mention it was only 1 pill, Once a day.She likes it. It's an average size pill that's kinda smells funky. She still chooses to take it at dinner time, or no sooner than lunch time. I don't think she has ever thrown one up. She'll continue to take one during the lactation period of our son's life too.
