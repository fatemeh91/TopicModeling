review/text: These are just the same as what came with your razor. You shouldn't have any issues whatsoever. Much cheaper to buy this once every 12-18 months than to keep buying POS-on-a-stick & cutting yourself. Either way shaves just as well...that is to say, not quite as good as high quality shaving equipment which most ppl don't even know exists :)
