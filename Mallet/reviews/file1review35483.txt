review/text: If you've ever used a styptic pencil to stop bleeding from shaving cuts and nicks, then you know the pain they can cause. These are individual styptic swabs so they are one-use only (unlike a pencil) and they stop the bleeding almost immediately. Also, unlike a pencil, there's almost no pain since the formula has a slight numbing agent in it (whooo-hoo!). Perfect for men and women and perfect for travelers. Highly recommend.
