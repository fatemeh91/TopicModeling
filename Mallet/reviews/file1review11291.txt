review/text: I read several reviews of this product that say it works wonders and although I only took one dose, I believe that it may in fact work. However, the ingredient list contains 60mg of Tea Tree Oil. Everything I have read about Tea Tree suggests that it should NEVER be ingested. I did a little research and found nothing to contradict that information. Just to be sure, I contacted a trusted herbalist to get a second opinion. She consulted several of colleagues and they all said the same thing...NEVER ingest Tea Tree Oil. So, although this product may cure your Candida, but it contains an ingredient that if ingested can also be toxic or cause internal bleeding or cause you to lapse into a coma, etc., etc., etc. So, I couldn't possibly recommend this to anyone.By the way, I contacted Solaray to ask why they included something like Tea Tree in a supplement. No one ever got back to me.
