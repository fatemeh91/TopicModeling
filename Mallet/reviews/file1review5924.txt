review/text: Was looking for a protein shake container I could throw in my gym bag and shake up on my way there. These containers were not at all what I was looking for. The lid leaks, I know it's not advertised as leak-proof, but when shaking to mix the powder with milk, the liquid splatters all over the place! Disappointed in this purchase, I'm still on the hunt for a leak-proof container!
