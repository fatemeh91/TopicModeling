review/text: Some time around 2009 they stopped making these in Japan, and moved manufacturing to Thailand. Old stock is difficult, if not impossible to find, and delivery from Amazon dealers has yielded only the newer variety. While they claim that the condoms are the same, it is very clear that they are not. The Thai version is visibly more opaque and looks thicker (though the company swears that they are actually thinner now). More importantly they feel much thicker, and smell just a little bit more of latex. While the old Japanese version was incredible and a joy to use, the new Thai condoms feel very much like the desensitizing thick hunks of rubber you'll find in a truck stock rest room, only to be used as a last depressing and disappointing resort. Basically, any reviews before 2010 are probably of the old stock condoms, and are thus out of date. Extra points do go to these condoms for being very cheap as they are on par with anything you'll find at a grocery store-- but no better. It pains me to say it, but please don't buy these condoms until they return to their previous standards of greatness.
