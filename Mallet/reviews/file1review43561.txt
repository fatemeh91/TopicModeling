review/text: I have only had it for a month, but, it is very easy to use. It stores the last 60 blood pressures that have been taken. It, also, tells you when you have moved and need to retake your bp. It also has other items that tell you if something need to be checked by your doctor. I would recommend this item to anyone who needs a blood pressure monitor because it is very easy to use.
