review/text: I've been on these for over a month now and really like the fact that they haven't upset my stomach. They also don't leave behind a yucky aftertaste like some vitamins. Once you take them (I take them with food) then the taste is gone. They are a bit big, but coming from someone who doesn't swallow pills well, they're fine. I am really pleased with this product.
