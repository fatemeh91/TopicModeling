review/text: I originally purchased this product years ago for a shake I read about in a book. Since then that is the only way I have used this. It is so good in the shake that even my 9 year old likes it - and he liked it back when he was 6. It gives me good energy and just makes me feel better. For the shake:1 cup soy milk1 banana1 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder (has 2 grams fiber!)2 stevia packets1 tbsp flax oil (I often omit this due to not having it on hand)4 ice cubes1 scoop super greensBlend up and enjoy. It really is quite good. Oh and of course this 60 serving is the same price as the 30 serving in the health food store. Sad, but true. If you are looking for a good deal and a good product, this is it!
