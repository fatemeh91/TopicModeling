review/text: After I stopped taking birth control, my face started breaking out really bad. I have tried everything to fade my hideous scars and this is the 1st prodct in 3 yrs of searching that I have found that works exactly like it says. And, the product is very affordable. I am on my 3rd week of using and I already have better confidence and I don't have to wear too much makeup! I will continue to use! Looking forward to my end results!
