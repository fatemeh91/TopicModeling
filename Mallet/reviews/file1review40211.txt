review/text: When I first tried this product, I thought that it tasted great. It tasted like a fresh breath of mint gum. But the taste soon wore off, and it started to taste like the polish that a dentist uses. I dislike the pasty taste. I guess that I'm more of a gel-type of person. It was a good performing toothpaste, effective in cleaning my teeth. If you're looking for a good toothpaste, I would recommend it, if you prefer a toothpaste to a gel.
