review/text: I purchased this shaver as a Christmas gift for my husband thinking I was getting quite a deal for my money. The washable and worldwide voltage features are definitely a huge plus. Also, the 5 minute quick charge feature - for a man who ALWAYS forgets to plug the darn thing in until 5 minutes before he has to shave - seem a perfect fit. Unfortunately, all the impressive extras in the world don't really amount to much when the main function of the device - giving a close and comfortable shave - doesn't work. According to my husband, it's jumpy, clunky and leaves stubble and clumps of hair where you're meant to have a clean cut.If you're looking for a shaver for yourself or the man in your life, I'd recommend looking elsewhere. You'd probably be better off with a 20 shaver and a separate trimmer that actually work, rather than this fancy machine that can't even perform its basic task.
