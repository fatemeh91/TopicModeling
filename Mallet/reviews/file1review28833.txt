review/text: I've been drinking 2 shakes/day of Optimum Nutrition for about a year now. Here's how I'd rate the flavors on a 10 point scale:Vanilla Ice Cream: 9Extreme Chocolate: 8Cookies and Cream: 8Delicious Strawberry: 3Something just isn't right with the Strawberry flavor. It tastes....almost chalky, like a TUMS. I tried adding sugar, creamer, strawberry syrup, couldn't get a good taste out of it.
