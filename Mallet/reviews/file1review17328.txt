review/text: I wasn't expecting much from this, but after having my trimmer stolen out of my luggage I needed something to maintain my beard and didn't want to spend a fortune. The price is cheap but the trimmer is awesome! I used it quite a few times right out of the packaging without initially charging it, and the battery life is excellent so far. I've had the trimmer about 2 months now, and I'll update this review if anything changes.
