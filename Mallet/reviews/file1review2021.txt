review/text: I find the wide leather strap that rests on my bunion to be very comfy. I also found that the sizing choices helped get the most comfortable fit which is important since you sleep in it so after a couple of nights you no longer notice it. The plastic regulator's bar that controls the amount you can spread your toe is rigid enough to hold. Others complained of different brands not being strong enough so I went with this one and I'm glad I did! I had a problem with the velcro strap's tab separating where it was glued/heated together, but PediFix's customer service replaced it ASAP with one call! Great service from Amazon & PediFix.
