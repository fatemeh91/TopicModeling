review/text: My doctor suggested that I take Oscillococcinum once a week to build my immune system. I've been doing that and it seems to be working. I take one tube every Sunday and when I fly or am around someone who is sick. The instructions on the box don't say it, but I understand that when you take homeopathic remedies, you should not eat or drink anything for 15 minutes before and after letting the pellets dissolve under your tongue.
