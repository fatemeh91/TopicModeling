review/text: Very easy to clean. This fits on every toilet securely--I've seen some cheap, wobbly ones that never seem to sit properly on the seat. Also, the molded seat is easy for the child to feel secure on. I have two boys. On the cheap seats, little boys tend to pee over the front, but not on this one.
