review/text: I've had carpet sweepers before and was looking forward to getting a Bissell which I'd heard was the best around. Big disappointment. sorry but this one's cheaply made and doesn't do as good a job as the $20 no-name product I had before. The dual bristles and side bristles add nothing. The 3-part push-together handle keeps falling apart even tho I re-installed it according to the directions 3 times. "Sturdy" it is not. I do NOT recommend this product.
