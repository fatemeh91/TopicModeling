review/text: To confirm other reviews, this works quite well. But no quality of hair removal is worth this pain. It is truly incredible. Consider I am a guy and I used it on my face. It works well in removing all the hair but it hurts so ungodly horrible that I'd never recommend it to anyone. So the results are great, but the ends do not justify the means. Go get a really powerful cream, wax, something besides this product. I'll be sending it back.
