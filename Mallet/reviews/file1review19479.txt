review/text: My very little daughter potty trained at 16.5 months when she was only 19 lbs. I was a little concerned that this seat would still be too big to hold her safely, but she has no issues with it. Additionally, it fit onto our toilet perfectly (a Western style toilet in China) and is very secure. No slipping at all!We had been using a little potty seat initially, but the cleanup of that is tiring, and the concept a little disturbing, so we brought this back to China after a trip back to the States. I wasn't sure how my daughter would transition to it since she did like her little potty seat, but she LOVES feeling like a big girl using the big potty. She also likes that she can now reach the toilet paper herself after she is finished going.This is a great concept and a durable product.
