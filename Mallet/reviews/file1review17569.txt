review/text: I was looking for a replacement for my old Philips Norelco T980 and happened on this. The T980 was overall a very good trimmer despite a few minor flaws.Considering how inexpensive the MB-200 is, you would expect to get a low quality trimmer with few features. Remington succeeded in making a very good trimmer that is devoid of several features of more expensive models, which is fine if you don't need that kind of stuff anyway.Pros:- Size is just right and it fits well in the hand. This may seem like kind of a strange criteria, but I thought the T980 was a bit large. The MB-200 is smaller and contours to the shape of your hand.- Wheel-clicks adjust the height of the clipper, meaning you don't have to change anything out for different heights. This is really convenient and the height of the clipper seems quite sturdy regardless of how high it is. There are also 9 different length settings.- Very easy to use and relatively quiet.Cons:- The hair. This can be quite messy - it lacks any sort of chamber or vacuum to catch stray hairs, so be prepared for a mess.- Long charge time.Overall, you can't complain for the price and the quality of the trimmer.
