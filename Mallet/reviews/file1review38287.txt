review/text: It was my mistake to order the vitamins that contain iron. There are others of this brand that say &#34;No Iron&#34; on the label. My body's reaction after I began taking them caused me to check the label and discover the iron. I thought I could use them up by taking 1/2 tablet once per day; but I do not like the way my body reacts; so have stopped taking them. I do not know how I would like them if they did not contain iron.
