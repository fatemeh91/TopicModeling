review/text: Our dishwasher had a lot of soap buildup to the point that the main dispenser doesn't open up when it should and our dishes aren't getting very clean. I've looked online and tried a few methods (tang, vinegar, etc...) to no avail. So, I found a couple cleaners online and thought we would give them a try. I stared with Dishwasher Magic and had high hopes. When the cycle finished the bottle was empty but the inside of the washer hadn't changed. The detergent build up was still there. Moving on to the next one...
