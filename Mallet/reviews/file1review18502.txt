review/text: Have been drinking pomegranate juice every AM for years and was told about the concentrated Jarrow Formula.Keeping it in the fridge does not take up as much room as the 1/2 gal bottles I used to buy and is easy todilute to any strength.I highly recommend keeping an extra bottle when re-ordering.Lawrence
