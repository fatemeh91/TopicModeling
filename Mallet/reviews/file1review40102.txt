review/text: I have been using this mat and accessories for about 2 months now. I am new to yoga, but this product is great. The mat is soft (your feet and hands leave imprints during practice, that shows how soft it is) and it is sturdy too. The blocks have the right height/size to assist those like myself that are not supple yet. Try buying all 4 items individually and you will soon discover that the proposed price for the Valeo deal is really a steal!
