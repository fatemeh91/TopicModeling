review/text: I was so excited to get this and try it! I am pregnant and had gone and had my legs waxed so I wouldn't have to contort my body to get to my legs. Then I read all the reviews and decided I could save money if I just bought this instead of waxing. Well, it didn't really work for me. I have light, thin hair on my legs and it just seemed to break them off. The ones that it actually pulled out left little dot bruises on my legs so I had to wear long pants anyhow. The hair all grew back within a few days (no better than shaving) and it left my legs really, really, really dry. I wasn't any more impressed with the results of waxing, so I think I'll just be sticking with a razor. The size is great, it didn't hurt much (but it just broke off the hairs!), and seemed like a great little gizmo, but it just isn't for me.
