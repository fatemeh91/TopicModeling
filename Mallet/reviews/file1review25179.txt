review/text: I'll first say that these are the first ear plugs I've ever purchased so I can't really compare them to anything. What I can say for certain is that I read a ton of reviews on many different kinds b/c I was leery...will they be uncomforable? will I be able to fall asleep with them in? will they fall out? can they really block that much sound? Fortunately, I found these to be pretty darn comfortable (I mean it's gonna feel odd with something foreign in your ears, but not in the least uncomfortable!), I didn't have any trouble falling asleep, they have only come out once (probably due to poor insertion) and they block out a TON of sound. I have a very loud roommate who loves to cook when she gets home after work...at 11pm. I have hardwood floors that make EVERYTHING echo, so with being a person up at 5am and a light sleeper, this is not the best situation. In addition, now that nice weather is here, there have been tons of birds outside my window chirping at, get this, 3:30am!!! the sun hasn't even begun to rise! Anyway, I can't talk enough good about these plugs. They do take some time getting use to how to properly roll and insert them before they expand too much, but once you have that...it's Heaven!
