review/text: I have been following a meal plan that includes 20-30% protein in every meal and snack. The MET-Rx bars provide that and they are delicious. When using it as a meal replacement I eat the whole bar; if for a snack I cut off 1/3 of it so I eat just 206 calories. They are really handy when I am not at home and finding well balanced snacks and meals are more of a challenge. I have recommended them to many people and will continue to do so. I have a box delivered to my door once a month from Amazon.
