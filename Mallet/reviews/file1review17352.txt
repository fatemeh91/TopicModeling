review/text: The Good:+ It works well on sideburns+ Zoom wheel feature is great+ Stays charged for a long time+ Decent priceThe Bad:+ There is no "low battery" indicatorI bought this trimmer about one year ago and I lost the recharging cord recently. I decided to re-buy the MB-200 because I am happy with the product. I wanted an all-in-one sideburns trimmer that had a extension function built in (aka: zoom wheel). This trimmer fit the bill & I'm very happy with my purchase(s).
