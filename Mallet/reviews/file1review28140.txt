review/text: Let me start by saying that I bought a 5 lb tub of this suff(chocolate) for college without ever trying it. The reviews and ratings seemed good enough for me to try it, and it is amazing. It mixes very well and it tastes great(like chocolate milk, without the protein aftertaste). Another thing that drew me to this product was the low fat levels. I had bought four different brands of protein powder before this, and ALL of them had more fat, and tasted worse. I am extremely pleased with this purchase, and i would recommend this to ANYONE.
