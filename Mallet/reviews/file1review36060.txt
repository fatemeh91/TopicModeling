review/text: I take arginine & citrulline daily on an empty stomach, because of how they induce the body to naturally release nitric acid (a phenomenon heavily researched by the Nobel Prize winning physician, Dr. Louis Ignarro). Nitric Oxide lowering blood pressure by relaxing blood vessels & reduces inflammation (the impact of chronic inflammation is heavily researched world wide). I'd highly recommend it.
