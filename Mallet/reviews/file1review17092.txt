review/text: It's a fairly good trimmer but the batteries do not last very long. If I charge it and use it a few weeks later, it will not last as long as I need to trim my beard. You have to leave it plugged in charging all the time in order for it to be ready when you need it. I have had several Norelco shavers and none had this problem. In the future, I will probably look for the Norelco name. I thought Remington was probably a good name brand but now I am not so sure.
