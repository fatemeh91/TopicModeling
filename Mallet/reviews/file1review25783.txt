review/text: I used the trimmer for about 6 months, it worked great in that it cut the hair down very nicely, but it had a couple of downsides.1. It would get very warm and and some times pull2. When I dropped it, the cap came of very easily and the head hit the ground.(I thought the cap was supposed to protect it?) Anyway I tried to mess with it to make it keep spinning but nothing I did help, I only dropped it a foot of the ground onto a carpet floor.
