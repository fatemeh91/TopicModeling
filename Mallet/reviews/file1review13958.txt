review/text: These items just come LOOSE, stuffed into a Mailer-bubble envelope. There was absolutely "NO" packaging around the mouth pieces, not even a simple ziplock baggie - nada, nothing. That is not sterile at all. In addition, "NO" instructions were enclosed to tell me how to do it! I'm really disgusted. I'm going to have to look on the internet to find out how to make them. The point is "Who does something like that??"...Somebody very inconsiderate!!
