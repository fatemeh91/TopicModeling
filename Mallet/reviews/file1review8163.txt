review/text: I had a couple wide water battles with thin openings which the dishwasher couldn't clean. Hand washing also didn't work as I couldn't get my hand inside the bottle. However, this brush did the job perfectly.Pros:- The arm is flexible and bends a bit, which makes it easier to reach the sides of a wide bottle.- The brush holds soap well, and does a good job scrubbing. I had a smoothie in the water bottle, and the brush got the leftover residue/tiny seeds off the sides that the dishwasher missed.- Easy to useCons:- None so far
