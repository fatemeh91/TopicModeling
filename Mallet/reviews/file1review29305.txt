review/text: I have been looking for extra long straws for awhile to use in my 32 ounce mug. Most of the straws I found were too short and would fall in my mug. These straws are the perfect length so, they don't fall in my mug. I was the most concerned about the length of the straw when I purchased them but, it is fun to have a variety of colors too. I also like that they are flexible. I received my purchase quickly. The product was packaged well and came undamaged.
