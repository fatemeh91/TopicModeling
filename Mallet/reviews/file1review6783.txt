review/text: The body back buddy enables one to press on hard to reach trigger points and thereby relieve pain. The booklet enclosed with the product gives several examples of ways to use it. A fuller description is also available for purchase. I find the product easy to use and effective in reducing spasm of pain. It was recommended by my massage therapist.
