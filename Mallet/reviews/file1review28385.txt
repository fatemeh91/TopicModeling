review/text: I bought this just recently and used it only once or twice, but the effects were significantly noticeable right off the bat. I usually forgo eating dinner then jog, followed by a light workout (pushup, pullups, situps, etc), and it kept me going even after I usually stop. So much so that even though my muscles were exhausted, my energy was still going strong and I wanted to keep going only after a short break. What was really amazing was that, I was not sore the following day! The flavor is not too bad. It almost takes like watered down Yoohoo, but not as sweet. There are tons of smoothie recipes online so taste won't be too much of a problem.But enough about the product, I want to commend Amazon for their great service in this review and feedback.. I won't get into the specifics but Amazon went above and beyond with their customer service and gained my loyalty for life. If every company had such outstanding service as Amazon displayed with me, then Consumer Affairs would be out of business.
