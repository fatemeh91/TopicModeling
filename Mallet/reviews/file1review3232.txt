review/text: I've owned Tweezerman slant edge tweezers in the past, and chose to buy them again because they are sharp and keep the edge for a long time. They are guaranteed for life, but the hassle and shipping and handling costs for return just make it easier to buy new ones. I have a pair of small ones for travel and a regular size for regular home use. There are better tweezers out there, but at a much greater price.
