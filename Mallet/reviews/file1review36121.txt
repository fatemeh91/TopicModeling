review/text: I ordered this item because I could get it included with the free super saver shipping. Also, I generally like yerba prima products. This one, however, really plugged me up. After the 1st week of the "gentle" cleanse I was constipated so I decided to apply the heavier cleanse(doubleing the dose). This really plugged me up so after another 7-8 days or so I threw the remainder of the capsules out and went back to the psyllium husks + colon care formula and was regular in 2-3 days. This may work for some people but not for me!
