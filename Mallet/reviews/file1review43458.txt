review/text: I bought the "Intellisence" Blood Pressure Monitor because it was the most highly rated in a Consumer Reports review of a couple of years ago. So far, it has performed very well, though I have not had the opportunity to check its accuracy against the more sophisticated devices at a doctor's office.The combination heart rate (pulse) monitor and memory feature are nice extras. In summary, I am very pleased with the product.
