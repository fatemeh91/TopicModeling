review/text: I purchased Degree Anti-perspirant Spray Sport, as it never leaves a white ring around your arm pits, on you clothes. It is advertized for men, but I like the smell and best of all, it does not leave that dreadful stain on your dresses, shirts etc. Plus it does the job, not sweat, no smell. How many times have you put a sweater over your head after apply an Anti-perspirant and it is all over your clothing.I have had enough, and started testing product in the stores, spraying it on my wrist. I know you are not suppose to do this, but after having dozens of sprays, roll-on etc. that left that awful ring, I was not going to have a closet full of product, I would not use. All was not lost, I gave it to my husband. However, he was out of an anti-perspirant and I gave him one of my cans. Well, you know what happened, now I have to share.I thought I ordered so I would get 3 orders of 3 cans of spray, for a total of nine but I was only sent one. I wanted to save on shipping charges. I have learned that whenever I find something good, the company discontinues it. I wanted to be prepared. Now I have to order it again and pay more shipping so I can have it on hand. You know the old saying "never let them see you sweat" especially in these times. I don't know why this is not advertized as an antiperpirant intended for the use of both men and women. In fact for the whole family.Great Product, Lila Hamilton
