review/text: Although I occasionally try other brands, I've been a committed user ofEdgeshaving cream since the presidency of ....yes, of Gerald Ford.Nivea's sensitive shaving gel has changed my loyalties. I have dry skin --especially in the winter-- and need to take extra measures to keep it moist while avoiding nicks and cuts from the blade. Since I don't go around unshaved, I'm always on the lookout for any advantage in the war between skin and blade.Nivea is mildly (and pleasantly) scented, and provides excellent protection. Nice stuff; choose with confidence. No matter how tough you may be, the skin on your face is always looking for a little tenderness. Combine withNivea post-shave balm for sensitive skin; the rest of the day may be hard on your face, but this will give you a couple soothing moments.
