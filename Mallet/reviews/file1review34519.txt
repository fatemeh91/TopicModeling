review/text: I take this form of magnesium to also benefit from the calming effects of taurine. I am taking this as a preventative since magnesium is so important as a cofactor in bodily processes. One important preventative is regulating the heart's electrical processes. In this case, one cannot tell if it is doing anything obvious, but I feel it is important enough to take given that an inadequate dietary intake of magnesium is possible and even common in some cases.
