review/text: This mask has some serious strap flaws.1) The strap is too thick. One strap over laps and attaches to the other strap and creates a THICK piece of fabric which digs into the back of your head. Not very relaxing.2) The strap slides around, usually down toward my ears. Again, not very relaxing.3) The Velcro is the wrong method for this type of adjustable strap. With Velcro there is the soft piece with the loops and the scratchy piece with tiny hooks that attach to the loops on the other piece with loops. With this mask, the scratchy side faces down toward the pillow and keeps pulling threads our of my pillow case. Great. Thanks for ruining my silk pillow cases.If you reverse the strap, then the scratchy side digs into your scalp. Wonderful.My advice: forget the mask. And use a T-shirt to cover your eyes. It works better and is much more comfortable.
