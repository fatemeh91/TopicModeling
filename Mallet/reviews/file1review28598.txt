review/text: Overall this has been a wonderful purchase. I'm running out of Protein so I've recently decided to switch to theirOptimum Nutrition 100% Natural Oats and Whey Vanilla Bean, 3 Poundwhich will hopefully help me get some more fiber in my diet. I've really enjoyed Optimum Whey. The nice thing is that it doesn't have all the additives and extras that some of the other brands provide. I'm sure that they have their benefit, but I just want the protein not some magical ingredients or fillers that make it cost more.It mixes Well.It Taste Great (better in milk, but not horrible in water)It last a long time.I highly recommend it.
