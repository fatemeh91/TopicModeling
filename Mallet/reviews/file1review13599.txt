review/text: Oral B Hummingbird Flosser Starter Kit Unit, Assorted Colors (Pack of 3)Great product!! I had gum surgery a couple of years ago and bought one after seeing the ad on the "gift bag" from the surgeon. I started using them and have completely eliminated the "pockets" from my gums and am getting excellent checkups. I tried to buy them at the local stores and discoved they had apparently been discontinued so I hit the internet. What a shame- I guess not for internet sales but I can't believe local stores no longer carry them. I'm not alone, I've given the internet information to friends, who are now also buying on line.
