review/text: These rags are probably the some of the best things I've ever found for cleaning, polishing, drying, and using for about a thousand other purposes.They're extremely tough, and don't tear easily (probably 10x stronger than a standard paper towel), so they're great for wiping down rough surfaces (like metal, rubber, concrete, etc.), and for laying down under a project to make sure screws and other loose bits don't go wandering off.They absorb as much as a hand towel, so they're great for sopping up messes, drying things, and placing under leaky things to catch drips.I've used shop towels for staining, polishing, drying, cleaning, mopping, and dusting, and this box of 200 is good for at least 2-3 months in my usage. I bought a box for my garage and one for my workshop in the basement, and I use them frequently. Amazon offers a pretty good deal--it's about the same price here as it is at a local hardware store, and Prime shipping makes it a no-brainer.
