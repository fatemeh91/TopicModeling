review/text: Works great for me! I don't feel sick when I take these like I have with other diet pills. They make me feel energized but not too wired or jittery and also suppress my appetite great. I've lost 5 pounds in the first week and it's not too expensive so if you personally aren't happy with it you havent thrown away too much money. I suggest buying one box at the drug store (10 bucks) first before ordering a three pack, everyone's body is different.
