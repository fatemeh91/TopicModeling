review/text: Prescription prenatal vitamins are expensive and I was searching for a prenatal vitamin that costs less but still provides all the essential vitamins and minerals for a healthy growing fetus. Prenatal one vitamin gives you this and more than most prescription prenatal vitamins. The only negative is the size of the pill and that it only gives you 800mcg than the required 1000mcg of folic acid. I am using this for preconception and I don't have any after taste or constipation.
