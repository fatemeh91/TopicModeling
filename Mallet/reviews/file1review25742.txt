review/text: I went through about a half dozen different nose/ear hair trimmers before finding this one. This one by far superceeds all the others (some of which were way more costly). It does a terrific job of trimming hair and keeping the blades away from your skin. It also doesn't get "clogged" like some of the other trimmers I've tried. Good product!
