review/text: I was excited about this product when I ordered it. I read the reviews and an off site endorsement that claimed it was "essential" for working on shoulder and neck muscles.This is a small device, easily held in one hand. I can use it on my neck muscles, but it does not offer enough leverage to use on my very tight shoulder muscles. I can reach the muscles with it, but I cannot use it to loosen up the primary muscles I planned to use it for. I can work on the smaller muscles in my arms and it does feel relaxing to roll it over the muscles in my face. It is too small to do much good on my legs and calves.I do not find it an "essential" tool. Speaking for myself, I believe there are better tools to use on my shoulders that will loosen my shoulder muscles. I just have to find the right tool and this is not it.
