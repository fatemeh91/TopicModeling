review/text: Have been using this for a few years now. It's simple, digests fairly easily and top-quality whey.Top flavors are Caramel Toffee Fudge and Chocolate Mint when paired with Whole Milk.I strongly recommend a Blender Bottle (or something equivalent). I used to just add a scoop to a cup of milk and stir with a spoon but blending it makes it so much better.
