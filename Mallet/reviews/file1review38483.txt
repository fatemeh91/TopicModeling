review/text: Emjoi is a great epilator but I gave it 3 stars because it is not comfortable to hold and it quit working after 1 week. The product works great for it's purpose, I would love more it if it had a better way to handle- it's a little small. That aside I will continue to use until I find a better product. Amazon quickly replaced the broken one- I am pleased with Amazons customer service!
