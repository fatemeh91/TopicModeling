review/text: I wanted a second Braun for travel. The price of this one was amazing (under $40) so I thought I'd try it. Well, you get what you pay for. The shave is very poor; takes several passes over a spot to do what a normal priced Braun can do in a single pass. This thing actually cut me too; I've used various Brauns now for over 10 years and none has ever cut me (unless the foil was torn, of course). For travel, there's no lock (as another reviewer pointed out), which is a horrible design choice; this razor could easily turn on while in your suitcase. It also does not come with a case of any kind (very odd). The trimmer is useful, and that's pretty much all I use it for now. (And, it's ugly, but who really cares). I basically gave it to my 17 year old, and even he says it's annoying to use compared to mine, and he's got like 9 facial hairs.For under $40, it's tolerable. But if you really need to use a razor regularly, lay down the $80-$120 for a better model. Braun really should not put their name on this model; their other products are in a different quality category.
