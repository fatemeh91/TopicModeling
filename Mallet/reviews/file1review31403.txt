review/text: I bought this tape because I kept getting rashes left on my skin from all the other tapes I used. This tape has been great it doesn't cause rashes on my skin, it has the right amount of stickiness, not too much and not to little. It's easy to peel off and tear, no scissors are needed with this tape. If you are looking for a tape that is effective but yet gentle on the skin, buy this.
