review/text: As another reviewer indicated the first thing that struck me was the durability of the unit. The fabric seems thicker and more durable then similar products I have tried. Even with the thicker fabric the feeling of the beads moving while the ball is manipulated is not diminished. The quantity and density of the beads in the ball is also about right. The ball does not seem too overstuffed to diminish the scope of feeling and also the device is not under filled which would diminish the pleasure as well.Overall this is a really nice ball. I bought this primarily as a stress reliever and for that purpose it is great. Unlike other stress relievers that are more puzzles this can be manipulated mindlessly throughout the day while I work on my other tasks. It is also something I can do on the job without being to obvious about it.
