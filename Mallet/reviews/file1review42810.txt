review/text: My husband has taken this product for a couple years and it has helped some of the adverse problems caused by his Crohns diease, like gas and diarrhea. I also used for my problem of constipation, it also helped me.I found it cheaper on Amazon and ordered. The problem came in when we both could not swallow with out choking. I called Garden of Life and they said it was made with there new coating and we could just grind it and take it that way. This has caused my husband to change product, I still take it ground with applesauce at night. For a product we learned to love to one I work to get it down.
