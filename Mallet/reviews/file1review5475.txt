review/text: First we used it to cut one of my friends and it seemed to work OK because his hair was so thick. After my wife cut my hair, her worries dissapeared because it worked so much better than my old one and it is also cordless so it is really convenient. I hated when the cord of the old machine used to touch me while cutting with its cold cord. I definitely recommend this hair cutter because it does its job really well, it is cordless and very affordable.
