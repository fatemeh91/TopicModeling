review/text: i have purchased one of these sleep masks before from the manufacturer. when i purchased this one to replace it i had only had it for a few months before the fabric started to come apart. the quality is terrible. i don't know why the amazon product wouldn't be as good but it wasn't. i won't buy these from amazon again.the item itself let's in light around the nose but i tolerate it because it's so light and the strap is easy to adjust since it's wide and velcro. i'm still hunting for the perfect sleep mask though!
