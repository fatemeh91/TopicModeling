review/text: Our daughter loves this potty seat. She asks to sit on it every time she walks past the bathroom and will stay on it longer than she will sit still anywhere else in the house. It was so easy to adjust to securely fit our toilet, but also comes off quickly too. The hook allows us to hang it next to the toilet when she isn't using it.
