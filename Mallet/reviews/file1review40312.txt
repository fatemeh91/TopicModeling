review/text: The good news is that most of the reviews for this product have been positive, what's lacking is true scientific research to validate its claim that it provides a quick immune defense/boost. That means comparing it to a placebo. I suspect (but have no proof) that most of the positive effect can be explained by the placebo effect.I was just getting over a cold and felt another one come on. I took these pills and I didn't get sick. But maybe that's because I slept well. Or because of the placebo effect. There are many factors.So you're paying $17 for two-days worth of pills. There are 20 pills, and you're supposed to take 10 pills per day. So it's pretty pricey - but that may be worth it if it prevents a cold that will knock you out for a week.Buy it only if you believe it will work.
