review/text: ok so i'm not a body builder or an athlete, i'm quite the opposite of that. i'm lazy, unfitt, and morbidly skinny. for years i've been trying to put on some weight to no avail. i'm also a vegitarian and dislike to eat meat, yet needed the protein source...hence the Gold Standard Whey Protein.i purchased the strawberry kind. i drink it with milk before i have my meals. the taste isn't as bad as i thought it would be (having tasted protien bars.) its too early to say that i've had any real body changes, but hopfully this product can supply me with a dearly needed protein source that would drape my skeleton with flesh.
