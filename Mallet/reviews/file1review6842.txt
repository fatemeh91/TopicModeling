review/text: This a good little loupe, with great magnification and size, but it's not put together very well. The top portion and the lower skirt meet at a slight angle; it's not enough to mar the performance as a loupe, but it's enough to notice and make you feel like it's a very cheap piece of plastic. If you're looking for a cheap loupe that works great, this one's a good pick, but if you want quality keep going.
