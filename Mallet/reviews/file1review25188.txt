review/text: These were exactly what I needed. My boyfriend snores and I am a VERY light sleeper. These are a life saver. Takes a little time to get used to putting them in. When I first used them what I found easiest was getting the end of a q-tip damp and getting your ear canal slightly wet so they'll insert easier, then roll the ear plugs and they go in perfectly. Then once I got the hang of rolling them they went in fine without my ear being slightly damp. Love this product!!! I would recommend them to anyone, just be patient when you first use them!!! Ordering more soon!
