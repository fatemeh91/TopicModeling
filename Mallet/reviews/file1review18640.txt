review/text: I'm not sure why it's so hard to figure out if a specific comb works with a specific clipper. It felt like finding this particular comb took much more research than it should, but I'm glad I can confirm that the Oster "Universal" combs seem to fit on my Fast Feed perfectly. It also seems to be of higher quality (smoother teeth and attaches more securely) than the combs that came with the unit. In fact, the reason I bought this was to replace my 1/4" comb that had poorly cut teeth that'd scratch my scalp.I was hoping to move up to stainless by tryingWahl 3372-100 #4 Stainless Steel Comb, but unfortunately it didn't quite fit my Oster correctly.One more note in case it wasn't clear: this isn't JUST for animal clippers! Works quite lovely on my human head.
