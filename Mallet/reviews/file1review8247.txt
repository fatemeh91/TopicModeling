review/text: we originally purchased a bottle brush at Wal Mart, but they only carried brushes for cleaning baby bottles. This turned out to be completely useless, so I purchased the OXO brush from Amazon. It is a well made product that is long enough to clean inside my half-gallon glass milk containers. Another useful kitchen tool to make life easier.
