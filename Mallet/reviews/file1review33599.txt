review/text: My first waterpik lasted 7 years. As a replacement, my wife picked up a Conair Interplak. What a piece of junk. I had to point it at my hand to see if it was moving any water.Saw this on Amazon and bought it. WOW. Hopefully this will last 7 years like the first. Nice strong jet. No doubt that its cleaning along the gum line. The pause button does take a little force to hold down. Not one cavity in seven years since I began using a water jet.---------------------------------------After 3 months of use, it started leaking at the little rubber grommet at bottom of water tank. Will be calling WaterPik to get a replacement tank or grommet. Still no doubt that this little baby is getting the gum line clean. Waterpik replaced the tank grommet without hassel.----------------------------------------January 2009 - Still going strong after almost 3 years.------------------------------May 2010 - Still going after 4-1/2 years. Money well-spent.
