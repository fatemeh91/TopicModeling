review/text: I purchased 2 Adapt-A-Laps about 4 years ago, and used it maybe 3 times.The testimonials of its value seem genuine, but I never got the point of it. A laptop, you can just put in your lap, and the monitor angle can be adjusted; that seems convenient enough.As for books, maybe I was just spoiled from the Levo BookHolder. The Adapt-A-Lap just doesn't seem to offer much benefit, at least for me.One of the main problems is that there are 3 protruding 'shelves' on the AAL, to accommodate a magazine, small book or larger book. But the top and middle shelf get in the way of the bottom shelf. If you place a larger book on the bottom shelf, the book doesn't lean comfortably against the main surface of the AAL. It would make more sense for the shelves to be foldable, somehow.Before you purchase, take a look at it from different angles, read the testimonials. Perhaps you can find a good use for it. Others have.Regarding customer service - good people. After the purchase, Adapt-A-Lap customer service kindly asked (in an email) if I could write a review of the product. I told them that I'd prefer not to review, couldn't really offer any positive feedback, but that I had no intention of trying to get a refund. They responded that it's no problem, that their customers shouldn't have to be stuck with a product they don't want, to feel free to return it for a full refund, and thanks for trying it out.4 years later, I never attempted to return the product, and still have it. But the manufacturer's polite attitude left a positive impression.
