review/text: I depend on joint flex cream. I have chronic back pain from sports injuries, car accidents, and falls. So far, it's the only over the counter pain cream that seems to work. Have tried "aspercreme", "stop pain", and other therma heat creams but none help. I highly recommend this product.
