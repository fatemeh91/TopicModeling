review/text: Since I've purchased this, I've been very pleased to say the least. I accidently dropped and broke my Norelco 20XL which was still working perfect after 10+ years, so I decided to start looking for something similar and that wouldn't set me back a lot of money. I narrowed it down to this kit by Wahl and I'm very glad I decided to buy this. The majority of the reviews here are accurate, but the more negative ones don't reflect this product in my opinion, and I'm glad I disregarded them.I shave my own head every month or so and I find that these clippers get the job done in around 10 minutes instead of the 30+ minutes I've been used to. I don't think these are professional, but I honesty can't tell the difference. They seem to be extremely similar to the ones that they use at barber shops. The clipper itself is great quality and very durable plus you get a ton of accessories and attachments with this kit. Contrary to another review that says these plastic attachments are flimsy and bendable, they are in fact solid and sturdy plastic and I find no problem at all with them. This false claim of supposedly cheap attachments almost dissuaded me from purchasing this, so I thought I'd address that in my review.In summation, I'm very happy with this product from Wahl. I think the electric clipper is worth the money just by itself, so I don't think you'll be disappointed.
