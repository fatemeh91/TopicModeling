review/text: When I could not find these replacement blades, I tried one of the new 4 blade razors. It did not even come close to giving the smooth, close shave these blades do. The wide, flat handle of the women's sensor razor eliminates rolling in your hand when shaving, minimizing the possibility of cuts, as well. Hands down, this is the best product I have ever used to shave my legs.
