review/text: This is a good snack or break food. After my afternoon workout, it filled me up and gave me energy. It satisfied my craving for a sweet chocolate taste too. It had a good chewy texture and it gave my mouth a good workout, flavor, and chew. It was a bit high on the calorie range, but had all the nutrients to keep it healthy.
