review/text: This product was sent to me as a gift by a wo-worker when I severely sprained my ankle. I was skeptical at first, but after using the gel and pills for a week, I saw a dramatic improvement-the bruising and swelling went down on my ankle and the pain decreased.Also, the muscle aches in my arms and shoulders from using crutches was incredibly painful-I could barely lift my arms above my head the first week. After using some of the gel, the pain disappeared immediately.So I saw immediate short term, as well as long term benifits. It worked so well, when the tube my co-worker ran out, I bought this replacement packet.
