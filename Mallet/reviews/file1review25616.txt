review/text: Gentlemen, let me give you a some free information. The average woman is a little shorter than the average man (about 6 inches I have read), so that means that all too often we find ourselves looking up your noses. And, if there is one thing that turns many of us off, it is the sight of all sorts of hair streaming out of your nostrils! (How do some of you guys breathe?)Anyway, I highly recommend this excellent groomer, which does an excellent job of getting rid of that unsightly nose and ear hair. It doesn't pinch or pull, and is very easy to use. I got one for the guy in my life about a year ago, and am very happy with the results. Take my advice, gentlemen, and get grooming!(Review of Panasonic ER411NC Nose and Ear Hair Groomer)
