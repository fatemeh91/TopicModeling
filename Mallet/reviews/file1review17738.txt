review/text: Its a good trimmer and is well designed and feels sturdy. The battery does seem to need frequent recharging though. My earlier trimmer would go a lot of days without a charge.But this one somehow manages to remain cleaner with not too much hair getting stuck in the grill and the blades. Thats definitely a plus.
