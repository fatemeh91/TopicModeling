review/text: I have tried several other natural or organic vitamin supplements for my 3 year old who started preschool and was getting sick a lot. Nothing worked. I was shocked to find some of the supplements I tried had a moderate amount of lead in them (FDA study of vitamins). I wanted to keep ingredients all natural with no additives or possible lead. My toddler cannot be coaxed into eating a daily vitamin even if it looks like a gummy bear or a berry and powders contain lead so a liquid seemed ideal and could be hidden in juice, etc. This product really does seem to work. No colds since starting the bottle. And no struggle with eating a daily vitamin.
