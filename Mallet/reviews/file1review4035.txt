review/text: This item arrived before the "expected" date. The first blade did not give a good shave. I contacted the vendor, who offered to exchange the blades, or just give me a credit upon receipt of the returned blades. (Purchase was for my friend).Since I knew we didn't want a credit, I suggested that my friend try a different blade, and the 2d blade was better than the 1st one. So he decided to keep the blades. We have had this happen with these blades before - and contacted Gillette directly ourselves, and they replaced them! It's not the vendor's fault - this isa problem with Gillette. We have no problem with Amazon or their vendor.
