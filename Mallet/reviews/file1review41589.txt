review/text: This toothbrush is amazing it really cleans your teeth to remove the plague and whiten your tooth naturally. In comparison to the Sonicare you'll notice the Oral b triumph moves in-and-out 40,000 times per minute & side-to-side 8,800 times per minute. Compare the Sonicare 9500 produces 31,000 bristle sweeps per minute no side to side movement. Their replacement heads are cheaper and easier to clean too. I even bought another for my father I liked it that much. I recommend you buy a rechargeable toothbrush even if it is the sonicare because the pulsations you get per minute are three to four times the pulsations you get from a non rechargeable toothbrush. You'll notice the difference after one use & I like to brush now more than ever before because of how clean I feel. I also want to mention the picture of the toothbrush is wrong it is not the 9400 model being shown, however I got the 9400 from amazon as the product describes.
