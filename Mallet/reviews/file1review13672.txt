review/text: I was looking for the more simple version of the Firefly toothbrushes, and was so happy thinking I found them that I didn't read the details. When they arrived, not only do they light up, but the stems are a bit larger in diameter (which makes it easier for little hands to hold on to). The larger stems accommodate a little character, and when you shake it or turn it over, there is a little "lava lamp" like thing going on. Very cute! I like that there's a box of 12 so both of our girls have a good supply of toothbrushes. At such a young age, they tend to chomp on the toothbrushes, wearing them out pretty fast.
