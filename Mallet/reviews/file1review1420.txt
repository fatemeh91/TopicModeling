review/text: Good scale, functions adequately for our purposes, however I had hoped the base would be a little more weighty to keep the scale stable. We have a 2 year old, and he could EASILY topple this scale sideways. Heck, a gust of wind might do it, even. Straight out of the box, I noticed the indicator arm housing was bent. There was no package damage inside or out, so it had to have occurred before or during packing, not shipment, which makes me question Detecto's quality control standards. Fortunately the bend was not bad, and easily bent back by hand, which does not speak well for sturdiness of materials in the design, either.The zero seems to set and stay well, but I think they should have made the turn-screw with a Phillips head socket or included a knob of some type for adjusting the zero; The flat head slot is awkward for older hands to maintenance.Otherwise, functionality is very good, we verified its accuracy with other scales and specific dumbbells of known weights.For the price, it is more than adequate, and if you have none of the issues I mentioned above, I could see someone rating this scale as high as 4 stars, but not five. It's just not that hardy of a construct.
