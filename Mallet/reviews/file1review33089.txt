review/text: I first used this formula when on vacation in Juneau AK and thought I was getting a cold. Bought it in small store on main street as recommended by sales clerk. It worked wonders. No cold, no symptoms by evening. My daughter was getting sick so I gave her some that I had just received from Amazon and she said it was a miracle formula. She is a sales person and has customers who have told her to use Source Naturals Wellness Formula Herbal Defense also as they swear by it.This item came very quickly and was free shipping. Definitely will always keep this on hand and will order again from Amazon as great price.Diana Stegner, Portland, OR
