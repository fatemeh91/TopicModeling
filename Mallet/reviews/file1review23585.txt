review/text: These work well with the intended Simplehuman trash can. The are a perfect fit, which looks nice. They are strong and lift a heavy load. I always take them out when the trash can is full. They haven't ripped or dripped on me yet. I give them a Net Promoter Score of 10 - I'm a promoter.
