review/text: I ordered this as my first rabbit, after reading the other reviews I thought that it would be a good choice. It arrived in very discrete packaging, which I thought was awesome. The price was good, especially when compared to other websites.It did have a slight rubbery smell to it when I opened the package, but it goes away.This rabbit is pretty large, but not so much so that it is unmanagable. When using it alone, I found that the rabbit ears are very stiff but if they are positioned right can get the job done. The revolving balls were REALLY uncomfortable and I ended up not using them at all. I think that if the rubber were a little softer that it may be a little more comfortable. Maybe its just not for me, but I was expecting alot more.The reason I gave it a 3 star rating -I let the hubby use it on me once, and it did its job well!
