review/text: I have tried every single brand of rhodiola rosea out there and I find this one is the most effective and most standardized. I have read a book on Rhodiola rosea as well and this was one of the recommended products that they have done successful clinical studies with. Don't get me wrong, the other products work as well, but not as efficiently as this. If you want to get the best, go with this product. I also suggested this product to several of my friends and we all find that it eliminates anxiety. I have a panic disorder and ever since I started using this, it has disappeared. I know it sounds too good to be true, but it really does work just like that. For me it even works better than all the antidepressants that I have taken for anxiety. It also helps me with memory, I noticed I had an easier time remembering things for my exam on days I took it verses days I did not. I also like ordering from this company as sometimes they give me free products.
