review/text: I researched all sorts of elevated toilet seats and became primarily concerned with stability since reviewers of the elevated seats without legs mentioned how careful you had to be, i.e., if you shifted your weight they could slide off the toilet seat. The thing I kept hearing from medical staff about post surgery was "don't fall." I could just picture myself on an unstable toilet seat, 40 staples in my leg, being dumped onto the tile floor. I figured that this toilet seat with its own legs would be the sturdiest and I've been very pleased with the decision. I'm using it with a basic, 25 yr old Standard toilet with not much space between the bathtub and toilet on one side and the toilet paper roll/cabinet on the other but this Ableware extra-wide tall-ette fits just fine. I've been using it for almost 2 weeks and it's a lifesaver. I'm 225 lbs and 5'5". I back the walker up to the toilet, switch my grip from the walker to the padded toilet seat handles, move the bad leg forward, and can then easily sit on the toilet and get back up w no problem.
