review/text: This item is used for quick visual acuity exams when other testing methods are no available. It is similar to what many use in training. I use it in a grab and go bag when I am asked to exams outside my normal office setting. For that purpose, it is fine. It is quite light weight, so take care n storing it so it does not get bent or folded.
