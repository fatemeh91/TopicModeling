review/text: I started taking this product after hearing a friend comment on how much it has helped her menopausal symptoms. Prior to beginning this product I had all the typical symptoms (hot flashes, night sweats, moodiness) and fatigue as well. I took the max dose and after 3 weeks of taking the product I started to notice a change with my symptoms lessening. NOW, I do not have the hot flashes, night sweats and yes, even my mood has improved. I do feel I have more energy as well. This is definitely worth a try!!! I can't say it will work for everyone but it has certainly worked for me!!!!!
