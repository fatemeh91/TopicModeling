review/text: We have a large room rug in our living room and I was tired of dragging the vacuum out on a daily basis to clean up dog and cat hair, crumbs, etc. The Bissel is precisely what I wanted and use it every day and do not have to worry about plugging anything in...all I do is zoom it around, dump the trays and I am done. Thank you Amazon and Bissell!
