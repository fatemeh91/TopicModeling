review/text: I bought this elsewhere to replace my failing WP60. I've owned perhaps 10 WP60's, since the 1970's. They fail regularly when the feed tube to the nozzle breaks, and later, when the motor fails (seized and/or fails to supply water due to cavitation of the fluid and pump failure).Generally, these provide a very clean mouth experience, especially when used with a shot of mouthwash (instructions say they are safe for that use). Yes, you will see gunk come out of your teeth even after a thorough brushing. Surely they cut down on bacteria, and odor, but they don't stop plaque.Now to compare: the new WP65 is almost identical to my old WP60, but the motor is significantly quieter (yea!), and the power from the nozzle is a bit less (boo!). It is now less than I would like. Over time, as the unit ages and weakens, I wonder if this will shorten the useful lifespan. Finally, the blue plastic cover/supply reservoir is less strong than the white one of the WP-60. I could imagine it cracking in a couple of years.If I had had the choice I would have simply bought another WP60. I get about 3 years out of these things before they have to be chucked, but that's only $12 a year, so worth it.
