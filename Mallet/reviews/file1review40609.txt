review/text: I now know why this product was on 'clearance'. Guess what--it doesn't work. It might be better as a bodywash or air freshner. Because it definently does not clean dishes.My first clue should have been that the bottle warns there is some prep-work involved to using the product. Wanting things to come out 'right' I followed this to the letter.Well, the company might as well not have included it at all. It wastes time. And it does not help the product perform any more efficiently. Nothing was clean when the cycle ended. It looked like I never even ran the dishwasher.I've not had problems with other organic/natural products. Ecos really does itself a BIG financial disservice through such low-quality.
