review/text: I've owned the 8825 xl for about a year now, I used it religiously for the 3 months that it recommends, but not much changed after the initial 4-5 weeks. The sensativity settings are pretty much useless, and I've found that setting it to a &quot;more sensative&quot; setting is actually a little more irritating, as it takes MANY more passes to get the close shave. The built in trimmer is noisy, but otherwise works fine.I previously owned the Norelco Advantage 5615(the one with the Nivea lotion dispenser). I found that the Advantage does a much better job for my sensative face/neck, I wish I would have replaced it with another Advantage. If sensativity isn't an issue, this is a great razor, it cuts VERY close and the battery last for what seems like forever. It's rather robust too, as I've dropped it once or twice in the shower with no apparent damage. If sensativity IS an issue, go with the Norelco Advantage 5615.
