review/text: I have used other proteins before... the flavor was... bland at best, the efeects where not that fast, the glass keepeda lot of residues of the protein once I mixed it, so I gave up on protein till I bought this piece.Not only the flavor (Choco Mint yumm) is strog enough and actually tasty, but I am already seeing the resultsanother thing is that wheneaver i mix, shake, blend it with milk or whatever just rinsing the container removes the fewresidual wastes it leaves behind, I can't help but see the superior quality of the protein. As soon as mine is below 1/4 I am buying another, perhaps a different flavor!I give 10/10
