review/text: Honeyville's oat fiberOat Fiber - 4 Pound Canis a wonderful product for cooking low carb and adding healthy soluble fiber to your diet. It's good for adding to your usual baked goods, making gravy and all kinds of uses. Honeyville also has other wonderful products including almond flour, both blanched and whole, and great powdered eggwhites, freeze-dried fruits and other goodies at reasonable prices. They generally ship without delay and I have found them very good to deal with. You can make wonderful low-carb bread with almond flour, flax seed meal, oat fiber and powdered eggwhites. Try the oat fiber, and try Honeyville. You won't be sorry.
