review/text: Around my house, we call this The Ripper. This is a product for men. Manly, manly men. Men who wear flannel shirts and drink instant coffee and beer from cans.This is not a nose hair removal system (I don't call it a trimmer, and you'll find out why soon enough) for limp-wristed metrosexual prettyboys who squeal with pain when they spill their mochalattechino coffee-like substance on their extended pinkie fingers, because it doesn't just cut the hair. It rips it right out.Ever pulled a nose hair? Ever experienced that very unique burst of sharp pain?Count all the hairs in your nose. Then imagine a tiny version of that big drill-thing from the Schwarzenegger movie "Total Recall" boring into your nostril, grabbing each hair, then tearing it violently from its follicle.That is this what this product does. If you're man enough to remove nose hairs this way, you shall reap the dividends, because a plucked hair takes longer to grow back.If you're a sissy, go with another product... one that simply trims the hairs.
