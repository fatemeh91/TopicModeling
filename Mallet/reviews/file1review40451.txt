review/text: Two stars might seem harsh, but when a superior product is sold in a shoddy container that breaks half way through the useful life of the product what you have is poor value.The lip balm itself is great, but the plastic containers have a tendency to break (the portion of the tube that you must twist to dispense the lip balm breaks off). have had this happen three times. I've googled and read this same criticism made by other users.I exchanged a number of emails with the maker Mode De Vie who asked me to mail back the defective products and promised to send replacements. That was in March 2009; No replacement product has been received at this point.Its a shame because the lip balm itself is my favorite. If the packaging weren't so shoddy I would be posting a Five-Star review. But what good is an excellent product if you can't use half of it without the container failing.UPDATE (08-03-2012): I was posting a new review on Amazon and found this one i'd written 3 years ago. the problems with the failure-prone containers have long since been fixed. now this excellent lip balm is sold in a simpler style of container that doesn't break. i am changing my rating to 4 stars (previously 2 stars).
