review/text: My baby was sitting low giving me extra stomach pain. The doctor suggested I try a maternity belt. After reading several reviews on different products, I chose this at $35. I wish I didn't spend the money. It just didn't provide the relief I was looking for or that others experienced. I was also afraid to pull it tighter for fear of taking too much of the baby's room. I had my doctor look at it and she said I seem to be wearing it correctly but it wasn't providing what I needed.
