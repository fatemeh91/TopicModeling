review/text: Was quite happy with this razor for about 4 months. Then the battery started dying, slowing lasting for shorter and shorter time periods. Eventually it just stopped holding a charge at all. And on top of that, the plug doesn't supply enough power to use the razor, so it's pretty much junk now. Disappointing.
