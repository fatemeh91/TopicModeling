review/text: This little handvac has a lot of suction power and is great for cleaning up dirt and debris in the car. However, the carpet attachment fell apart three days after I had the product. It was pretty easy to put back together since there were no broken pieces but I worry that it will be worse down the line. Emptying it out proved to be a challenge since I had to use a plastic knife to fish out some debris stuck between the opening and where it empties into the reservoir. I think it was worth the price I paid for though...
