review/text: Deet free and works very well! We have a lot of mosquitos because we live in the woods. This spray lotion is very effective in keeping them away. It works best if you rub it in your skin after applying it. It has a strong, but good smell. I've been using it for about 2 years now, ever since discovering it at a Kroger nearby. Works better than anything else I've tried that is deet free.
