review/text: Garden of Life Perfect Food Super Green Formula, 600- Grams (60-Servings):This review is my own personal experience with this vendor & product:I had a Rue-N-Y Gastric Bypass approx. 10 Years ago, so I have a absorption problem to say the least. I have found that this product has helped me as I went from a 390 lb. (approx.) man to a 155-165 lb. man. I now suffer from chronic pain due to the three blown disc's in my lower back. I am now doing what I learned before and I have lost 100 lbs. since last year & working on the extra 50 Lbs. now.If I left it up to work comp. in Ca. which is one of the biggest scams the Government, Ins. Comp.'s,Dr.'s, lawyers, Judges & employers, have ever perpetrated against it's citizens. (really, really,sick to say the very least).I have been left to find my way with the help of my family & friends, so this product & this vendor in my humble experience is helping me. This price is a excellent purchase for this product. This product is exactly what I ordered, in the condition I ordered it and the delivery was here before I expected it.So now draw your own conclusions.Thank you, Jeff.
