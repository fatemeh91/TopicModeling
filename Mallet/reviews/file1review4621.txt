review/text: My wife gave me a Gillette Fusion razor blade prior to my train-up for a deployment to Afghanistan in late 2006. During that deployment, I managed to use the same blade for 20+ days at a time. Did I mention I also shaved my scalp with the same blade....? Since my return home at the end of 2007, I've been getting a month's use per blade on both my face and scalp. I start to get a slight drag after about 20 days or so but, what other razor can give you approximately 15-20 uses for that long? On the 1st of each month, I replace the old blade with a fresh one. The price per pack is expensive ($20+ for each 8-count pack) but, each 8-count pack last me eight months.... You have to admit, that's money well spent.I've used all types of blades starting when I was 15...single, double, triple edge blades...Electric shavers, clippers, and even depilatories(which I loved using except for the time it takes to prepare it, spread it on, wait for it to cure, scrape it off, and wash the excess off my face). I've never had a razor blade that shaved me so close, for so long.To close this review I'd like to add that I've been on Active Duty in the U.S. Army for 24 years, 7 months & 21 days now and will retire in 41 days (June 30th). I will continue to shave my face and scalp with the Gillette Fusion but, I doubt I'll do it as often. I've earned it. Hey, maybe I'll grow a beard and make the razor last two months....
