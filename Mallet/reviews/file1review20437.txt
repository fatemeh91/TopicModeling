review/text: I have purchased several of these cushions after back surgery. The 3 others are oval and seemed adequate until I purchased this one. It is much better for everyday use because it seems to be more supportive of my whole lower body. It also stays in place better as it doesn't shift around on the chairs as much as the oval ones. I will definitely consider purchasing more of these cushions.
