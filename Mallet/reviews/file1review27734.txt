review/text: When I decided to start using whey protein powder, I did extensive research and found ON Whey Gold Standard was reviewed to be the best. And it was. Best taste, best consistency, best protein. I started out at 120 pounds of skin and bones and now I'm a robust 220 pounds and it only took 6 weeks.
