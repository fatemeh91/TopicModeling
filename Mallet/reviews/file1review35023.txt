review/text: I gave a 5 star rating so I don't bring down the average rating, but I have not used it yet. I am considering but this product but the reviews are "It works great!" or "Doesn't work" Which one is it? I have anxiety and I have been using Passion Flower extract, which works well but I saw this product on Dr. Oz today and it seems a lot more convenient! Can someone give me a genuine answer?
