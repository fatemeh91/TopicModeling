review/text: My wife loves this thing. It has allowed me to avoid pleasuring her, she is doing so much better with housework, she is nicer to the children, I gotta say, it works 10 times better than I do. All kidding aside, it **does** work better than I do and it's a ton of fun to watch. It only takes a couple minutes to do the trick and she's a happy camper. I've bought her toys in the past and they have largely remained unused to the best of my knowledge. Not this one. She likes the size, loves the rotating beads, it seems durable, it's allegedly waterproof, and the rabbit ears work their magic better than a rabbit in a hat. I'm very impressed and very satisfied.
