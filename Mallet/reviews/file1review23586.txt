review/text: As advertised, the simplehuman brand trash bags (size K) fit my simplehuman trash can (size K).The handles occasionally rip through the bag if our trash has been especially heavy or if we've been especially delinquent in taking out the garbage.Other than that, yes indeedy! These simplehuman size k liners will fit your simplehuman size k trash can!
