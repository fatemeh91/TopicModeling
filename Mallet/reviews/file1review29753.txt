review/text: I'm normally not one to write reviews, but this product was AWFUL. It arrived today and I put them on immediately. Within one hour the front of my shirt was soaked beneath each breast. My baby is only 5 days old, so it's not like I'm producing large amounts of milk. The pads did not absorb anything. Even when I poured some milk on them to test them, the milk just ran off the pad. I will stick with the disposable by Lansinoh from now on--they can hold milk for hours without leaking--even overnight.
