review/text: I lost my up-close vision after I had cataract surgery at the relatively tender age of 34. I have collected every brand of reading glasses I've come across in the years since and none have impressed me like the Slim Line glasses do. I have a very active life, especially when I'm at work, which causes me to take my readers on and off all day. With the spring hinges on these, they stand up to the abuse I put them through, no problem. They're exceptionally light and they travel so well, I never worry about breaking them--I just hang them on my neckline and go about my business, or put them in their sturdy little metal case. I travel for work, and that means lots of airport security checkpoints and so I often just slip the glasses into a pocket on my bag and I have never had a pair so much as bend, much less break.Unfortunately, my local shopping source discontinued these in favor of another (awful) brand, so I don't shop there anymore. When I came across them in a another store last year during an extended trip, I bought all the pairs they had in my reading strength--and got some strange looks from the cashier. I couldn't say enough great things to her about these glasses!I only buy them now to replace the ones I've left behind in various business trips (drat!), but at the price on Amazon, I may well buy enough to keep me in Slim Lines for several years. Great value!!
