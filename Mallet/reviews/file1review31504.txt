review/text: This is a good product in my opinion, nice size for back packing or for survival usage. This has all the basic items in it needed for cuts, burns, sprains, insects, diarhea, headaches, poison oak and from the items in it, it is possible for it to be used for a gunshot wound, now don't get me wrong, I mean "possible," There is no substitute for professional medical care. Their is much, much more in this bag and has many more uses that would take far to long to write, however, I would recommmend this as a quick use first aid kit for backpacking or survial use.
