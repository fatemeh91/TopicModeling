review/text: I love this product because it gets my dishes sparkling clean with no streaks, spots, or stains. And I don't have to worry about pre-washing my dishes or loading them in any special way because Electrasol does all the work for me. And pairing Electrasol with Jet-Dry was a stroke of genius because you won't have to waste time adding this (can you tell I hate to spend time in the kitchen cleaning.) With the powerful action of Jet-Dry your dishes will be shining spick-and-span clean. I also like the limited edition Jetsons tin it comes in because this is really cute and it can be used to hold other things once your Electrasol is gone. I really do prefer the power balls over the jell balls because the jell balls tend to sick (which can be rather messy when you try to separate them.) The power balls are each wrapped separately in plastic which is very simple to open. Your dishwasher is hungry for Electrasol, so why don't you give it what it wants?
