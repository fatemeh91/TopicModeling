review/text: The best parts:1. No nicks on my face / neck because the multiple blades are very close together so it doesn't "dig" into your skin like the other 2-blade razors. The razors remove your facial hair, but not your skin.2. Precision Blade makes sideburn trimming easy (note: the precision blade is the big difference between the Mach 3 and the Fusion. I threw out my Mach 3 after a month b/c it lacked this feature)3. Pivot-head makes shaving your neck, and the odd chin-to-neck areas very easy.4. The blades last much longer than the 2 or 3 blade systems. There is also an indicator on the blade that tells you when it should be replaced.5. Design of handle makes sense - it just fits in your hand very well, and the whole thing looks pretty nice too.The only negative:1. Blades cost about 30-50 cents more than other blades - but they last a lot longer so this shouldn't matter. Also, it is shaving your face - and isn't 50 cents worth it every 3 weeks?
