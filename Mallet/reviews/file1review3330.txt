review/text: I ordered DHA neuromins (I've tried both 100 mg and 200 mg) to see if they would reduce my vasomotor rhinitis symptoms (uncontrollable sneezing when I get up in the morning, followed by runny nose for ~ 45 min.), and sometimes several more episodes of this throughout the day. They seem to reduce the symptoms, particularly at higher doses (I got as high as 800 mg/day), but not get rid of them completely. On the other hand, unlike fish-based DHA, this has no unpleasant smell or aftertaste at all. They are completely benign gel capsules, easy-to-swallow and inoffensive. An unexpected plus seems to be that I have less of an urge to take a nap in the afternoon while using these, I feel as though I make it through the day without needing to take a cup of tea so I can keep going. So, I'll keep taking these for a few more months to see if the trend continues.
