review/text: I can't stop using this massager. I was going to get the single speed but I'm SO glad I did not. I use it on my knees, my calves and my arms mostly...oh yeah and on my brothers, sister-in-laws and all their kids...I can't seem to find any time now, since they've all had a turn, to use it for myself. For the price this machine is SO worth it...spend the extra money for the variable speed you will be glad you did! Looks like I'll need to get one more for myself now :)
