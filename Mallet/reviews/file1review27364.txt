review/text: I've always liked Optimum Nutrition products, as they use high quality ingredients and overall have good products. So naturally, when I started my new diet/exercise regimen, I knew O.N. would be the protein I would use.I purchased the double rich chocolate, and the flavor is pretty good for a protein powder. It's even better in milk, but I can't currently do that in my diet. Aside from the high quality whey, I like the fact that it has BCAA's, including a significant amount of Glutamine.It's also a good value, although next time I'll go for the 10lb bag, as it's even cheaper.
