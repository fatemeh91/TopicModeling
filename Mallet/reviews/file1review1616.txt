review/text: Spring 2009, I went to a Dermatologist to remove my plantar warts. He suggested the allergic immune response method using DNCB. That stuff is a known mutagen, burned like crazy, ate deep holes in the bottom of my feet, and took six months for me to see any results. I also had to go in the doctor's office every two months to get the 2% solution applied to my warts. Can't remember the exact out-of-pocket expense, but it was way more than $6, and inconvenient. Much to my disappointment, this spring, they all reappearred. I wasn't going back to waste more time and money at the doctor's office. I found this product and decided since it was only $6 and a lot stronger than Compound W that I'd give it a try.I've been using this for 3 weeks max. I swiped a fairly good amount on my warts once a day, then covered the areas with bandaids. First gone was a single plantar wart that came completely off/out. I have mosaic plantar warts on the balls of both feet. I can't see or feel them anymore, but I will continue to apply the Wartstick for another couple of weeks to make sure it removes the layers deep enough to get them out.The only complaint I have about the product is that it's difficult to get it on a single wart without getting it on the adjacent, unaffected skin, but I'll happily put up with a little peeling of some nearby skin to get rid of these warts. The stuff does work! Try it. It's only $6!
