review/text: ok, this stuff definitely is the best deal for l-arginine powder. powder is better than the tabs because the body better absorbs it. of course, the powder doesn't always beet the pills because the body just as often rejects it the same way it went down.you can't change l-arginine into some cherry or bublegum flavored stuff, so for that reason, i'll give now sports a break.outside of the nauseouse taste, very effective...if you can keep it down!
