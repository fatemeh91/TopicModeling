review/text: I am a Police Officer who works night shift and I really need this to keep dark so that I can sleep during the day. I have tried a lot of different masks over the years and this one is by far the best. Other masks bunch and lift up allowing annoying light to get to your eyes. The shape and material of this mask allows minimal light to penetrate and disture my sleep. This is my second sleep mask by this manufacturer ,(the last one was good for 3 years using it nightly), the last one had to be replaced due to wear. I give it 5 stars.
