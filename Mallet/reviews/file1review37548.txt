review/text: My husband and I both agree this sleep mask really keeps out the light, especially important for him since he has to sleep during the day. It takes a little while to get to wearing, but the mask is comfortable with no pressure on your eyes. I don't have any other mask to compare it to, which is why I only rated it 4 stars.
