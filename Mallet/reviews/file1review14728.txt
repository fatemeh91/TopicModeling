review/text: My husband is having knee surgery and needs this assist product when he returns from the hospital. Product is exactly as advertised. I ordered this product on the sixth, was given an arrival date of the seventeenth. It shipped within hours of being ordered and arrived in four days. Very pleased with this seller-OJ Medical.
