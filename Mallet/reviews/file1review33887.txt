review/text: This Stethoscope is perfect for a medical student who wants a strong, durable and affordable stethoscope. It does a great job picking up the high frequencies, but suffers with the lower frequencies which is fine when you're only listening to hearts and lungs on morning rounds. Train on this one, and upgrade when you are a doctor with more funds.
