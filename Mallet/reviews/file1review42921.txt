review/text: This scrub is the best eco-friendly one I've tried and I've been disappointed by many. The smell is pleasant and noticeable but not noxious (I can't handle the scent of the Method bathroom cleaner). My husband cleaned the bathtub with this and was amazed that it seemed to work better than anything else he's tried - and if keeping this on hand means that someone other than me cleans the tub, I'm all for it!
