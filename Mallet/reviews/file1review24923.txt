review/text: My husband and I have been ttc for a few months now. I read up on this product and decided to try it. I was really excited that my cycle was normal after only being off the pill for a month and just thought taking Fertilaid would only help us in trying to get pregnant. I started taking this product about a month and a half ago and did not ovulate this month. I thought at first that maybe it was just me, but now after reading all of the other reviews regarding non-ovulation, I now see what the problem is. If this is supposed to "enhance" your fertility, it should definitely not make it so that you don't ovulate. I bought another month of it a couple of weeks ago, and let me tell you, it's going right in the garbage. I really wish I had known about this problem before I went ahead and wasted my time and money on it. I just hope that it doesn't take long for me to get back on track and start ovulating again. How long has it taken everyone else to be "normal" again??
