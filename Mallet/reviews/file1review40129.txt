review/text: I discovered after receiving this item that the sticky mat is made of 90% PVC (polyvinyl chloride) by contacting Valeo re the product. PVC is dangerous to our health and environment from start to finish - in the factory, at home, and in the trash - releasing poisonous chemicals linked to cancer and birth defects. (I should have checked this prior to purchasing it, that was my error.) My hope is to make other shoppers aware that there are numerous healthy and eco friendly alternatives out there. (Gaiam, Enviromat, Prana, & so many more.) If you are doing yoga for your health and well being than it only makes sense that you are doing it on a material that supports that goal (as well as honoring our planet - PVC is so incongruent with the practice of yoga). Perhaps Valeo will phase it out if enough consumers let them know why they didn't choose their product.
