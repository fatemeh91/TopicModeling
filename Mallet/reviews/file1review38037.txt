review/text: This important device is not just for humans. My dog was successfully revived with this device. The vet subsequently informed me without the aid of this device, my dog would have died. My dog is a 200lb German Shepherd named Lucky, who chewed an electric extention chord =&#62; significant zap!! The device was applied, and 200J later, Lucky got very lucky!! Thank you Philips.
