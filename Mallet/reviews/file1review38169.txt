review/text: I really liked these Always Ultra Maxi Pads. They're very thin but are great for heavy flow as well as light flow. I don't have to worry about leakage. The flexible wings are great because I don't have to worry about the pad moving or getting twisted. I would definitely recommend these pads for heavy and light days, as they're so thin you hardly know you're wearing anything.
