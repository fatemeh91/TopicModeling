review/text: I bought this product thinking of my 12 year old son who has a terrible posture. I always say to him that he looks like the hunchback of Notre Dame.It could be that he is very thin and tall, but this band did nothing. It should have gradual hooks to adjust to different types of bodies. It was too loose and didn't do what it was supposed to do.I tried it, but found it extremely unconftable after a couple of hours.I will not recommend this Posture Band.
