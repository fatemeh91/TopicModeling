review/text: My Ob/Gyn recommended this on my last visit (I am 30 weeks along). I am on my feet for long periods and had commented on back pain. I was using another supporter belt but this one is SO much better. I can feel the difference after only one day. It is a little weird to see the straps under your shirt but well worth it. I love this product. I am petite and would have fit the range of small but I ordered the medium and can fit it fine on the middle hooks or tightest hooks.
