review/text: The first day I took this I thought I was about to pass out.I got real hot and then my ears felt like they needed to pop. My throat felt like it was going shut I was trying to cough and couldn't. Then my neck started itching bad.Then the rest of the day I just had a huge headache.Then that night I felt exhausted! Like I was coming down w/ the flu or something.
