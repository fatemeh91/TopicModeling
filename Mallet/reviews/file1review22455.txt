review/text: I have been using those vitamins for over two years .The fact they do not over load them with vitamin A is a huge plus .As i consume large amount of meet products i do not need to overdose on vitamin A .The pills are quite big with greenish color .It is recommend to take them with some fat ( i do with fish oil and oregano oil ) .This will help some of the vitamins absorb better .Overall its a high quality product .
