review/text: I purchased this product for my seven year old who has not been dry more than one night at a time since birth. Purchasing an alarm as an alternative to medication was highly recommended by our pediatrician. Prior to this point we have tried no liquids several hours before bedtime, waking him up in the middle of the night, etc. Needless to say, we were cautiously hopefull. Unfortunately, the alarm has been very inconsistent. Some nights the alarm sounds, and I am able to assist my son to the bathroom, other nights he wakes up with a wet pull-up and the alarm hasn't made a peep all night. This has been frustrating primarily because my son began to make progress in response to the alarm and started getting up on his own when the alarm sounded. At one point, he was even dry for a period of five days. The inconsistency of the alarm has really hampered progress and we are looking into a more reliable product.
