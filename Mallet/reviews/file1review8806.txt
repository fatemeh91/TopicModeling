review/text: I have tried numerous other "green food" powders over the last couple of years (more on that in a minute), and finally settled on Green Vibrance as the highest quality and overall best among all those I tried.It has 3.5 grams per serving of actual "green foods", which is more than many other green products. It also has many other important herbs and various nutrients, and all in significant enough doses and potentcy to actually work. This is also rich in probiotics and prebiotics, which are also vitally important. Best of all, I actually DO get an energy boost from this product, and notice other signs that it is working, including smoother skin, improved mood, and simply "feeling better".Some of the others I tried:Greens+ - This is another good "green food" product, and if Green Vibrance wasn't available, I would go with this one. Very similar to Green Vibrance, but in my opinion Green Vibrance edges Greens+ out slightly.Green Magma - This product is high-quality as well, but doesn't have quite as many nutrients as Green Vibrance or Greens+.Earth's Promise by Enzymatic Therapy - Pretty good product, but like Green Magma, it doesn't have nearly as many nutrients as Green Vibrance or Greens+.Garden of Life "Perfect Food" - Has more greens, but their products should be avoided at all cost. They are way over-priced, and the founder has one of those mail-order "Doctorate" degrees. (His first book is a real crack-up too, with parts of his biography that don't add up.) In fact, The Amazing Randy (a famous skeptic here in the U.S.) has totally exposed the founder of this company. Do a Google search and you'll find it. Basically, I wouldn't trust ANYTHING this company does or makes.Go buy some Green Vibrance, try it for a couple weeks, and you'll be sold!
