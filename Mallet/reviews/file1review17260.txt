review/text: My husband was complaining one afternoon, after he informed me of smashing his new shaver on the floor of his garage, that he would never find another shaver like the one he's had for years that finally kicked the bucket... I said why would you ruin a new working shaver, just because you didn't like it? We could have at least return it, got his $$ back.. He replied it was worth the $30 to smash that piece of crap on the floor... I asked him why didn't just purchase another Remington like the one he loved. He replied that he couldn't find it and then gave up his search and thought they didn't make them anymore. Well, that's when I come back into the story.I asked for the old one with computer in hand, I &#34;Amazoned&#34; it. Low and behold...BOOM! there it was... a newer model!! (his was pretty old) so like any good wife , I ordered it.. it arrived 2 days later!! free shipping too!! and needless to say... I got me one happy camper again!!! Oh and a nicely trimmed gotee to admire!!! Two words... BUY IT!
