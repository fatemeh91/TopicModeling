review/text: Did everything I expected it to. I bought it on a sale, and just finished it. Low cal, low carbs, low fat. You can find lower of those three with the same whey protein amount, and you can find better quality, but not at this price point.High quality and usable by pretty much anybody. Vanilla, Chocolate Malt and Cookies and Cream are my favorites.
