review/text: I had a difficult time finding just the right Methylcobalamin B-12, for a Neurological "Cocktail" I take;for Neuropathy in my legs. This cocktail was originally formulated for Diabetics; but I have Post Polio Syndrome;and decided to give it a try. What did I have to lose. And remarkably, it does work for me !!!There is more than one form of B-12 (which I didn't know for years). And if youdon't get exactly the right one; your expectations may be less than what you desired.This product is wonderful. It dissolves slowly,under your tongue, as needed.Has a very pleasant berry taste. Not that horrible metallic taste, that cherry flavor often has.I only needed half the dosage twice a day. So, I simply cut them in half, with a pill splitter.A win/win in my book !!
