review/text: We bought a motor home that had some interior roof stains. I dreaded having toclean the ceiling until I heard about Insta Gone. I bought two bottles, whichmakes four 22 oz. bottles, on Amazon. I made up a batch and headed to the motor home, hoping that it would work. OMG! The stains were gone within one hour. I re-applied to the really awful stains a few more times. I have since bought three more bottles that will make six 22 oz. bottles. This stuff really works. You do not have to scrub it, just spray it. Wear a mask and eye gear if you are sensative to the smell. It didn't bother me. This stuff is a must have for stain removal and if you have a camper or motor home you must have this product! I would give this product 10 stars if they would let me. Thanks Insta Gone.
