review/text: This is truly a massage for the gums. I had a sonic care for many years and after it died I went back to to a regular toothbrush. Recently my stepfather had gum surgery(for receding gums) and I was inspired to become more proactive with my oral care. I did research (looking in stores and reading info online) and chose this product. I am VERY happy and feel good about taking care of my teeth and gums. This product is easy to use. FYI:it will keep going until you turn it off. The first time I used it I think I brushed for 5 minutes. I thought it would shut off after 2 minutes, but it doesn't.
