review/text: I have been using the Panasonic wet dry shavers for over 20 years. I have had this model for about a year and it is sounding tired. If you use them in the shower you will get the closests shave possible with no razor burn. The older ones lasted longer but did not shave quite as good. I will start buying the less expense model and replace it when the blades need replacing. I also learned that if you shut the razor off before engaging the side cutter it lasts longer.
