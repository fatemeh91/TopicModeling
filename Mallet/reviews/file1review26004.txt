review/text: This is the only blindfold I know of, of it's type. It is 99.7% lightproof (for me); after having it on for about 20-30 minutes, I can see just the slightest hint of light near the bridge of my nose. It could just be the shape of my face or nose though, and others might not experience this. (Also, the human eye can detect a single photon, or so I've read.)The material is quality. The foam under the plastic &#34;shield&#34; is about 1/2&#34; thick, soft and not itchy or anything. The foam has 2 circle cut-outs for your eyes, so while wearing this, your eyelids/lashes have no material touching or pressing down on them. This for me is one of the things that makes the product so unique. The velcro headband is fully adjustable to get the perfect fit- a sweet spot between tight enough to block out the light, yet not too tight as to be uncomfortable.For the price, comfort, and uniqueness of this product, I have to give it 5 stars. I use mine for meditation, and have been using it for years. I just bought a second one to keep in my car. I have my eyes closed when I use this during meditation, so this product does the job for me. I get to meditate with 0 visual distraction.
