review/text: For my fibromyalgia, my doctor has me on medications, and he recommended that I replace my usual over-the-counter multi-vitamin with Thorne's Meta-Fem because Thorne is an excellent manufacturer and produces very pure products. Additionally, the vitamin and mineral dosages and ratios are much higher than the typical OTCs. 4 in morning; 4 in evening. Combats some side effects from other medications after about 3 months.
