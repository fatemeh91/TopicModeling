review/text: My Polar S720i heartrate monitor battery died and according to Polar, I would have needed to send it back to them for battery replacement. Having read some of the poor reviews about Polar's service department,I decided to attempt the replacement myself. I had read that this battery comes in two different configurations from several manufacturers with the Pannasonic version having a step on the outer diameter and all others missing this step. The only one that actually fits the S720i monitor is the Pannasonic version.The shipment arrived at my home in NY 4 days and I replaced the battery in less than 3 minutes. The Polar website mentions that I would void my warranty if I replace the battery myself (I could not verify the hermetic seal as Polar would have done), but since I do not swim with it and since the warranty had expired two years ago, this was a non issue for me.The battery was received in perfect condition and packaged appropriately.I am a satisfied customer.
