review/text: I was reluctant because of the rating, but the ratings that WERE good convinced me to try them out. They are cheap so even if it didnt work out I wouldnt be upset. Today I finally got around to using them. Boiled water and used tongs to dip them in, pulled it out and blew on it for 2 secs, touched it to make sure it was okay, and then put on my teeth. Bit down a little, but also sucked the air out. (make sure you dont bite too hard, you could definitely bite through them while they're pliable.) They molded really well! I was pleasantly surprised. You can keep dipping them in and remolding until you're happy. Great product.
