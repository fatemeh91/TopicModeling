review/text: Just opened the package. It's exactly what I needed. I tend to forget if I took a particular med even just after I took it cause I'm thinking about other things. Using this product, I will know exactly whether I took my meds that day or not. And it's an attractive product so I'll enjoy using it.In response to what another reviewer wrote, if you lean the open sections against an edge, they lay flat so that you can fill them easily. The only drawback is that when you open the individual section both the am and pm sections are open at once.This product looks like it will work just fine when I need to take my pills along somewhere. The sections snap shut and don't look as if they will open in my purse,(to be sure, I can always place them in a zip lock bag) and yet are easy to open so they won't bounce out upon opening.All in all, I'm very satisfied with my purchase.
