review/text: I was very excited to try this item. But when I opened the tube to apply the wax, it just kept coming out into the lid (what a waste). When I spread the wax on, it did tug a bit at my leg hair. Then, if I didn't rip fast enough, or had too much wax, it felt like I was ripping my skin off. Once I got the right combination of wax application and speed it worked. Overall, it was a little messy. But my legs stayed smooth for a long time. I wonder how many applications you're supposed to get out of this tube. It took quite a few strips to do both my legs. I guess this kit is okay, since waxing lasts a lot longer than shaving and this wax cleans up well. However, the price is so-so for me. How many times I can wax per box will be the biggest factor in whether I buy it again. I'd really recommend it to friends who want to use it for smaller areas, since they could get lots of applications out of one kit.
