review/text: wow. this is my 4th pregnancy and as a physical therapist i've been looking for something supportive. this belt does the trick-it's not flimsy like others out there. I had minimal to no back pain with this pregnancy that I've had in the past-i keep telling everyone that this is my easiest pregnancy and i think I can attribute a lot of that to this belt! It's worth every penny. As someone said in a previous review-it does run biggish. I'm in xl maternity wear and the large did fine. cinch it somewhat tightly so that the belt runs under your belly-i didn't need that ugly top strap either. this is also a summer pregnancy but i don't mind wearing it-being painfree offsets the heat factor. buy it.
