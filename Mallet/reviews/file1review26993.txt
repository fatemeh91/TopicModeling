review/text: I've bought this same product many times from other retailers and it has been great, for some reason, my purchase through amazon (which turned out to be 15$ cheaper when using the subscribe and save discount) has little to no flavor to the powder - it tastes very chemically with a slight hint of chocolate flavor. very disguisting to drink when compared to my past experiences with a dozen bags or so through the years...
