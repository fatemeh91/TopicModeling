review/text: This is the best beard trimmer on the market for the money. I shopped around at Target looking a various trimmers but ended up going with this one. I wanted a trimmer less a billion extra attachments and the greesy oil apply. This trimmer came with 4 items: Trimmer, comb, charger, and one universal attachment. It's works very well, holds a good charge, and best of all no mess. Highly recommend this.
