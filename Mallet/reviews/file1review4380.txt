review/text: I have only used the volume discount throw away razors for 30+ years. Two weeks ago I decided to try the Gillette Fusion. Below is my evaluation:1) very smooth shave2) awkward feel. Too heavy. However, well balanced.3) can't seem to get into tight spots as well as disposable shavers. (IE. under nose, near lips)Summary: I bought 8 replacement cartridges and will give it more time to determine if I stay with the Fusion.
