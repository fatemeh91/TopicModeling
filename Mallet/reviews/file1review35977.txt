review/text: I bought this one at a health store but had to put out the good word. I had Asian food in the Asian part of town where few caucasians go. Quickly into my meal, I realized there were little blue worms, fully cooked into my noodles. Whether it was from poor restaurant hygiene or staged by Asians who don't like American veterans, I got out of there fast and went to the nearest health food store. The vitamin fellow recommended that I take these. You are supposed to take 1 the first day, 3 the second day, 6 the third day and 10 per day until you finish the bottle. I did exactly that and even did a 3 day fast on freshly squeezed lemon juice with water at the end of my treatment. It worked like a charm and I think it got rid of some other parasite that were floating around my intestines, because now I feel great.
