review/text: Great product...been using Afta "Original" for yearsPros: Dosen't burn, smells great...so I'm told, really soothes and protects skin, especially in cold weatherCons: Becomming harder to find (last order via Amazon)....don't know why, several Mennen products (Pre-electric and Fresh scent) are packaged the same and make it easy to pick up the wrong product.....really ticks me off.Other brands that say they are the same......not even close.....don't waste your money.
