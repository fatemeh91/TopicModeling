review/text: I had problems with hemorrhoids for over a year and tried everything on my own before going to the doctor. He told me to get some Polyeth Glycol and a tube of Lidocaine ointment. I use both religiously and my problem abated but the bleeding would not go away. I was getting a bit worried I may have to have surgery but then I read all the reviews about Mayinglong Musk and decided to try the stuff. WOW!!! Within two days the bleeding stopped and so did the pain and worry about using the toilet. Obviously this product might not work for all but for the price why not give it a shot. The only negative is the funky odor but that goes away after a bit and who cares - hemorrhoid relief. The other steps I took was to drink more water and drink 6 OZ of prune juice every day - no more or less. I bought the cream back in Feb and continued with the water and juice regime and everything is great!
