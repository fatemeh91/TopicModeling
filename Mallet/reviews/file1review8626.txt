review/text: I received this product a week ago and already put it to heavy use. My bathrooms and all the tile in the house have not been cleanned for 6 months. So you can imagine. I found this brush very useful.PROS:PriceGets in between tilesCleansCONS:The brush is not durable. If you apply too much pressure it wears off pretty quick. I will get a couple more months out of it but I will have to buy one more later.
