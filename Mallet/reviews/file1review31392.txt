review/text: I had a heel flare up out of nowhere a few months ago and hobbled around in severe pain. After researching a bit on the internet, I discovered that this condition is quite common and easy to remedy by wearing heel cups for several weeks/months.To say these cups were a lifesaver is putting it mildly because I could barely walk. I chose to wear them in both shoes because since they came as a pair, I figured I might as well wear them as a pair. I like that they make me a little taller, too :)Now, I have no more pain and don't even have to wear them anymore. Also, I used these doing yard work and got dirt all in my shoes. These are easily washable right in the kitchen sink. Pretty much only have to rinse them and dirt comes right off.
