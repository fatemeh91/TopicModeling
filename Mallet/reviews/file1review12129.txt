review/text: These prenatals are vegetarian, don't have a lot of weird additives/preservatives, have a small amount of red raspberry leaf and ginger (to "tone" the uterus and help with sickness, respectively), and only need to be taken once a day. They do not have added DHA, but I take MD Formulas OmegaAstin for that. I did not have a lot of problems with morning sickness, but at some point did switch to taking my supplements at night to help with the nausea. Since I never actually threw up (had some close calls, though!) I don't know if these prenatals are better or worse for those with bad morning sickness. These pills are large, and they could be difficult for some people to swallow. I have, however, been happy with them and have not had any deficiencies, etc. throughout my pregnancy. When I reordered I ordered enough so that I can take them during breastfeeding as well.
