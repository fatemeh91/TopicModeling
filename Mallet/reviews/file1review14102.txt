review/text: Our 1 year old daughter has a g-tube and we use this powder to add extra calories to my pumped breastmilk (27 calorie feeds) We tryed preemie infant formula and human milk fortifier and everything else under the sun and it caused her to have excessive gas and malabsorbtion EXCEPT Elecare. The wonderful thing about this powder is that it can be used up until your child is 10 years old, so we will not have to transition her to something else as she grows- just change the amount of powder she gets as she grows and her calorie needs change.It is very pricey however- if your child REALLY needs this, then obviously your child is most likely (or definately SHOULD be ) seeing a pediatric gastroenterologist - try to get this covered on insurance. It smells kinda nasty (luckily she dosnt taste it because it goes through the feeding tube) and you really reallly have to shake up the container/bottle (whatever you use to mix it up in)aggressively to get it to mix without little powdery lumps-otherwise it is just wonderful!
