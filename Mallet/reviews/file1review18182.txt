review/text: If this eye mask actually stayed together I would have given it high marks. But alas.... not so much. The contoured eye pockets are a great design and the fabric patterns really fashionable. All that is inconsequential however, to the fact that after only a few months the interior lining of my eye mask began to separate from the foam. Is it still usable yes. Do I use it... no. I got myself some Eclipse curtains from Khols on sale.
