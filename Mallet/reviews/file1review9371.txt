review/text: I bought this pill organizer because I only take pills in the morning and the evening; some of the pills are large so I needed space; and I was trying to speed up the time it took to take my pills.Positives:1 - It is large enough to hold all my pills, even the large ones.2 - It is easy to identify the day and see if the pills have been used.Negatives:1 - The lid is heavier than the bottom so when I fill them, the bottom is at an angle and the pills can role out.2 - There is only one lid covering both of the two sides. Therefore, in the morning I cannot just tip it over into my hand. Since I have to take the pills out with my fingers and the pills are different sizes, the small pills fall out or to the pills on the night side. It also takes away the time advantage I thought I was getting.3 - It is not very compact.The negatives are very large for me and I will look for another solution. I do not travel for a day or two so taking the individual pods is not an advantage to me.
