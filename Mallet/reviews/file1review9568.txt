review/text: I use the MetRX Protein Plus Creamy Peanut Butter Crisp bars as a meal replacement for breakfast. They are very filling and pack around 30 grams of protein which is great. These bars keep me full for hours. They are not able to withstand the heat at all so just know that if you order them during the summer they will melt during shipment. If you leave one in the car, it will be need to cool off and firm up again but won't be the same. I have had melted bars and they don't compare to the fresh ones you will find at the health food store BUT you get a much better price on Amazon per bar when you order by the box. I love the flavor of these bars and think it is a great product. For that reason, I am giving five stars. As for the melting, storage issue, I send out a warning--buyer beware!
