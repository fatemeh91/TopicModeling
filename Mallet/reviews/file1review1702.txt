review/text: Really like this product. It is really cold in the north-east and I wear socks all the time, even like to sleep with socks and it was making my toes itch. The first time I used this, it stopped the itch. I just put a couple of drops on a small sponge and wash my feet with it. The itch is completely gone. Great product. Will purchase it again.
