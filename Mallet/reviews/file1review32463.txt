review/text: I loved the idea of this bag -- but when I attached it to my 2011 model City Mini Baby Jogger, it just didn't fit. It blocks the under-stroller storage section, and prevented my stroller from collapsing all the way. I returned it and will just use a normal soft-side cooler if and when needed.
