review/text: This bath & shower "gel" was completely watered down. I estimate that it was 25-50% original gel and 50-75% water. I should have known when I saw that this came from a 3rd party vendor instead of the actual manufacturers with Amazon Prime guarantee. When I invert the bottle, the contents squirt out all over the place and do not have a gelatinous consistency as I (and most people) would expect. This a complete rip off, and I will never purchase from them again!
