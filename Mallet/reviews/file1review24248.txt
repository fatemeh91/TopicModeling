review/text: I was consistently having lower back pain. I would visit the chiropractor and feel good for about a week, then the back pain again. I tried Dr. S pads, and they didn't do much. I got the walkfit, and for the first week it felt like I was walking on rocks. Not comfortable at all. After the first week, I got used to wearing them. These made my lower back pain go away. After several months, I stopped wearing them. Recently, I have started having the lower back pain, so I started wearing them again. Again, had to get used to walking on rocks, but again it helped eliminate my lower back pain. I think they are worth purchasing.
