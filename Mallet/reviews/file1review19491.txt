review/text: Before we bought this potty seat, my 2 year old son wouldnt sit on the toilet alone, he always held my hands or had me hold him under his arms so he wouldnt fall in. We got this and he gets it out and puts it on the toilet and goes by himself. The splash gaurd could be a little higher but i taught my little boy to point his "peepee" down so it wouldnt get all over. I love this potty chair because it gives him confidence to use the toilet alone!I would buy for all bathrooms!
