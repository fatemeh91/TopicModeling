review/text: I did a lot of research before purchasing a seat to go on our toilet. I already have a Bjorn stand alone potty but my daughter didn't seem to be comfortable on it for more than a minute or two and she wanted to sit on the big potty but is just too small. So I figured a seat to go on the regular toilet would be the way to go. So far though it hasn't gotten her to go she does seem comfortable sitting on it. The design is really clever and I do believe that it would fit on any seat tightly the way it's adjustable. It's nice to feel comfortable that it's not going to slide around. I think this is definitely the way to go for toilet training.Update 11/21/2011: My daughter is now actually using the seat instead of just sitting on it:) This seat has successfully taught her how to use the potty. We like it so much that for our travels over the holidays we've ordered another seat to be sent to where we'll be spending the holidays so she'll have the exact same seat there. Very happy with this product. Also I've noticed that though she's a girl it's still helpful that this unit has a splash guard on it.
