review/text: I use this all the time, more than I thought I would. I use it for ingrown facial hairs. I'm very happy with it personally. Works well. I'm able to dig hairs out, grab them, and pull them out without causing a lot of damage. The vast majority of the time it works flawlessly. Rarely it may break the hair, or you may have a hair that's hard to grasp(usually because it's very short).It's a very sharp precise fine tipped tool. If you have trouble with such a precise tool than maybe it isn't for you. Just have a look at the product shot, it's exactly what you'd expect it to be. It's well made also, I don't foresee it going bad anytime soon.
