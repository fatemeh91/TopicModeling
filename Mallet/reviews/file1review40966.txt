review/text: I tried this product for the first three days (one patch) and it seemed to work. The problem with its sticking and also the extreme thirst were understandable if not expected, but it caused overall body itching that turned out to be just unbearable! I emailed customer service to ask about this and they couldn't be bothered to reply. Why would they? They're getting enough money from clueless first time customers such as myself to a) acknowledge and research the side effects their product DOES cause, or b) share the possible causes of the itching in certain people, if they know.Here's some more things that sucked about the product: I was exercising regularly when I started using it. But then I started to get winded within five minutes to the point of stopping my exercise. Also, I definitely couldn't fall asleep easily so I started a take the patch off immediately after work rule. That was much better than waking up at 3 in the morning to feel my heart racing!As for the good parts, it did suppress my appetite. It was weird, I'd crave all kinds of foods like normal, but when I'd go to get something to eat I'd only get one serving of one thing and be satisfied. The energy level (or restlessness. Or "jitters") I got from using the product was really quite the something. Before I started, my apartment was really in an ignored state due to tiredness after work. That first day, I worked a 14 hour day -- rare for me -- and came back and scrubbed my entire apartment clean! While all that was pretty impressive, it just didn't make up for jumping up and slapping and scratching myself throughout the day (and at work, nonetheless) like some kind of idiot. Sitting still was no easy feat!I won't use this product again until I figure out how to deal with the itching.
