review/text: According to this thermometer my husband had a temp of 100.8 for a couple of days... After violent shaking and chills, we finally decided to go to the Urgent Care, they said his temp was actually 104! We double checked the Vicks when we got back home (5 minutes), and yep, it still said 100.8.
