review/text: I have checked the accuracy of this blood pressure monitor with ones in stores, doctors office, etc. It is usually pretty close to accurate although may show a little high at times. I made the mistake of getting the average arm cuff - if I had to do it over again, would probably get the larger one as if I don't hook it just right it will pop loose when pumping up. All in all, not a bad little monitor
