review/text: I've always wanted to be a runner but whenever I'd give it a try I'd get terrible shin splints. I just started the c25K running program and I must say that this product is invaluable to me. As soon is my run is over I put these on (I purchased 2), stretch and put my feet up. So far no soreness or inflammation. In just a few short weeks I should be able to run a 5k and I don't think I could do it without these!
