review/text: I've been using my old Norelco shaver for the past 5 years. I didn't like it because my skin on my face would get irritated after every shave that I literally would go on for several days in between each shave. It also did not shave as close as I would like. To keep the blade decent, I had to clean it on regular basis and it too was a hassle. My wife just bought me the 8585 shaver for a Father's day gift. I was skeptical at first and the price was a bit higher than what I would like to spend. But after my first and second shave with it, the only word I can truly express is "WOW". This shaver is excellent. It shaved as close as a blade with no irritation. I read of some reviewers complaint of not able to get a close shave around the base of the neck area. I found that by merely turning the shaver to angle it, I was able to shave the base of the neck area just fine. The self cleaning system is great. I no longer have to worry about taking the shaver apart to clean it.
