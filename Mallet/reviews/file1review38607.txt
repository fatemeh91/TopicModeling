review/text: First things first -- I don't know about you, but I LIKE waiting for my coughdrops for a week in the mail. I think that's the way God intended it, and if you disagree then you are nothing but a stupid atheist and I hate you.On to the drops: Mentho-Lyptus? MENTHO-TACULAR!!!! Cough no more with these sweet puppies. I should warn you, however, that the wrapper is kind of tough to get off sometimes. I know it may seem impossible sometimes, but if you stick with it and I promise you'll get it down. Once these babies are unwrapped, it's GO TIME!!!!
