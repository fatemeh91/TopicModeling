review/text: If you want to look incredibly sexy in the bedroom, there are two ways to go: there's lingerie and there's bare skin and jewelry. When you go with the jewelry, put on your most exciting jewelry and knock him dead! A wildly exciting form of jewelry is the nipple ring, but if you are like me, you do NOT want get pierced in such a sensitive part of your anatomy. Well, these nipple rings are for you!Gold, with an attractive crystal bead, these rings clip on to your nipple with a rather stimulating feel, making you look hotter and feel hotter in your bedroom jewelry ensemble.Two words of advice. First of all: if for any reason these rings will not stay gripped to your nipples for long enough, simply pull lightly on your nipple, and attach the ring right behind it. Secondly, if these rings are painfully tight, then just pull them open far enough to decrease the pressure.(Review of California Exotics / Swedish Erotica Gold Non-Piercing Nipple Rings with White Crystal)
