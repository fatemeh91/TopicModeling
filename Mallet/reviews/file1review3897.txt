review/text: years ago when the original whitestrips first came out, i tried them. i had great results and the whitening actually lasted longer than i had expected. fastforward a handful of years and i have decided to try the premium strips. i'm getting braces in a month, and i wanted quick results that would last at least through a portion of my treatment. i used the premium strips for 30mins lastnight and i had amazing results from only one strip! if my teeth keep whitening like this, i will have to stop using them before the box is done to prevent having the unnatural 'hollywood glow'. i was blown away!
