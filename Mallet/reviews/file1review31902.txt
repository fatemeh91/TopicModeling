review/text: I knew something was not right with my digestion...for years, even decades I had constant food cravings and abdominal pain. My doctor could find nothing wrong, he used MRI, bariun enema, x ray, to no avail.My weight had been going up along with my age, here i was.. 260# 60yo.I looked on the web for any advise or help. I found Garden Of Life digestive enzymes and their probiotics... Within a day my food cravings began to lessen and my gut pain subsided. After two weeks the situatuion is getting even better.. I have a normal appetite, I feel full after a modest meal and I am actually able to walk past delicious food because I am not hungry. Believe me I ALWAYS ate everything before.Maybe the resutls are not the same with all people, but these products sertainly work for me.Update, MAY 2011, I am still using this product will the same great results.
