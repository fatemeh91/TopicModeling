review/text: I now own two of these - not because one broke, but because I left one at home while going on vacation and couldn't live without it. A lot can be said about a trimmer that works well and is inexpensive enough to order an additional one without hesitation. The only addition I would make to it is the use of a lithium battery and smart charger.A solid buy you won't regret.
