review/text: Caution:Norelco tells you to replace the heads every 12 months, however, that can be excessive in some situations. If you use your Advantage shaver in a dry mode (without lubricant), then replacing the heads yearly is about accurate. However, what Norelco doesn't tell you (and the reason why most people buy an Advantage) is that if you use this shaver when your face is warm and wet (i.e. shaving in the shower) then you can easily go 2 years without replacing the cutters.The reason for this is because dry shaving with an electric razor is extremely hard on any blade (not just these ones). By warming and wetting your face and whiskers with water and a lubricant (there are many to choose from), you can decrease blade wear by about 60%! It's also much less traumatic on your face.Skin Care Tip:If you're concerned about healthy skin, skin cancer, and/or want to keep your skin looking young as you get older, it's best to apply an after shave lotion with SPF shortly after the shave, while your pores are still open. Oh, and you need to do it every day, not just on days that you shave. Pay the extra and get an after shave lotion with SPF and NOT a big bottle of generic sun block; you just might end up smelling like coconuts. The lotion can be a little pricey when you see the size of the bottle you get for your money, but just remember what your buying it for. And lastly, and this is VERY important, make sure that it blocks both UVA and UVB; not all of them do.
