review/text: The upper right quadrant of my back is really messed up, with a couple of major pain trigger points. One of my best friends had one of these and I had toyed around with it a few times and was impressed with how effective it was. Then a few months ago I started getting regular manipulations from a doctor. She recommended that I get a Body Back Buddy to help loosen up my back and shoulder. Along with a roller foam that I use to help arch my back a bit, it has helped reduce the pain in my back.I frankly can't imagine anyone not wanting one of these. If you have pain, it will help you deal with it. But even if you don't have any spots where you have actual pain, it will help you relax and stretch. And heck, it just feels good. And the Body Back Buddy is so well designed that it can be adapted for just about any spot on your body, from the arch of your feel to your upper or lower back, to your calves, to the back of your neck, to your upper shoulders. I strongly recommend using the BBB in conjunction with one of the books available about pressure points.You should definitely get one of these. Yes, they work. A bargain for the price.One other thing. There is a similar product, the Theracane. I have toyed around with both. I definitely recommend the Body Back Buddy over the Theracane for a couple of reasons. One is that the double hooks, one ending in a ball and the other ending in a sharper point, to give very different kinds of pressure points. I just found that you could do more things with the BBB than the Theracane. Though frankly, either is going to do your body a lot of good.
