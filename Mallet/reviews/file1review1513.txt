review/text: I bought this because of all the great reviews I read. I have to say, it is amazing stuff. It is like chapstick. You take a toothpick (or in my case, a floss stick) and place a little dot/chunk on the wart. I put it on my son's wart (Palm) and cover it with a bandaid before bed. After maybe just 5 nights, the wart scabbed off!! It did not go away completely, so I waited a week to let the redness go away and I am going to start again, but I think it is a great product! He is only 5 years old and he has never complained about it burning or hurting his palm, so I am not afraid to mash it on there and cover it with a small patch band-aid. Major Results guaranteed!! I will review again once the wart is completely gone, but I wanted to make certain he didn't irritate the skin surrounding the wart too much before we started another round of treatments!
