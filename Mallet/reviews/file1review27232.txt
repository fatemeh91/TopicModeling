review/text: I bought the Whey Gold Standard Double Rich Chocolate on the recommendation of a friend. While I know that everyone says GNC is way overpriced, I've been using their Wheybolic AMP 60 for a long time and have been very happy with it, both in terms of taste and performance. The Gold Standard is just as good in terms of performance/recovery as far as I can tell. It's less expensive, but there is pretty much no taste. This isn't a big deal to me, but some people might care. The good news is that it doesn't taste bad, it just doesn't taste like much at all.I'll probably continue to buy it, although I may buy both this and GNC's AMP 60 and just mix them together and blend both the supplements and the price. That's typically what I've done in the past with different protein powders while transitioning anyway, but I thought I'd try this on its own so I could write a fair review of it first. Where this product works really well is if you want to mix it into food, like oatmeal. It doesn't really affect the taste that much, whereas most other protein powders I've used would be pretty noticeable if mixed with oatmeal.Hope this helps someone.
