review/text: My husband uses this one and likes it. The pill pods are easy to read and easy to carry one day's pills in your pocket. The pods are not secure in the stand - it is just a stand. If you want something for traveling, these are a little unhandy. It all depends on what you need. I think this one is the best for use at home.
