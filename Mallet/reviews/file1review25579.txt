review/text: This trimmer works great. I use it in my ears and it cuts the hairs very close to the skin without any tugging. It's remarkably quiet (which is a big plus when a motor gets up close and personal with your eardrum). I've used it every other day for a month now and the battery hasn't drained a bit. It feels solidly built and is easy to grip. I couldn't be happier.
