review/text: I have 2 Miniature Schnauzers with bladder and kidney stones. I decided to purchase pH test strips to monitor their urine at home rather than paying $22 each time at the veterinarian's office, especially since one has become very ill and requires daily testing and subcutaneous fluid replacement based on the results of pH and specific gravity testing of her first morning urine. I've tried several kinds and so far this is the most accurate and easy to use.Ph Test Strips Dispenser - .2 Intervals for Accurate Saliva or Urine PH Testing - Immediate ResultsThere's another type that a first seemed more economical because it came with 2 sets of tape, but the increments were 0.5 instead of this one's 0.2 increments, so for Leilani's sake this is better for her management.Pros for this item are:* The item description is correct; the results are immediate.* Results are the same as testing done at the vet's lab.* Less vet visits for the dogs; the vet and I have set up protocols for how much fluid to give based on the results, so it saves me $$$ in the long run.* The 0.2 increments allow better management of their treatment than guessing at the 0.5 measurements, as well as accuracy comparable to lab results* Refills are available through Amazon.Cons: only one at this point:* You have to make sure the tape stays dry and isn't exposed to moisture, which could affect the results. It was easy to spot when it first happened because the exposed part was lighter in color than normal; I just store it in a plastic bag to keep out moisture.
