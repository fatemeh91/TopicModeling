review/text: My MB-200 worked well for a few years, but then the rubberized grips on the sides deteriorated into a sticky mess for no apparent reason. On top of this, the battery is NiCad, and is now failing - it only holds its charge for about a day. To make things worse, you *have* to charge the battery to use it; even if your battery is weak and you plug it into the wall, it will still only run off of battery power. Other reviewers have already pointed out that the battery is non-replaceable; yet another reason why I will likely choose a different model to replace my failing MB-200.
