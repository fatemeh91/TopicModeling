review/text: I purchased this product to combat the orange stains in my dishwasher due to the high iron content in our well water. My dishwasher was quite thoroughly and deeply stained after 2 years of use with the iron contaminated water. I followed the directions precisely (opening the bottle and just putting it upside down in the silverware basket), ran the dishwasher once, and voila! ALL my iron stains DISAPPEARED. It was beautiful. Now, approx. 8 months later, even though my other water usage appliances are still receiving iron stains from the water (after cleaning with other products), I find that my dishwasher is still sparkling white. I am wondering if there is possibly some agent included that helps resist staining for a short period of time.At any rate, I highly recommend this product if you have iron staining your dishwasher. A great product at a great price!!
