review/text: I bought these at the grocery store and I guess they weren't selling well because they expired about two months later. I'm not sure if they were less effective being after the expiration date, but I still used them and saw some improvement. I have a keyloid on my shoulder that's been there for years, so seeing any improvement was a pleasant surprise.I've read some of the reviews that indicate a problem with sticking and I would have to disagree. If I was sweating during a workout or yard work or something, I didn't bother putting one on. I could however sleep with it on and washing it helped to keep it sticky, which really surprised me.All-in-all, it's a product with a few flaws, but nothing too terrible. It's biggest drawback in my opinion is the inability to stay on in some cases, but it works for me overall since I'd plan ahead on using it, so no big deal. I'll be buying another box in the hopes that it doesn't expire too soon and will be more effective. Hope this review helps.
