review/text: I have tasted other Gold Standard Whey Protein flavors and they were great. This is the first time I try Vanilla Ice Cream. Sad to say it has a bit of a chemical taste. I have to drink it really fast so I dont taste the &#34;chemical&#34; taste. Im still taking it as it is Whey Protein, but I dont get to enjoy this Protein Shake.
