review/text: I had a bunch of plantars warts on my heel that had been there for a while and just kept multiplying. I was under the impression that they had to be removed by a doctor, until I saw this product. I immediately ordered it and began using it religiously. A couple weeks passed and I didn't see a change in the warts. The skin around them wasn't looking so good, but the warts were still thriving. I read online that a lot of people have luck with apple cider vinegar, so I tried that. MUCH better results. Forget this product, just go to the store and get some ACV, cotton balls and duct tape.
