review/text: I bought it because it said its from global healing but I just received mine and it said its from some Chinese guy. I'm VERY SKEPTICAL when it comes to things that are from China. They are the country of replica. Last time I bought my oxy-powder, Im pretty sure it was in a larger bottle although it was 120 capsules. This new oxy-powder I received today, the expiration date has been smudged. I'm giving more stars than I should only because I'm not 100% sure if this is legit or not. I hope this is legit.
