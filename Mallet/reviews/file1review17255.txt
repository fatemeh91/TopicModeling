review/text: Feels cheap and does not perform well. Also, the battery doesn't hold much of a charge - not enough to get a full trim finished. I could live with that if it would run from just being plugged in, but it doesn't do that either. I'm throwing this one out (bought a little over a year ago) and looking for something that works.
