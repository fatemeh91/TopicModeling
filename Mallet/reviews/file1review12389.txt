review/text: My husband was recommended this because "it works way better than Pepto" and it really does.At first I had a hard time getting passed the consistency which is white and almost gelatinous and frankly looks perverse.My husband uses it any time he has stomach issues and convinced me to try it the last time I had a problem and it cleared up within a couple of minutes with none of the after-issues that Pepto usually has. I have to admit he was right about it.
