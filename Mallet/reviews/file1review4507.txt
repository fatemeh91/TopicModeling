review/text: My aunt is a notorious coupon clipper and she got one of these for free which she gave to me(bless her heart). At first i was thinking who really needs 5 blades? I thought that was overkill but i gave it a try when i ran out of blades for my mach 3. The shave was very close with much less irritation and i wasn't even using my favorite shaving cream (Kiss my Face), i was VERY impressed to say the least. I hate to shave at the best of times but the Fusion makes it very easy to get a close shave and i no longer have to go against the grain to get down to bare skin which is a necessity for those "intimate" moments.
