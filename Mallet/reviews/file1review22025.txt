review/text: I was looking for a natural product for coughs and all my research led me to Enzymatic Therapy. It works great with our 5 year old if he starts to get a cough. Soothes the bronchial passage and soothes coughs! I highly recommend you try this product. It works great with our 5 year old if he starts to get a cough.
