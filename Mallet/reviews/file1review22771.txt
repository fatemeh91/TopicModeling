review/text: I was pumped to try this as it was a great price compared to in store pricing (45.99+ tax) and because of the great reviews..I realized after the first couple of days of taking the pills that they were literally making me sick.. like almost to the point of vomiting.I then found that if I ignore the instructions to take the pills 30 minutes before eating, that the feelings of nausea didn't happen..Whether or not my results were affected negatively because of that I don't know, but it was the only way I was able to continue taking the pills, so be aware.I'm actually wondering if the nausea is part of the appetite supressant, like it triggers the same mechanism that makes you not want to eat. ??Overall, I feel like I did have increased energy, and definately found the appetite supressant to help. Even though my diet was pretty clean during the week (only really splurging on the weekends) I didn't notice a huge difference in stomach fat reduction. But I did notice some, and my wife has even.commented a few times that she sees more definition.Also my wife noticed thay I was irritable while taking the pills... Which I read in another review too.Honestly, by the end of the first cycle I was so ready to stop taking them. They just made me feel funny.I may research a little more what each pill does so that I can leave out the ones I feel are causing me issues before starting another cycle.. which I do plan on doing because of the definition improvement and weight loss (4 lbs)Even though I had issues, I think they work, so I would recommend them.
