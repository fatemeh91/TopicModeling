review/text: These Shin Ice sleeves are a great idea, however I think buyers should be aware of a couple of things... Definitely buy a size larger than you think you will need. These are very hard to pull on, especially when frozen. There is much too little "ice" in the sleeves. Not nearly enough to give shins a good icing for 15 minutes. Loses coolness rather quickly.
