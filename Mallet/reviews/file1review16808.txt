review/text: Replacement batteries are not inherently exciting. Wait a minute, hold the phone! They shouldn't be. They should simply fit into the intended devices without hassle, power them up effectively, and last for a long time. That's exactly what the Streamlight (remarketed Energizer) AAAA batteries do. They make my Streamlight gleam and they allow my cats to chase my laser pointer's spot for hours on end. It's too bad that all consumer products don't work this unobtrusively and well!
