review/text: I love this sleep mask. I've had the brown one for a few years and wanted a change so I ordered the "waves" pattern. It blocks out all the light and I like that I can blink when I'm wearing it. It's super light so you don't even notice wearing it. I've also given this mask as a gift to several people and they love it as well.
