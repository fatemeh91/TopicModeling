review/text: I started taking Gingko a few years ago when I noticed I wasn't as quick on the draw at work. I had read a lot of good things about it and knowing it's a natural based supplement decided it couldn't hurt to try. There was noticable improvement for me within the first couple weeks. I was more focused and my memory wasn't as hazy; there was clarity instead of fog. The fog had been building for awhile so I was happy to see it diminish with the ginkgo.Another boost came in the energy department. As I hit my late 30s, the extra push to get all my necessary work and life stuff done had become a battle. Ginkgo helped me to relieve a lot of that fight which was awesome. I had turned a co-worker onto the stuff as well and she actually came back to me to tell me how much it helped her, but that she'd found an even bigger boost when she took the ginkgo in conjunction with ginseng (Ginseng Complex Plus Royal Jelly (1000 Mg) + FREE Ginkgo Biloba Extract (30 Mg) 60 Tablets). At her suggestion I gave it a try and wow- all the positive effects were enhanced tenfold! My recollection skills are as clear as they where when I was a teenager and there's no longer a fight to clean the house or cook dinner after work; I have enough energy to do it all.I'm definitely a more efficient and effective person when I take my supplements. Between the ginkgo and ginseng, I doubt I could be any better at what I do than I am now. I highly recommend it to any and all working people with brain overload!
