review/text: After reading so many positive reviews on this razor, I decided to get one and found out that I was lucky to get the Merkur HD. The #178 is the model number given in another part of the globe. This is the same as the Merkur HD or 34c.The razor is made with precision and finesse. It is so heavy that it shaves with just its weight gliding down the face. Very sturdy and it looks all set to last a lifetime.The shaves itself are so close that some care has to be taken initially as there is a little learning curve. But it is a beautifully balanced razor. Excellent product!
