review/text: Remember the song lyric "Down on your heels, up on your toes...?" That's not only part of a dance step but it's a great way to apply this ultra soothing, smoothing foot cream. It doesn't take much at all and feels wonderful to rub this rich cream around and under heels then up through the soles and toes.Lanolin. Vitamin E, Sunflower Oil, Paraffin, and Glycerin are all part of the mix that changes rough underpinnings to soft, silky, prettier feet. I've tried everything from baby oil to a variety of body butters, and nothing does the trick like this cream.
