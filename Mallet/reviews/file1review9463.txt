review/text: First off, the product description is a tad misleading. This product DOES have a noticeable scent of lavender oil due to it being an ingredient in the cream; "noticeable" meaning the smell is apparent when opening the tub and while brushing on your skin, but not after this point. This may bother some that are sensitive to scent. Before using this product, personal taste prompted me to avoid products scented with lavender as they tended to be very, VERY strong. This is not so with this product. Rather, Truefitt & Hill Ultimate Shaving Cream walks a fine line between mysteriously relaxing, present but not oppressive, and a source of live-wire masculinity that most often miss. What is more, this is a fantastic product to shave with. Use a decent amount in your shave and this product will yield a great shave and leave your skin notoriously smooth. Case in point, this product has allowed me to shave half as much as I normally would with a disposable razor due to the close shave it facilitates. Correct shaving procedure dictates to never shave against the grain, yet it is possible to do so with this product and receive a very comfortable shave. Shaving with the grain, re-lathering, and shaving with/across the grain will yield one just as comfortable. For anyone beginning to shave with a quality cream or for a first-time safety razor user, this product is strongly recommended as a gateway to the ultimate shaving experience.
