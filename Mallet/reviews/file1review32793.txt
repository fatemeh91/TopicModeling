review/text: I bought this meal replacement looking for a way to lose weight. It doesn't have a whole lot of substance to it, I didn't minde the flavor ( french vanilla) Def a good buy for the price. I have had better success with another product, for anyone who looks to lose some wieght, I lost almost 18lb of fat in one cycle with this, I am lean guy, so 18lb was alot!Advocare 24 Day Challenge Weight Loss System
