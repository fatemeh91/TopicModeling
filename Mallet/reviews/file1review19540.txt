review/text: Love this seat. With the cheaper seats w/ Disney designs, etc, the pee was always getting everywhere but the potty. This is perfect for my son. The bump between the thighs keeps his legs apart so pee gets IN the potty instead of on it and it is deep enough so that even if the pee does not go straight down and still gets in the potty and does not leak under the seat. Fits well on our toilet seat.
