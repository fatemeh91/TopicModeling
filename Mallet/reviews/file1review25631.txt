review/text: My husband has been using a small pair of scissors for years to cut his nasal and ear hair and always worried that he would gouge a hole in his nose especially from a sharp move--after using the groomer one time, he is soooooooooooooo happy I bought it--he is very comfortable with it and sees nothing but a wonderful grooming experience with it! Highly recommend this groomer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
