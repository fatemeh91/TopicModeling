review/text: We bought our Bjorn seat over 6 months ago from this site. It works great on our elongated Toto seats (approximately 4-5 years old)--it just sits on the Toto seat and the rubber on the Bjorn seat keeps it from sliding around. Just make sure that the adjusters (manually adjustable) under the Bjorn seat near the handle are the right width to fit between the sides of the Toto seat. My son (3 years old as of yesterday) can get on and off by himself without the Bjorn seat shifting or sliding--the slight inward tilt of the Toto seat helps to keep the Bjorn seat extremely stable. The Bjorn seat is extremely comfortable for my boy, and is very easy to clean.
