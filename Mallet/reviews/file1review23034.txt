review/text: I moved out of a house and had to do one last cleaning of the carpets, sadly I had the power turned off a day before and didn't plan ahead...I got on amazon and had this shipped overnight to me hoping it would work. I had to clean both carpet and hardwood floors, with no power.I am pleased to say it worked really well. It did NOT get 100% of the lint on the carpet up on the first pass, but after several passes the floors were cleaned. I had no issues with the handle coming off, I did however have to empty the trays on this several times which was a great thing!I even tested this on hardwood floors. It got everything up I went over including safety pins that were on the floor.Does this do the same quality of a powered vacuum? Nope, but it does a great job for a non-powered, simple sweeper. I would buy it again if I needed another one, but since it's so portable, lightweight, etc. I don't need another one, I can just carry this one around as I need it.
