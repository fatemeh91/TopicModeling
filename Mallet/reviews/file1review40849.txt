review/text: We have been using Bright Spark and Focus Formula together, for my 9 year-old nephew who had been diagnosed with ADHD and displayed impulsive outbursts of anger and trouble at school. He has been using these two products for about 5 weeks now and we have seen a marked improvement in his behavior. He seems to be much more able to handle situations that previously would have escalated into destructive behavior and defiant attitudes toward authority. Just prior to starting him on the Bright Spark and Focus Formula, he had been taken off an ADHD medicine because of a reaction to it, which was not doing anything to control his behavior anyway.I would recommend trying this combination, especially if you are having doubts about the safety and efficacy of your current ADHD meds.
