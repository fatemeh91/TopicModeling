review/text: We both tried different positioning in our ears to get an accurate readout on this thing, probably tried it 50 times each. Never got similar readings and never higher than 96-something, which isn't possible. Coulnd't return this thing because the time limit is 30 days from date of purchase. Waste on money and time.
