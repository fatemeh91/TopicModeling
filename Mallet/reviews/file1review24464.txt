review/text: Often it's hard to tell if an herbal product is doing anything. Not this one. I've read that Vitex isn't for everyone, and it's contra-indicated for those on clomid, but I was having a very short luteal phase (6-8 days) and the first month my LP went to 11 days, then settled at 12-13 days. I also felt like I had more energy and this may sound crazy, but mosquitos leave me alone (I read somewhere that this might happen and it did!) Please talk to your doctor, acupuncturist, or naturopath before using as some ladies have reported not ovulating at all!
