review/text: i use this for my nose hair. its great. it takes 1 AA battery. just stick it one of your nostrils and go to town. u can press it up against your nose, but dont push it too hard. youll feel a little tickle. doesnt hurt at all. its just doing its job. its great! i love it! wont take more than a minute or 2. but now i can breathe smooth and freely! sweet.
