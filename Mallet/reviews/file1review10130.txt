review/text: Our doctor gave us suppositories after my son would projectile vomit all liquid tylenol. About 30 minutes after he gets one he's happy and will normally take a nap. These have been such a life saver while my poor baby's molars have been breaking through! I consider these a must-have baby item. Just make sure the dosing is appropriate with your child's weight. Our doctor told us to bump up to the 120mg (we were using 80mg before.) I don't think there's any dose lower than 80mg however.Feverall is by far the best brand as well. They don't have any recalls like some of the other brands and their packaging is the easiest to open. The CVS brand was impossible to open and I would often have to get scissors and try to salvage the dose. We always use Feverall now.
