review/text: I have used this product for several years and loved it prior to their "New Formulation ". It previously had a pleasant, slightly sweet, natural vanilla flavor - I drank it in water and actually enjoyed the flavor. Now the flavor is a nauseating artificial caramel flavor - even though it still says natural vanilla flavor. I can't really taste any vanilla at all and it is sickeningly sweet. The old formula also dissolved quickly and perfectly, now it dissolves into stringy lumps. And probably the biggest disappointment - they have added soy. I have a soy intolerance - which causes abdominal pain and nausea (originally diagnosed as IBS). I did not think to read the ingredient label since I have been using the product for so many years, but when the abdominal pain returned, I started reviewing everything I was consuming and found the newly added soy. I am so disappointed to lose a long loved product. And now I am stuck with two very expensive 32 oz cans. I don't understand why you fix something that is not broken. Solgar needs to realize that people who take this product are generally healthy people who are not hooked on cheap sugary artificial products. So, be aware that the majority of the high ratings are from before the "New Formulation". Now the search begins for another protein powder that is soy free.
