review/text: I used a Mach 3 for years and was satisfied. I was reluctant to try the fusion, but a sample was included with my morning paper delivery a year ago, who would have thought to include it with the paper?Anyway, after using the first razor and cartridge, the closeness of the shave was incredible! I used it for almost 3 months before having to bite the bullet and buy cartridges.The shave from this razor is incredibly close, with no irritation. My beard grows every which way, leading to some discomfort with single or twin blade cartridges. This shaver, while refills can be expensive, provided a closeness in the shave I have never experienced before.I have achieved a longer use per refill, partly I think, because I do not use a traditional shave cream. I use "Kiss my Face" shave cream, which does tend to extend the life of the cartridge, while also providing a better and closer shave, with far less irritation.If you use this, try different shave creams, and be sure to thoroughly dry the cartridge between uses. This will help to lengthen the life of the cartridges.One caveat... my beard is not thick, and I do sport a goatee, which may also help with longevity of cartridges. I currently use one cartridge every six weeks or so.
