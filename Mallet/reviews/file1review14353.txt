review/text: After replacing my son's twin mattress several times over the past three years I finally gave up on fancier mattress pads and went with this simple solution. He wets the bed several times a week and though the fifty dollar mattress cover suggested by the mattress store was comfortable it wasn't protecting the mattress and as a result there was a continual smell in his room. And after many, many launderings the fancy mattress cover grew increasingly porous and began to shred. This cover is completely waterproof, amply cut, and sponges clean. It is slightly more crumply or crinkly than a higher tech model but it's not at all uncomfortable and it gets the job done! Very happy with it; sometimes simpler is better.
