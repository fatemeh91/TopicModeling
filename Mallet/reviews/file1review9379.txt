review/text: I love these pill packs for each day of the week labeled am and pm. I can put one pack in my purse for the day and it stays securely closed none of the pills fall out. It comes with a thick plastic tray so you can put all the pill cases in it. Each case can hold about twelve large vitamins and fifty small pills. The cases are made of hard sturdy plastic and they are easy to clean. They are labeled Monday-Friday for a weeks worth of pills or whatever you want to use them for.
