review/text: I bought these boots for my girlfriend for Christmas. She has some issues with circulation to her feet (Reynauld's syndrome) and they are always cold at night. She heats up these boots and wears them to bed every night now. They keep her feet warm and help her get to sleep. They have become an integral part of her night-time routine! She also enjoys the pleasant herbal scent that is emitted by these boots when they are heated.These boots are one size fits all. Since the boots are really a glorified sock and you won't be walking in them, they should accomodate almost all foot sizes.All in all, if you (or someone you know) have a problem with cold feet, these boots are what you have been looking for.
