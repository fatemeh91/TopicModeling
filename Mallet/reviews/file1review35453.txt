review/text: My dishwasher was definitely what could be considered, an ULTIMATE challenge. Well water ... that says it all. The inside of my dishwasher was completely rust-colored, and after using this product once, it was like brand spanking new. I was shocked, surprised, and exuberant about the results. You won't be disappointed.
