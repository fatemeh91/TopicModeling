review/text: Admittedly, I've only had this product for a few days but this thing is great. The reason I had to buy it was because I accidentally dropped my last trimmer and it landed on its head and broke. It was time for a new one anyway. Funny thing is, when I opened the package for this trimmer, I did the exact same thing and dropped it (I'm normally not this clumsy, I swear). I was nervous to see the damage but there was none at all. This thing has a nice weight and feel, is obviously pretty durable, and the feature for the adjustable hair length is awesome. My last trimmer had separate attachments which proved to be a real pain so this was a great improvement. It takes about two or three passes to get my beard exactly how I'd like but I have yet to feel any pulls or tugs. Overall, this is a great value and I would definitely recommend it.
