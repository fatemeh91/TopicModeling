review/text: I have 12 pairs of readers in my home, one or two in every room. I have bought some from dollar stores (very cheap) and most from drugstores. These are superior to all and very well and strudy construction. They are also more stylish, easy to clean and comfortable, highly recommended and I will be buying more soon!Update: Loved hem so much,I just bought another 6 more, very high quality!
