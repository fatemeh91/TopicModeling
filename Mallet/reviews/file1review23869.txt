review/text: Good deodorant for the money. It does what it should and keeps odors and moisture away all day without issue. Even though it says &#34;clear,&#34; it actually is a white stick. I definitely recommend wearing an undershirt if you use this product.I snagged the six pack Amazon had on sale for $7 - Great deal! I always stock up when I see this on sale.
