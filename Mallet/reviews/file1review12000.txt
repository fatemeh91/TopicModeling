review/text: I have been taking this vitamins for around 6 months. I had been paying over $150/mo before that for other brand that has EXACT SAME INGREDIENTS AS RAINBOW LIGHT, I can't say enough about this vitamins, they make me feel great, have great energy, curve my cravings and the price is ridiculous. My husband and I had been trying to conceive for three years and did a lot of treatments that didn't work. We decided to forget about drugs and started juicing and I cut off dairy products and meats only used sparingly. After about 6 months my period regulated, I felt happy and peaceful and got pregnant. I'm 18 weeks and very healthy. I'm confident this vitamins are part of it and recommend them to all my friends.
