review/text: This is the best potty seat I have seen, and I have tried quite a few. First of all, its adjustable "arms" secure it snug to any toilet so the seat does not move at all! This feature helps give your kids confidence to get up on the potty. Also, it is one piece so you don't have to clean in cracks and crevices. The hook is a great feature, and the seat it lightweight so your child can handle it and "do it myself". Finally, this is a WONDERFUL potty seat for LITTLE BOYS! The angled, built in splash guard is necessary for potty training boys. When it comes to potty training, a daunting task for a little person, you do not want to mess around with inadequate potty seats. Not that one potty seat will work for everyone, but this one is quite near perfect.
