review/text: Got four of these, three for gifts. They work GREAT compared to other similar type sweepers. Amazing how much pet hair they get off carpets. The handle wouldn't stay together, till my son told me I hadn't read the directions. Something about jamming the handle onto the floor before attaching to the sweeper part, and that makes it all stay together. Now, it does. I would recommend this highly. Has a little problem picking up at edges of things, but bought this for two college sons and they love it. Picks up great on throw rugs when company is imminent. This size is a small and is great for storage. We think it's fun to use!
