review/text: Ordered these for my wife, She does a lot of typing at her work. The gloves were delivered quickly and the correct size just as I ordered . She has worn them almost every day at home and Loves them as they help reduce the pain in her hands. She tell me she would recommend these gloves to anyone having the same kind of joint pain from similar work. Great product, Great delivery
