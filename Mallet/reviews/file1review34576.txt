review/text: While researching countless articles about gallstones and how to prevent them, I came across several articles about the benefits of beets and how it helps with not only the pain while passing the stone, but it's preventitve properties. I was also suprised to read that it helps lower blood pressure and gives you energy. Well, I'm here to announce that not only does my side feel better, but my energy level has improved and my blood pressure is way down. Certainly one would expect my BP to be higher while in pain and I took that into account the first time I tried the Beet Root Caps, but it's been a few weeks and I can say that not only is the BP down, but I have to drink less coffee to keep my energy up. I love beets, but I'm not going to open a can everyday and try to rinse off the sodium or, cook the beets when it doesn't go well with the meal, so this is a great alternative. The down side may be the 2 caps 3 times a day, but I don't require that many so it's moot. One more positive is that the energy you feel can best be described as having just experienced a great nap and waking refreshed. I'm a convert and I recommend that for the price you give it a try.
