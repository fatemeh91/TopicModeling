review/text: I've had eczema all of my life and I understand that it won't just go away; it has to be treated consistently. So far this Psorzema Creme seems to be the best I've come across. It actually relieves the itching and keeps it at bay without being harmful like topical steroids. That means that I can use as much of it as I need and as often as I need. As a former topical steroid user, that means A LOT. Plus it never makes it worse before it gets better, which is what I've experienced with other products.
