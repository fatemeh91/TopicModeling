review/text: I have used this ever since I injured my neck in a car accident. It is great b/c it conforms around the neck & also heats the upper shoulders a little bit. I have only used it for heating, and it stays warm enought for at least 20 minutes, which is the recommended heating time from my physical therapist. I would highly recommend this product.
