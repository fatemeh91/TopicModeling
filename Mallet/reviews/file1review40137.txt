review/text: I purchased this kid and it's worked well for me. The bag is junk so I didn't even think of it when I purchased it.The Matt 7/10It's pretty thin, maybe 1/4 of an inch. When doing most of the yoga moves you're fine. I feel it does not provide enough padding if a joint like an ankle is down or if your knees are down for some time. If they are, i fold the mat in 3 pieces to give more cushion. One positive of this mat is that it is sticky. On my hardwood floors, it does not slide or move what so ever. It even makes that nice sticky sound when you pull it up.The negative of the mat is that it lacks cushion. So if you're going to use this for p90x jumping etc, don't. It wont' help very much if at all. Use the other valeo/harbinger mat which is much thicker (so thick i use it for camping trips as a cushion).The Blocks 10/10They are purple, they are foam, they help me balance - what more can I ask. Blocks are rectangular so you can get creative with distance. I actually stack the blocks a lot to give me more to play with.The Bag 5/10I don't really use it at home - i shove stuff in it to look pretty.The Kit 9/10For the price it does the job for me - i would buy it again.
