review/text: Overall, this product does what it's supposed to do. You can't beat the price, and it was delivered fast (I think it took about 4 days total with standard shipping).On the downside, it makes everything you put it in taste like cardboard. I was hoping for no taste, but no luck there. Seriously, no matter what you do and how much you try to cover it up, EVERYTHING is going to taste like cardboard. So, with that in mind, it's best to just put it in a glass of water and drink it down to get it over with, and chase it with another glass to get the taste out of your mouth.Still, despite the taste, it's totally worth it. Another plus is that there's no filler or BS. 4.5g carbs of which 100% is fiber, so no unnecessary calories or carbs.I will definitely buy this again when I run out.
