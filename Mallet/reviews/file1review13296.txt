review/text: These are so wonderful I had a smaller pad but it never seemed to be where it was needed. I bought 3 of these originally and was very pleased. I ended up buying a fourth last week and boy am I glad. I used 3 last night in the past that would've meant I had 3 sets of bed sheets waiting for me in the morning. Obviously it was a bad night but I didn't need to change the sheets until morning.
