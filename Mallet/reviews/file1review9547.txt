review/text: These vitamins are fantastic. These vitamins are a great booster for anyone on the go. As a vegetarian for four years I was always looking for a great supplement to keep my energy up for when nuts and legumes got too pricey. These are a great addition to any diet. I left the vegetarian diet earlier this year and am back to omni status and had switched to a prenatal for a while, but will be glad to get back to these one I finish with breastfeeding.Be prepared to get a pill box or portable container for these, as you will have to take 2 tablets at each meal, but any good food grade vitamin will have similar dosage recommendations. You may not feel different right away, but you will notice the difference when you skip a day and get sleepy around mid afternoon. The extra energy is just what the doctor ordered. Your pee will change color, which is a sign your body is metabolizing some of the nutrients so do not be alarmed. Also, remember to keep drinking lots of water throughout the day and with each dose.
