review/text: It's ok, but way too big for me. My boyfriend bought this for me recently but not from Amazon. It is difficult to go in even slathered in lubricant, kinda hurts, has a strong rubbery smell, and I have the undying phobia that it will somehow "stretch me out", i know it probably won't but it's my paranoia..Overall, tears easy... too big, too pink.
