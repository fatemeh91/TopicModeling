review/text: It's amazing that something this simple can eliminate snoring, but it does. It's a simple mechanical device that sure beats surgery or drugs for simplicity and non-invasiveness. You might need surgery or drugs (or a CPAP machine, etc.) depending on the severity of your problems but you might as well try this first and see if it solves the problem to your satisfaction.I have noticed from time to time that there are positions I can sleep in that leave my head and neck at an odd angle that still results in some back-of-throat snoring type sounds (more like hissing) as I breathe, but it's easy enough to reposition to get rid of that. Still, the major snoring noise is gone, and my wife and I both get better sleep and feel more rested. I didn't realize how much my poor breathing during sleep interfered with the rejuvenation function of sleep. In other words, snoring makes your sleep very erratic. You wake up many times during the night and don't remember it, but you wake up in the morning feeling tired. So it's not just a problem for people who sleep near you; it's probably causing problems for the snorer too.The tan-colored ones are made of some kind of fabric and the adhesive is stronger, which can cause some itching at night and discomfort during removal. I like the clear ones best. Also, the off-brand ones I got at a Long's Drugs store are really bad (too stiff, too sticky, and the adhesive stayed on my face after removal); stick with the name brand.
