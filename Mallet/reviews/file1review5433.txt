review/text: This is a great working product! People keep commenting on the smell, it is a CLEANER not an air freshener! If you have a caked up grime, you have to clean better, more frequently, anyway. It is not the cleaners fault that you are a disgusting person. This product will take off a moderate amount of mildew and will bleach a pink-yellow-white shower curtain to white again simply by spraying on and rinsing off. Ventilation is needed for ANY good cleaners. This product performs wonderful if the directions are followed. My mother used it at my house when they came to visit and wants me to get some for her now but I am not able to find any retailers for it now. Two thumbs up for the product that does wonders! Two thumbs down to all the people that like perfumed cleaners that don't even clean well.
