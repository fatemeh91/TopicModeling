review/text: i have tried many brands and types of bottle brush and now i finally found the one.this brush is just enough soft and flexible to clean bottles well. The bristles are soft and yet sturdy to withstand pressure. Unlike rubber/silicone based brush whose bristles have no strength to stand straight, this will easily clean corner without having to jam the brush into the corner.Another good feature is the lenght, it is around a foot long, so you can use it to clean your vacuum flask/thermos easily as well.
