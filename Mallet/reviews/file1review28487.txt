review/text: I was surprised at how poorly this product dissolved, given the glowing reviews. Without using a blender, after shaking/mixing for five minutes there are chunks the size of dimes. Even after thoroughly mixing with a blender, there are many chunks that are nearly the size of BB's. Adjusting the concentration did not have any effect.The product doesn't taste bad for being what it is. However, having large chunks in any drink is not exactly a desirable texture. I have no problem chugging something that doesn't taste wonderful, but lumps make it much more difficult.I can't attest to the results of the product as I have only been using it a few days. So I give it three stars because I must account for the possibility of amazing results. Ha.
