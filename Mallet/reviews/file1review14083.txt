review/text: I purchased this organizer since it was the same one my sister used and I didn't know of any others. I liked how it looked in the picture, sitting up straight against the changing table holding all the diaper changing needs. However, that picture is very misleading. This organizer sags and leans forward to the point that if you even put half a package of diapers in it the diapers start falling out, if you push down too hard while closing the wipes container the velcro gives out and it falls to the floor...if its that easy to make it come loose I imagine that it will fall the first time my daughter pulls on it. I eventually tied mine with ribbon to help hold it up but it still sags so bad that I'm now shopping for something more sturdy. This was a total waste of money.
