review/text: Miracle Greens (aka Macro Greens) is as good as it claims to be. While taking it and exercising (walking) regularly, I lowered my cholesterol and lost the weight I needed to lose. I will continue to use it because it's probably the only way I'm going to get any vegetables into my body. I didn't give it 5 stars because of the taste. I HAVE to mix it with juice (I prefer sweet tastes).
