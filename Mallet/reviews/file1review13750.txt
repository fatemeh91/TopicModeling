review/text: I bought this to ease pain after laproscopic abdominal surgery. The worst part about that kind of surgery is the air they pump into your abdomen collects at the top of your abdomen and causes sever pain, especially in the front of the shoulders. It was the fact that this product covers the front of the shoulders that drew me to it. It is kind of annoying that you have to move the filling around to distribute it right but it's not that big of a deal; and for me this actually turned out to be a good thing because I could distribute most of it to the top where I needed it. Overall, this was a good purchase.
