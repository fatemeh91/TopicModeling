review/text: We have used the Thermophore pads previously, when I was a Battle Creek distributor in NYC. We sold many of the pads in the three sizes, and almost never had returns. The pads last for many years, and can provide a high level of heat, which can be regulated by a switch on the cord. I would recommend the Thermophore to anyone who needs a sturdy, dependable heating pad, that also provides moisture.
