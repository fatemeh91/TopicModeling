review/text: I like this product a lot.the price is right, youre not paying extra just for the name on it *cough* *cough* *muscletech* *cough*its filtered many times so its almost pure protein. 24g per serving which is really good considering everything else is so low, i.e. fat.i got double chocolate and i think it taste pretty good, especially with milk.i havent notice any digestion problems, and no upset stomach.overall i think this is one of the best products for the price you can get, i definitely recommend this, im buying my second bag as i type this review.
