review/text: I purchased these at my local health food store after unsuccessfully trying to cure a yeast infection for two weeks. I tried everything and none of it worked. I'm on day two of taking this supplement and I feel so much better! I'm also taking acidophilus but I was taking that regularly before so I don't think that matters much. If I deal with a yeast infection again this will be what I try first. Thank you Solaray!
