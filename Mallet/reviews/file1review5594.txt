review/text: The proxabrushes provide the same benefit as flossing. However, they allow you to clean areas betwwen teeth that you might miss with floss due to large/small spaces between teeth. The GUM brand has been ideal for me in maintaining the health of my gums. I recommend them to anyone who needs proxabrush refills.
