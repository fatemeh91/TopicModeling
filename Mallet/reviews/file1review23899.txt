review/text: This is the most dependable non-Rx flu remedy on the market. I've been using it for years. I really feel that it lessens the flu symptoms. With so many immigrants and so many different strains of flu coming in, and with doctors reluctant to give you antibiotics until you have full blown bronchitis or pneumonia, you have to be proactive and take action at the first sign of the flu. I use many Boiron products for a variety of other symptoms - always useful, always natural
