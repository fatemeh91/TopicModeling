review/text: Ordered this ear and nose trimmer to replace my panasonic trimmer. Looks like my old panasonic trimmer. Though the speed seems the same as my old trimmer it just doesnt do the same job. For some reason it takes so much longer to get results. I ended up buying a micro touch max made in china at walmart , It works better than any trimmer I ever had and is more versitile.
