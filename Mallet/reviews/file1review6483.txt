review/text: A friend of mine, who is a message therapist, suggested this item to me. I'm an active person (workouts, kayaking, orienteering, camping, working on the house, etc) and as such, I am constantly getting tight muscles and trigger points. The "rolling around on a tennnis ball on the floor" method was not getting the job done. The Body Back Buddy works beautifully for your back, neck, glutes, hamstrings, anywhere that you need to loosen up muscles and work trigger points to get rid of the pain and/or discomfort.
