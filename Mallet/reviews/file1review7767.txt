review/text: I felt compelled to write a review of this miraculous brush...The lady of the house cooks and as such I am delegated to do the dishes, which is probably for the best as I do them right. You know how it is when someone does the dishes, but they dont do them "right". As an avid and professional household dish doer, I appreciate the devices that make my life easier and this is the best thing ever. The brush is extremely comfortable for the many hours a week it spends in my hand. It is extremely effective at removing everything from stuck eggs, scorched sauce, and all kinds of animal fats stuck to a myriad of kitchen cookware.I absolutely love this brush because it is safe for nonstick and is super durable. I have punished it on many occasions and it still looks brand new. Whenever I feel like rewarding it for its valiant service, it gets a free ride in the dishwasher and comes out as happy and fresh as the day it was born.Seriously though, this is one of if not the best dish brush I have ever had the pleasure of using. It is strong, comfortable, and effective and looks good while doing it.If you are on the fence about it, I say jump and buy it. It is $8.70 at the time of this review and that is a steal compared to what it will do for you, especially if you are the household dish master.
