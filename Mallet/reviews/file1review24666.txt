review/text: I just started this today after reading so many reviews, I was very very hesitant, but I think I'm a lucky one with not too bad of an experience. I'm 5'2" and 115 lbs just looking to lose a few, nothing serious, and was worried of how I'd react to this because I have anxiety, but it was fine. I took one pill with a lot of water, and ate a big bowl of cereal. My appetite the rest of the day was 100% gone. I felt a little high tbh, sort of floaty and a little dissociated but nothing to complain about. I did not have any sort of energy boost, I actually felt more tired if anything. I took another one before dinner and I think that may have been too much for me. I felt fine until just now when I got nauseated very suddenly and strongly, and I threw up phlegm and stomach acid but barely any. That may or may not have also been induced by my taking Tylenol (for the slight headache I had from the pill) on an empty stomach. But definitely start with only 1 pill to prevent a TERRIBLE reaction. See how much your body can handle before jumping on board with 2 pills, no matter how big/ small you are, always ease into it. But yeah, no complaints much yet, and I'll be trying only 1 pill tomorrow. If nothing else, I'll be taking this pill for the appetite suppressant factor (if my symptoms do not persist that is). This pill is definitely not for everyone tho, as many of the negative reviews say. I honestly wouldn't really recommend it as the risk of a bad reaction seems very high.
