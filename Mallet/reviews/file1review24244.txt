review/text: I bought these as a last resort before seeing a podiatrist. Though not diagnosed by a Medical Doctor, I am sure I have plantar facitis. I am a nurse and am on my feet for at least 12 hours daily when working. Just before they arrived, I had so much foot pain that I considered calling in to work until I could see a doctor with the problem. The first day that I put them in my shoes I NEVER took them out. It was uncomfortable for about 2 days, but not as bad as before using the inserts. Within 3-4 days my foot pain was gone. I now wear them all the time. I use the mid-level arch insert which comes with them. The only problem I have with them is that there are only certain shoes I can wear with the orthotics-and so far no sandals and I must wear them all the time or the pain returns. But, the pain relief I have recieved has been worth it. They may not work for some, but they are worth trying if you have severe foot pain as I did. They saved me a few hundred in medical/ doctor fees. I am very happy with the product and will eventually order more. I have had them for 2 years now and they have held up well.
