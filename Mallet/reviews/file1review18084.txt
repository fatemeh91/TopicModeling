review/text: I like this mask. It's comfortable and does a good job of keeping the light out. The only thing I don't like it is Velcro strap. There is a little bump where the two pieces connect, so it can be a problem is you're sleeping on your back. And like all Velcro, it picks up little things and can be tough to keep clean. Not anything dangerous, but just little pieces of dirt or a loose thread off the bed.Overall, a great product though. Helpful for getting into a deep sleep.
