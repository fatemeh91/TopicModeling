review/text: With five dollar shipping this would not be worth it--but as for the product itself, i find it kinda fun if you find it for only a few cents.There are 4 red card and 4 yellow cards. Every red is the same and every yellow is the same--so there are only 2 variations.The red card has choices like--What: Shower Together/Champagne in bed & Where: hotel & When: your birthday.The yellow card has dates and has choices like--What: dinner date & Where: your choice & When: next week.That's the set up for every card (red and yellow each have 3 choices but i wont list them all.) You'll end up repeating eventually but it can be a fun, silly little gift if it were only a few pennies.
