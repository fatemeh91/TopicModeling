review/text: Got blood on my nice super-white shirt collar. Hey, it happens when you're a professional hitman! Kidding! I cut myself shaving. Anyhow hours later I notice I got a blood stain on my collar! I was livid. I like this shirt! It fits me well! It's not one of those shirts made for fatties that have all this extra material everywhere. This one fits me like it was made for me. Which is why I was so mad I got blood on it! There's a CVS nearby, and I got one of these things not expecting much. It works. That's all you need to say. Open it up, rub a bunch of the liquid on with that felt-marker-like tip and it literally disappeared within 2 minutes. Love this product. You should too!!!
