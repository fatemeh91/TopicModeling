review/text: First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else. But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims. I ordered Pumpkin Pie, and I was instantly impressed. Some flavored lip balms don't taste exactly like their flavor, or taste &#34;processed&#34; or &#34;fake.&#34; My Lip Stuff taste EXACTLY like it's flavor. I'm very impressed.My shipment came on time. The receipt had a little &#34;thank you&#34; and smiley face on it (which was very cute). The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it (great presentation). The balm goes on super smoothly and doesn't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex, but I'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too! I will be ordering another one when this runs out.
