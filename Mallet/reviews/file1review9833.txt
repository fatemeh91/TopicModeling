review/text: Tweezerman is a great company that I totally love and trust!These are SHARP! VERY SHARP! They definitely do the trick, I promise you! Along with proper exfoliating before shaving, I've had to use these tweezers less and less but they work well for those ingrown hairs you just can't get rid of!And remember, tweezerman sharpens your tools for free (all you have to pay for is shipping).
