review/text: After contracting ringworm, I tried every over-the-counter remedy I could find. Iodine did almost nothing, tea tree and coconut oil worked, slowly, for a few weeks but the damn fungal patch grew back after partially fading away, and oregano oil was about as effective as tea tree but burned like the dickens and made me smell like a human spice rack. Then I learned about Gentian Violet, a now-nearly forgotten antifungal and antiseptic. Knocked my ringworm out quickly and painlessly. That said, it is messy! It will dye skin purple for a few days, and forget about wearing garments that get touched with the stuff. It'll stain countertops and walls too, if you're not careful. Still highly recommended for fungal infections.
