review/text: One of Amazon's suppliers is selling this for fifty three bucks, an excellent deal compared to what I can find locally. I love this supplement. It's not for weight loss, but getting a full spectrum of vitamins and trace minerals seems to reduce my food cravings (wanting a sugary snack in the afternoon, for example). Also boosts my mood. This and a multi-vitamin are the only supplements I take.
