review/text: I've bought several of these for use at home and at various work kitchens. It is such a useful little guy to have around when you just need to quickly scrub a plate or fork and don't want to get your hands wet/dirty.Obviously, it's not great for bottles or deep glasses where you would need a bottle brush. I tend to use more dish soap when using this than if I used a sponge.I highly recommend this for every kitchen, especially work kitchens.
