review/text: Because I spend hours at the home computer for my job, my neck and trapezius muscles are often sore by the end of the day. This product does provide some welcome relief: the warm moisture makes my shoulders relax and I feel that wonder "aahh" feeling.Since buying the product, I have been warming up the Cozy as a matter of course when I begin my day at the computer, and have noticed a difference in that I have less soreness in the neck and trapezius muscles.The reason I gave 4/5 stars is simply because the Cozy does not stay warm for as long as I would like: in less than an hour, it has cooled down significantly, and because the instructions warn not to re-warm until it is completely cooled (about an hour and a half) I must go without that nice warm feeling for about 45 minutes before I can reheat it.Otherwise, the product works as advertised, and unlike massagers for this area, there certainly is no uncomfortable vibrating or annoying noise to contend with.Lastly, I am not a fan of aromatherapy, but I have found the little lavender insert to be a pleasant plus for the product.
