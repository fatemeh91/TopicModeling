review/text: I been using dymatize nutrition products for a little bit over a year now, I have tryed every single flavor and I will say that the smooth banana tastes really good with milk but horrible with water....If you want to mixed with water get the chocolate one...in terms of results you get a fair amount of protein without fat and sugars which is what I am looking for...also GREAT TASTE!...if you are a hardcore bodybuilder I will not recommend it but if you live a healthy lifestyle and you want to build some extra muscles I will definetly give it a try!Greatings from Chile!
