review/text: I hate condoms. They never fit and I feel like I could slam my wang in a car door and not feel anything. I can say that the Crown Skinless condom is the #1 selling condom on various condom websites for a reason. The superthin condom has fantastic heat transfer and almost feels like wearing nothing.Note that men with above average girth may find them difficult to put on, but they are remarkably stretchy and feel like nothing once they are on.The condoms also came well packaged and shipping was super fast. Great seller.
