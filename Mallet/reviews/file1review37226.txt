review/text: While I do think over time this will help the pain and swelling in my hands especially at night, I have not seen any marked improvement in the way my hands feel when I get up in the morning. They are still stiff, have fuid retension and hurt from a night of inactivity. I will be able to rate them better after the summer humidity hits.
