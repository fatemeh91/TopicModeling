review/text: I really like the butter pecan flavor of Ensure from Amazon. The other flavors are alright, but the butter pecan was the flavor both my husband and I really liked. It is a quick form of refreshment when we are on the go and holds us over to the next meal. Plus you get the vitamins and ,minerals too. The convience of haveing Amazon deliver Ensure to the door is a added plus.
