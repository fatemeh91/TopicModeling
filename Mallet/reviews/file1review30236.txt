review/text: The machine doesn't hold up well with usage. I've had it for a few months and now it overheats after five minutes and turns itself off- even when the canister has been cleaned out. The attachments worked great the first two months and then one by one stopped working. The vacuum power is so weak with the attachments on that I can barely feel it with my hand.Without the attachments, the vacuum is still pretty powerful, but again it overheats after five minutes. I can't even clean small surfaces without waiting for the machine to cool off and turn itself back on.My cat's hair is pretty rough and tends to get itself entwined in fabrics making it really hard to clean up. The spinning carpet attachment did a pretty decent job getting the cat hair off my couch- until it stopped working.
