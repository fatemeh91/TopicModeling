review/text: If design were everything, this beautiful Cross pen would be a prizewinner. From its streamlined clip which sinks into the barrel when not in use, to the huge gold nib, this pen is a looker. That being said, the metal barrel is a bit tinny, and overall the pen is bit lighter in the hand than I prefer. Worst of all is the horrible quality of writing. It skips and consistently needs a downstroke to start ink flowing when writing. I'm quite disappointed in Cross for this pen. It has joined my Sheaffer Intrigue in the pile needing nib attention right out of the box. This pen is too expensive for such poor quality control.
