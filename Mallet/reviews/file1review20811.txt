review/text: The shavor cuts close once it finally picks up the hairs, but the hair just below the jaw line evaded capture for what seemed like ten minutes. By the time I'd finally gotten each one I had razor burn far worse than I would with my regular razor.If it hadn't been so expensive I wouldn't be so dissapointed. It's really not worth the $150 it's going for.
