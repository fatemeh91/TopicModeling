review/text: I turned 40 last year and went from having perfect vision to experiencing eye strain and less than perfect vision. I was prescribed reading glasses, but found that my eyes were still tired. A friend who has similar problems started taking Bilberry supplements and experienced positive results so she suggested I do the same. After taking these supplements for several weeks, I have found that my eyes are less tired and my vision seems to have improved a little (clearer). I will have to see the results over a longer period of time, say over several months but I am pleased with the results so far.
