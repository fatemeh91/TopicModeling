review/text: This brush makes cleaning glasses and bottles a breeze! The bristles are nice and soft and they do a great job of creating suds, which makes me feel like I'm doing a better job cleaning. This brush gets my glasses and mugs clean and the long and slightly flexible handle ensures that I'm never killing my knuckles in the process.I doubt this will last for more than a few months, but at such a good price I'm okay with that. The bristles have started to show wear (some have matted) after a few weeks of use, but I think I can blame my boyfriend for this - he keeps trying to use it to scrub dishes and pans! The bristles are way too soft to be a "heavy duty" scrubbing brush. They are perfect for delicate glasswear though!My only wishes are: it could be more attractive (like some other oxo products), and it would be nice if it had a stand of some sort. It usually ends up drying on my dish rack when I'm finished with it. But for the price, who can complain?
