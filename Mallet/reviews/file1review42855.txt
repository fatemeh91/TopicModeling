review/text: I have been using primal defense for at least 7yrs. I started out giving it to my dog with severe skin issues. I also give it to my cat with IBS and it has made a huge difference with both of my pets. I take it myself and recently my husband has started taking it for a bought of bad tummy troubles after being on some nasty antibiotics. We tried pearls IC for him and they did nothing but he is sold on the primal defense. My husband does not like to take any pills of any kind but he is now recommending primal defense. I also love that these do not need to be refrigerated. I know these are expensive but I think when it comes to probiotics that you get what you pay for. The cost has actually come down some over the years.
