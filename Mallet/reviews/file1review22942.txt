review/text: The Bissell Sturdy Sweep is light weight and quiet. It picks crumbs, dirt, pet bedding, and other debris up from carpet rather well. It also collects dust and lint.It is a great tool for cleaning a moderately sized apartment when a full sized vaccuum would be overkill while a mini vac would be too little.I would definitely recommend this product for quick carpet cleaning.
