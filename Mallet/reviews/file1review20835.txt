review/text: I've shaved with cheaper Braun electric models for years, and when my previous one died, I decided to shell out the extra money to try their nicer model. After all, I shave every day, so an extra $100 to improve that experience for the next 5 years or so should be worth it, right? My answer is, probably yes, for most of us.There are a lot of raves in the reviews here that might lead one to believe this shaver can give you a perfect shave while doing your taxes and improving your love life. I've found it's not *quite* that good. The area in the hollow of my neck that I could never shave with the cheaper Braun electrics still can't be shaved with the expensive Braun electric; I still need to break out a blade to finish up. Nevertheless, a couple weeks' use of the 8585 razor has convinced me that the extra cost over less expensive Braun electric shavers is worth it to me. The foil irritates my skin less than my previous razors did. I seem to be able to shave in a few fewer swipes than I did before. The charging/cleaning stand removes the effort from those two little tasks, at the cost of needing cleaning fluid refills every so often. The stand also eats up a fair amount of space and an electric outlet in the bathroom. It is possible, though, to ignore the stand and use the razor just like you would use a normal model. The shaver comes with a nifty plastic travel case which I found a nice touch - it keeps my shaver from dropping whiskers all over everything in my travel bag.
