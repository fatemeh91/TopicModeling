review/text: I have tried many types and brands of whey protein supplements. Optimum Nutrition is definitely the best I have found. It's all I buy anymore. I use the vanilla mainly for making smoothies or when mixing fruit or other flavors with the whey since it has a more "neutral" taste. Strawberry is the best tasting ON Whey flavor to just drink straight with water or milk. They have a great taste and mix up easier than any protein powder I have tried.
