review/text: Have been using the Cruzer for about a month, and couldn't be happier with it. I've been making do for years with a beard trimmer, and using a razor for close shaving. But, with this device, it's all at your fingertips in one device, and so far I haven't a single complaint. Hard to understand those here who have berated this shaver -- works for me exactly as advertised. I get a close shave AND convenient, consistent, no-hassle beard trimming. It's great. Easy clean-up. Holds a charge for a decent length of time. Overall, a clever and efficient device that does the job amazingly well.
