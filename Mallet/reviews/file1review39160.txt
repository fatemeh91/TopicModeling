review/text: Just do it !Oh - you want more.I (or rather, the GF) have tried a few cheapies in the past - never really had enough power. Bought an expensive Braun recently - clogged up every stroke. Just bought the ChromoPro (from MediaMarkt in Switzerland where we now live) - sliced through hair like a hot knife through butter. So much power it never slowed down. Lots of accessories including the left and right ear tapers. Best #3 cut I ever had. Forget the rest - just buy this.
