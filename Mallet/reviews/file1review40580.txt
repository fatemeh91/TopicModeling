review/text: We have soft water in our area and the dishwasher kept overflowing with suds from the Earth Friendly dishwasher gel, cut way back on the amount we put in and it still overflowed.I read about the different ways to cut back on suds, from using vinegar to cooking oil, but thought it was ridicules to have do this every time I wash dishes in the dishwasher.We have since switched over to Ecover dishwasher tablets and problem solved, and the dishes come out sparkling, clean & spotless.
