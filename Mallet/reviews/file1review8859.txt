review/text: Want health?!!? The price that you can get this stuff for through Amazon.com is unreal. I paid $56 and some change with shipping for a 2 month supply. This is the cream of the crop when it comes to nutrition. At Whole Foods you spend close to $100 with tax.Don't wait another day! GET IT! YEAH BABY!!Chaddy Chad ;-)
