review/text: Bought this as a kitchen sink brush. At times I need more power than the standard size kitchen brush. A stiff bristle and comfortable handle make quick work of rinsing out large pots, pans or plates. Fits all my glassware. I gave it a four stars because it is difficult to work much enthusiasm for a cleaning instrument.
