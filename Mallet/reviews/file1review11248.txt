review/text: This is the best shaver I've ever owned. I have owned many different brands and this one beats them all, hands down. The cutter block lasts a long time, unlike high priced brands. This shaver will not chafe your face like others. I have a very coarse beard and soft skin and this shaver works wonderfully. It shaves very close, closer than any other electric shaver without irritation. It's waterproof so you can rinse it each time you shave, in about 5 seconds, so it stays clean and doesn't get clogged up. If you don't clean it every time you shave it tells you on the display when it's time to clean it. I highly recommend this shaver to anyone.
