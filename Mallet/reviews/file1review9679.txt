review/text: These LOOK great on my husband, BUT they are made from cheap plastic. Really, they feel like children's cheapo sunglasses. The hinges don't open all the way, and in one month, the coating was flaking off. I went for it, reading the previous raving reviews. I really wanted them to work, because from a distance they look great. BUT, they are cheapo and my husband says they are like looking through a fishbowl. "Lenses" are cloudy and plastic. One star for quality. 4 stars for style. 2 stars total.
