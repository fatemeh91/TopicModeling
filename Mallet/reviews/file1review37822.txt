review/text: Decided to try this stuff out because my gf thought it would help increase our fun. I don't even know what this stuff is supposed to do really. I heard stories about it burning folks to giving a good sensation. We didn't experience any of that. Matter of fact I don't even know what it did really. This stuff is slippery and it smells kind of strange. Smells like olives or some kind of plant not to mention the color of the bottle we received was green and not blue like in the picture. I mean the gel/liquid stuff inside the bottle was greenish clear. As lube I guess it's fine if you need it but we brought it for the supposed effects it offers. Only effect I found was the money deducted from my account for the purchase of this stuff. It stinks literally and it doesn't provide any sensation, and the bottle looks like some kind of weird sex toy.
