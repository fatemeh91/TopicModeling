review/text: We purchased the Babybjorn potty chair and loved it when we introduced the potty training process to our then 16 month old son. When he began to prefer to be placed on the toilet we decided to purchase the BabyBjorn training seat and matching stool. I like how the training seat clicks into place on the seat and doesn't move unless pulled up. The attachment mechanism also does NOT break when my son pulls the handle in the back. It is a little irritating that the seat can be so easily removed though and the toilet seat cover cannot be closed because of the handle in the back. The other thing I don't like about it is the urine splash guard. It makes it a little difficult for him to climb on and off the toilet b/c he is so short. While I can see the splash guard as being helpful, it would be nice to be able to remove it so 1) little boys can learn to stand and pee when they are ready and not when they are of a certain height, 2) when the child has mastered the skill (like our now 21 month old) of pointing his penis toward the toilet bowl and it is no longer of use. The splash guard just gets in the way in my opinion. I also think handles would have made this product more useful for my son to be able to climb on and off of. If your child is short (or son is 34") and ready to transition to the toilet I wouldn't recommend this product, it just makes it too difficult for them to be able to be independent on the toilet seat. It might work well with a very tall stepping stool (we are currently looking into this option since the BabyBjorn stool is also too short and of no use at this time).
