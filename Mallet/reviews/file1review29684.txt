review/text: I'm one of those heavy leakers and thought there was nothing out there that would be reusable. These work well and are very comfortable. The lace on the one side keeps the pad in place. A little trick that may help you leak a little less is to flip your nipple up against the pad. In other words, put a kink in the fire hose line. (Not everyone's anatomy is apt for this, but it works for me.) After nursing two of my boys, these have been the best to not show through clothing. For those complaining about them showing through--Nursing pads work best with nursing bra's; I just find the normal bra's are to thin to cover up any pad.My favorite nursing bra for support and now showing through clothing:[...]If your looking for convenience then I suggest disposable, otherwise you're going to have to carry a ziplock baggie with you everywhere for the pads. They need changing as often as you would a disposable. Just like any other pad.
