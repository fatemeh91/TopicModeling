review/text: Having used fish oil as a dietary supplement for over 15 years, the thought of something better was hard to visualize. That is until I was told that my cholesterol was 241. I said, "How can that be? I take Omega3 fish oil?" "Well, maybe you aren't taking enough." was the reply from my cardiologist as she wrote out a prescription for the 'prescription strength' fish oil supplement. After six months, nothing had changed. Then, I read an article on Krill oil and how it is the source for the Omega3 fatty acids (FA) you get from fish. The Krill are basically a plankton type crustacean that fish eat. The concentration of Omega3 FA actually gets diluted in the fish due to body mass. The article also showed that while fish oil will decrease cholesterol on average of 4-6%, the Krill oil will reduce cholesterol 38-42%. Just so you know I am not making this up: (Bunea R, El Farrah K, Deutsch L.Evaluation of the effects of Neptune Krill Oil on the clinical course of hyperlipidemia. Altern Med Rev. (2004) 9.4: 420-428). So, I started taking Krill oil instead of fish oil. The results were that in 6 months my cholesterol dropped to 142. I did not change anything else (exercise, diet) in my daily routine. Now, my cardiologist is telling her patients about the advantage of Krill oil. Oh, why TwinLabs? TwinLabs has always held to the standard of laboratories that manufacture prescription medications so their products have consistency in effectiveness, quality and potency. Even with the acquisition by ISI, they still produce dependable quality that is rarely seen in the supplement industry. If I am going to trust my heart health to a supplement such as Cardio Krill, I am going to make sure it is the best.
