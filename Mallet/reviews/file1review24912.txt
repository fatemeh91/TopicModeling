review/text: Me and my husband had been ttc for about 4 yrs, we were basically giving up and i saw this product on line. We decided to try it. All i can say is we took it for about 2 weeks and i ended up pregnant! I don't know if it was the product for sure, but we will definately buy it again if we decide to have another baby.
