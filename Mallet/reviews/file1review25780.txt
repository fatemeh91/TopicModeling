review/text: I had a Panasonic ear/nose trimmer for about 15 years when it finally quit. I replaced it with one from The Sharper Image and had to return it because it pulled the hair instead of cutting it and was very painful. I was leery of getting this Panasonic one because of other reviews saying that this was doing the same thing (pulling the hair). Well I've used it now for a couple of months and it's the best one I have ever had; smooth, quick, quiet, and most important "No Hurtful Pulling of Hairs"!!! I'm buying another for a spare.
