review/text: Research has mixed results regarding the use of this, but I did notice an improvement in memory after 2-3 weeks of use, but maybe it doesn't work for everyone.As a side note, on the bottle it suggests that some might want to use along with two other supplements, DMAE and Ginko Biloba. I didn't know this until I received the product, next time I order, I will try it along with those two and update this review.
