review/text: I've been thru many others and this mask is the one! This may sound weird but if you have unusually long eyelashes as I don it makes whereing a normal sleeping mask very uncomfortable. The foam backing this mask uses lifts the mask away from my eyelashes while maintaning a tight, "lite-proof" seal, again thanks to the foam. Count on replacing every 2 years as the plastic will start to crack or tear around the edges...worth every penny!!
