review/text: This is the first time I've ordered this particular product online. We've gotten it in the past through a friend who bought it from an ND. Anyway, the product in itself is fine; however my experience with the seller was not.I decided to delete my initial feedback (due to the fact that my order FINALLY arrived a MONTH after the fact). Since you cannot re-enter your seller feedback, I thought I'd mention it in my post.I placed my initial order on Sept. 4th; the package was supposedly shipped (USPS) Sept. 8th. I was supposed to have received it by the 16th, however it NEVER came. I sent 2 emails to the company on the 22nd & 26th- with NO response. I then decided to submit an A-Z claim through Amazon on the 29th, to which I was reimbursed accordingly. Then TODAY I finally received my package in the mail. The outside of the box showed that it had been shipped a few days ago. Anyway, I notified Amazon this afternoon so that they can re-bill my account.In conclusion, I decided to give the seller 2 stars instead of 1; but in the future I will most likely look elsewhere to buy my D-3.** The ingredients for this formula has not been included on this page. If you were wondering, go to: OrganicPharmacy .org Under "Manufacturer", look for "Dynamic Nutritional Associates - DNA Labs" , then under "product sort" choose "O" and click on "Oedemadin (D-3)". **
