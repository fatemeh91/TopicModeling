review/text: This product gave me an allergy, I felt like I was going to die or something, I get nightmares just thinking about it. It seems that 0.5% of the population is susceptible to soy allergies and I happen to be one of them. Anyway, this product is not completely whey like the company claims, in fact it has cheap soy added to it. If you will look at the allergen information, it says that soy lecithin is been added to improve mixability. I feel like I have been cheated, if I was living in the United States then I would have sued optimum for sure.People get your facts straight, whey is imported into United States from Newzealand and Australia. If you check any Newzealand or Australian sites you will know that Whey isolate is very very expensive. It is impossible to sell 10 pounds of this stuff at $60(even if it was a mix of whey concentrate-a cheaper version of whey) If some of you consider suing Optimum, please remember me and send me check as well :-) Right now I don't take anything manufactured by so called "bodybuilding product" companies. Remember in 2005 another company Ultimate Nutrition was sued for Super Complete capsules by some Swimmer and had an out of court settlement for half a million dollars.
