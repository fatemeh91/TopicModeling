review/text: The old waterpik finally bit the dust. Was going to try to repair it, but after 10 years, I figured it was time for a nice, shiny new one. First thing I noticed was how much more powerful his unit was compared to the old one....I guess the old one had just worn down. In any case, this new one does everything the old one did but better. I hope it works as long as the old one and a lot longer than the 2 year warranty...we shall see.
