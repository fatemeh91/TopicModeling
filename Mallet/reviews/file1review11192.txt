review/text: The main reason this thermometer got 1 star was because it lasted about 20 uses in less than a month and now the thing beeps real long at me when I try to use it. The battery is dying already!Also, the backlight doesn't last long enough for me to actually see the measurement taken.The recall information was not there 50% of the time when I turned it back on.It takes temperatures quick, but that's about it. Please don't waste your money on this.
