review/text: I think that it should be understood that the vitamins that you take once a day must be chemical, not whole food in nature. How can you expect to get real food nutrition out of a tiny pill of compressed fake chemical stuff? I gladly make the time to take 2 with each meal, not a big deal really, because they work! I feel so much better when I take them than when I don't. I am a 51 year old with pre-menopausal symptoms and the little things, like night achiness, that I thought were just something I was going to have to live with as I grew older, are gone when I take this regularly. Night sweats were much diminished and with the addition of pycnogenol to my vitamin regimen, they are now gone, completely. Hallelujah. I have energy and stamina that I did not have before. No digestive issues either. For $15 a month? For 6 pills a day? It is priceless to feel so good, and it is not an expensive medication that could potentially harm me. I recently tried a different highly recommended brand of supplement that only required me to take 3 a day with none of the benefits of Rainbow Light Women's Nutritional System. I gave it a couple of weeks and finally had to switch back because I just was not feeling as good. Now I am a regular customer, no need for me to look around and try other products. I am grateful to have finally found a supplement that addresses my body's nutritional supplement needs. Feels good to feel good! Give this vitamin a try and take the 6 a day. You will know with a short few days if it does your body good or not. Good luck.
