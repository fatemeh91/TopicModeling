review/text: I bought a bar of this soap, and unwrapped it and placed it in the shower. The next morning, I got up and went in the bathroom to shower, and the bar of soap was on the floor on the other side of the room! I was in a hurry so I didn't think to much of it at the time. I just picked up the soap and took a shower. Of course, when I was done, I left the soap in the shower.The next day, I got up to shower again, and the soap was on the floor again, all the way on the other side of the room!After that, I decided to get rid of it. Until I see something in the news that explains how a bar of soap can move by itself, I'll never by this soap again.
