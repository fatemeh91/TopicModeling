review/text: The Body Back Buddy is as described and seems to be well-made. It's a type of plastic, but it's quite stiff and it doesn't flex too much. The only caveat is that it may not fit individuals with a large chest. I have a 47" chest and the larger side just barely fits around my chest. It still works for me, but if your chest is larger than 47", it may be a problem.
