review/text: I started taking fertilaid a month and a half ago after 6 years of ttc after having my other 2 kids previously with no problems and started my period exactly 4 days after starting them making it a 40 day cycle which is very good for me(I am extremely irregular).I did notice an easier period than usual so at this time I was thinking wow,these are great.I did opks every day after with no positives and now I'm on cycle day 45 with no period still.I have taken 3 pregnancy tests just in case and of course all negative so I'm not sure what to think.After a month and a half of taking these I was hoping to at least have starting my period earlier this time and have ovulated.I'm going to wait a little longer and if I still haven't started my period may have to stop taking them and see what happens.
