review/text: I have been in the health field for years and know brands and products. I also have smoked in the past and can tell you that within 30 minuets for me since my digestion is fast it starts to work by clearing excess mucus and swelling in my lungs and lympth nodes. It also has been studied for mentally ill people to help their brains detox. They did a study with 1 gram in morning and 1 gram at night for schizophrenics. I like this method of detox the best nice and clean and fast. As for the tinnitus there isnt anything that will help that I have it too best thing you can do is go with the flow and not fight the inevitable and your stress will go down. Learn to enjoy it. This brand is time release wich is unique. The only other brand I would suggest is solgar vegitarian.hope it helps you it has helped me alot. My mind is clearer too.
