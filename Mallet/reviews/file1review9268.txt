review/text: Works perfect for the amount of supplements I take. I can fit 4 normal size and 1 large supplement in either am/pm side of the daily pocket. Its cute enough to leave on my dresser and super easy to grab one and take to work with you. Product is tough enough to just throw around and not get damaged during travel.
