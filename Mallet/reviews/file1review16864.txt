review/text: I have also had the neck surgery with fusion, and bought this in order to relax the muscles and help get rid of the pain in my neck. I found it to be too noisy and the vibrating really irritated my eyes. It feels that it is under filled and doesn't give much support other than the round hard vibrator inside.
