review/text: I was really looking forward to getting this item as I was dealing with a reoccurring problem with my neck that has plagued me since my early twenties. Unfortunately, this item didn't live up to expectations. I followed the directions for heating the collar in the microwave and secured it around my neck and that's when the problems began.Firstly, I had a difficult time getting it to fit snugly around my neck. I have a 15 3/4" neck and I couldn't get it to fit tight enough and the Velcro wouldn't keep it into place once I had it secured. I had to hold it closed with my hand to keep it from coming apart.Secondly, the collar doesn't get hot enough nor does it retain heat nearly long enough. I usually use a clay heating pad which I place on a rolled up towel and then lay down on the floor. The clay heating pad retains heat for more than fifteen minutes and works excellent. I was looking for something that I could use while sitting and moving around and thought this would be a great product but the heat retention and fitting just isn't there.I'll probably pass this on to my brother as he has a bigger neck and maybe he'll have better luck with it as I can't see ever using this item again.
