review/text: I received this as a gift along with a long vibe as part of a gift pack called the White Nights Collection. I love the velvety exterior. I had this and my other &#34;friend&#34; for about 5 years and they are both going on strong!I have had such a positive experience with Doc Johnson products I think it would be the only brand I would purchase from.I have no need to replace at this point, but once I do, I know where I will be looking.Highly recommended to everyone!
