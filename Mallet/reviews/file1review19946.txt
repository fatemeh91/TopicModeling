review/text: You can ask my husband - I've purchased at LEAST 5 potty seats since getting our son to use the potty. I've returned 4 of them immediately after seeing how the design of the seat would not work for our son (I would have a little Bellagio Fountain spraying on my floor instead of the toilet). The one seat that did end up staying in our house seemed great at first, but I later discovered that there were gaps on the bottle of the seat that captured urine and required constant cleaning. So I sucked it up and threw down the money for the more expensive Baby Bjorn. WHY didn't I buy this sooner!?!?This is the best potty seat I purchased. There are absolutely no hidden gaps or fabrics that can soak up or trap urine. It is adjustable to fit into any type of toilet seat. There is a small splash guard (more like a ridge) in the seat so no "fountaining" can occur. Everything that I've complained about in the previous potty seats is addressed with the Baby Bjorn - it works fantastically! Highly HIGHLY recommended.
