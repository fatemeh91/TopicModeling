review/text: I bought my original portapower about 30 years. I was heartbroken when the motor konked out last year. I went on ebay to see if anyone was selling theirs and found they are still being made as commercial machines. I have had the new one for several months and love it even more than the original. It has tremendous power for a little vac and is pretty easy to carry around. Great for stairs. The only thing I don't like is the thick electrical cord attached to it. It is cumbersome. I would highly recommend this machine. It is worth its weight!
