review/text: I am a college swimmer, so I've seen my fair share of supplements get put through the paces in the weight room, on the field, and in the pool. I've always been told that if I go whey, go Gold Standard. My friends were right. This easily is the best protein supplement I have used.The taste and texture are fantastic, and it apparently digests well--there was no "drunk" effect often experienced by an overload of protein. I toss a scoop with a banana, milk, and a couple ice cubes into my magic bullet after practice and voila! a perfect recovery drink.My only regret was not buying a bigger container!
