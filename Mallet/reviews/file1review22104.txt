review/text: I have tried 4 other brands and these are the worst. I haven't had any problems with leakage (with this or any other brand) but after 3-4 washes the Medela pads are so wrinkled and have lost their shape that I can't wear them with anything without them showing through. I would not recommend these unless you were going to hand wash them - but who has time with a new babe! Especially, when the other brands are holding up just fine after the same number of washes.
