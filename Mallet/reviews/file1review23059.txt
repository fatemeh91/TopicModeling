review/text: I wish people that had problems with the handle would not have given the item so many stars. I admit I neglected to read the reviews ahead of time because I was in a hurry, but also because it's a cheap, simple sweeper with 4 stars. How could I go wrong? I agree that the sweeper part works well, but the handle is junk. Sure, you could tape it, but even at the price you shouldn't settle for something so poorly designed. If only all the parts of the handle screwed in, or locked, it would be fantastic. But they don't. It fell apart on me 3 times in less than five minutes.I'm returning it immediately.
