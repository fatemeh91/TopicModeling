review/text: I was looking for a multi alarm system and the multi clock style alarms were not adequate enough. I stumbled on this pill timer while searching. I am so glad I did. I am using it both as an alarm for other things and I started taking my vitamins because of this pill timer as well.The compartments remove easily for ppl who may have pain in their hands. They are not so easy that they fall off by themselves - which is a plus.The slide buttons to set the alarms are easy to move, I do have to press the button to turn off the alarm a few times but nothing to complain about, in my opinion.It comes with 4 pill compartments and one can buy and add more if needed. The compartments are generous sized. I don't' have an old fashioned half dollar but I would guess they are that size around and are about .65" deep. The clear top that covers the alarm settings is easily opened and snaps shut, but again, not too hard to open.The alarm CUBE is a nice size, it can easily fit into a man's messenger bag or a woman's purse as long as it is not a clutch purse. It fits, laying down, in my desk.The alarm is loud enough for me. I can hear it when it is in another room. If you are hearing impaired, it probably wouldn't be loud enough for you to do that. The alarm is not irritatingly loud or obnoxious.Someone mentioned it was ugly and institutional looking. I would like to see something that isn't, in that person's opinion. What isn't these days? I think the iPods and cell phones are institutional looking so I guess it's a matter of perspective.One thing that may be important to potential users. One can only set alarms on the hour, no half hour alarms.If you have any questions, comment on this review and I will update this review to answer your questions.
