review/text: I bought one of these after the dentist recommended I get an electric toothbrush because flossing wasn't doing the job. This is terrific. You can change the head when the bristles begin wearing out. It's easy to do. My dentist also noticed my gums were firmer from the massaging action of the bristles. Now when I go for a checkup I spend less time in the chair getting the plaque taken off. I still need to floss but it just routine.
