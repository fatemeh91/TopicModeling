review/text: I started using this product in its pure form in 5oz hammer gel re-usable flasks, grimacing the stuff down while quickly chasing it with water. I found cutting the gel with 1:1 ratio of water to gel helped getting past the non-pleasant flavor. The problem with the orange flavor is that it tastes more like thick simple syrup, with very little if any "orange" in it. This tends to overpower your taste buds. The taste aside, the product works wonders. I noticed the difference using the gel made immediately. I was able to ride farther without much muscle pain or energy drain using the gel than what I had experienced with a couple of energy bars eaten while riding. I would skip orange altogether and try something more palatable, like raspberry.
