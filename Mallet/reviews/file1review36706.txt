review/text: I bought this after I read reviews about how wonderful it tastes. Well, it didn't taste that great to me. It didn't taste like berries. I was using Chewable Vitamin C by NOW products and that orange taste was like drinking a glass of Tang.The tablets are HUGE! It was a little hard to just pop in your mouth and chew. I won't be buying this anymore. No one in my family likes it and I am stuck chewing all of this!
