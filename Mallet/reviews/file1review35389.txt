review/text: I'm someone who exercises frequently and takes care of their body, but I'll be the first to admit I have a HORRENDOUS diet. I just seem to love and or crave the taste of foods filled with sugar and fat, and I'm certain I'm not alone. Thank goodness for this product! Now, I can make a tasty chocolate shake in the morning that essentially works as a multivitamin! I just mix a scoop of my spiru-tein, about half a tablespoon of instantized coffee, either half a scoop of platinum hydrowhey or cocoa mix (depending on which one I have at the time), and voila! A super nutritious drink that will keep me full and get my metabolism going for the day! I would note that the spiru-tein powder should be mixed with something else low cal that's chocolate flavored because it's incredibly mild in terms of chocolate taste. Also note that I use a mini blender to mix all these ingredients. This is a necessity, because the spiru-tein isn't easy to mix as it claims. It's not really the taste of the powder that makes it phenomenal, it's the nutritious value and the flexibility it has in mixing with other chocolate powders or whatever you'd prefer to create a drink that actually tastes good for how many vitamins it contains. For the people who have had other chocolate protein powders, keep in mind this does not taste as sweet or as starkly chocolate. The smell is not sweet or chocolately either, to me it was almost fishy smelling, but I don't have a strong sense of smell so this had zero effect on my perception of the drink and the taste. In general, for anyone who would like to improve their health, I'd certainly recommend this product.
