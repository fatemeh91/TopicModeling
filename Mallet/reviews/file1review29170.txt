review/text: I've used this toothbrush for a few months and its amazing. I brushed my teeth with the standard manual toothbrush for 24 years, and after using this brush I wish my parents would have started me out on it. You just can't get the cleaning from regular brushes you get from this brush with the rapidly rotating brush head. Plus, it prevents gum damage and overbrushing, and allows you to use less pressure. The battery is still going strong, and for the $6 or so it is so worth it. I thought I was good brushing manually, but now I feel my teeth are twice as clean.
