review/text: I took this at the first hint of coming down with a head cold that my kids were passing around. I managed to take the recommended dosage for one day, two capsules five times a day. You are supposed to take the capsules for two days but after taking it for one day, I found myself feeling much better. It seemed to work for me. I never came down with the head cold.I think the product is a bit pricey but I might be willing to try it again the next time I feel a cold coming on. The only other complaint I have is that it is a lot of pills to be taking in a two day period.
