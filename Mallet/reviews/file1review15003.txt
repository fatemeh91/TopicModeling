review/text: I have struggled my whole life with soft nails which crack and split as soon as they begin to grow; consequently, I've always looked like a nail-biter though I don't bite my nails. My daughter suggested I try a hair, skin and nails vitamin so I halfheartedly agreed and began taking Futurebiotics Hair, Skin and Nails. In less than a month I was thrilled to notice that my nails were all growing with not a split or crack in sight; in fact, they were quite hard. It's been two months now and I have pretty, strong nails that I can polish and feel proud of, instead of being embarrassed about. My skin seems better, too....when my sister saw me at a family reunion last week she said my skin looks like that of person in her 30's (I'm almost 60). I highly recommend this product and will continue taking it. I don't have any problem with the smell, as do some other reviewers.
