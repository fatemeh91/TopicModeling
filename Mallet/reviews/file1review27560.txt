review/text: I use this to get my protein in for the morning, however, I've read a lot about the use of artificial flavorings (sugar, etc.) in which I don't mind, but for those who do, maybe the Natural powder would do (which only comes in Chocolate and Vanilla). Overall, I enjoy this flavor as well as a few others of theirs'.
