review/text: I purchased these pads for MIL, who is incontinent during the night. I had purchased some from a local store earlier and they were not absorbant nor did they wash well, they still smell bad after washing. These pads are very high quality and absorbant, they launder very nicely and are soft to lie on. We bought the larger size. You will be happy if you purchase these, do so before you try any others and waste your money.
