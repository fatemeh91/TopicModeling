review/text: I thought this was going to be the greatest. But I was disappointed because of the adjustable frame. On the bottom of the frame it's difficult to see in the picture, but their are two thumb screws to adjust the bracket up and down so it lay flat on the bed. If you have a foot board which I do most bed do you need to reach way down between foot board and mattress to get at these screws, and the sheets and blankets are in the way. Very cumbersome this way I take it out and put it back under at night thats how difficult these screws are and caregivers have difficult time need to explain how it works it's hassle. BUT otherwise! It holds the sheets/blankets well and size is good it's made well but this was very disappointing. The white cheaper one which I had was easier to use but not as well made as this one.
