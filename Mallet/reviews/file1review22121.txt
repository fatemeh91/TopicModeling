review/text: I bought this thermometer/pacifier thinking &quot;how easy&quot;. In reality though if your baby has a fever and is crying it is not easy to keep a pacifier in the baby's crying mouth. If your baby is not crying from the fever the pacifier works just fine. In addition to this thermometer you still need the backup of a regular thermometer.
