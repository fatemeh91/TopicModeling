review/text: After throwing out an inconsistent digital scale, I opted to spend a little extra money for a beam scale. However, this purchase has been a complete disappointment. The parts are light weight and cheap. Definately not the sort of quality that one would find in a doctor's office. The beam feels like it is made of aluminum and the fulcrum seems to be plastic. The "slide" is also light weight. The light weight parts tend to stick. This scale definately does not have the smooth operation associated with scales found in a physician's office containing heavier parts.However, the main problem with the scale is its imprecision. Depending on whether the scale is initially set too light or too heavy, my weight can vary by up to 3 or 4 pounds - all without even stepping off the scale. How can I simulateously weigh both 185 lbs and 188.5 lbs? I don't know, perhaps Detecto's quality control department is run by quantum physicists. Regardless, the scale is complete garbage - although it might contain a couple of bucks worth of aluminum if one chose to recycle it.I bought an Escali B180RC 2 weeks ago. Much better scale at a quarter of the price.
