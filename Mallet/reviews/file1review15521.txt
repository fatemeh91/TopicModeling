review/text: I use a portable Discman that takes 2 double A's, and just finished my multpack of Energizers. So based on its reviews I tried these out. However in my discplayer, these last only about 2 weeks before I get a low battery indication. With the Energizers I only had to change them once a month.With other electronics such as remote controls, you may not notice the performance diffrence.
