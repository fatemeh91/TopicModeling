review/text: I have owned Braun, Panasonic, Remington and Philips cordless electric shavers and the Shave Pro works just as good or better then any of them! Besides giving a "straight edge" smooth shave the razor is pretty quiet and doesnt vibrate very much in the hand. It even has a little safety button on the power slider, very cool! Cant comment about long term durability or battery life yet but as electric shavers go its fantastic. The Shave Pro uses a foil which gives a super close shave but doesnt cut if your scruff is more then a "5 oclock shadow". In that case you have to slowly trim down your beard with the supplied trimmer attachment. (you have to do this slowly or you will get some sharp pulls on your skin. This is inherit of all brand trimmers) My skin is semi sensitive but there are no issues for me with this shaver. It shaves as comfortable as the most expensive Braun ive ever owned. (the reviewer that was getting cut may have had a break in the foil)Speaking of foil, my favorite part about this shaver is that it comes with an extra one. Every shaver ive owned in the past would get a break/chip in the foil and the companies charge between $30-$50 for a new foil. I bought a Remington brand foil razor at wally world for $30 and within a year the foil broke. They wanted $26 for a new foil (automatically comes with cutter) so for $4 more I simply bought a new razor. Well less then a year later that foil broke as well. Got tired playing games and thats when i bought this shaver. Having and extra foil is like getting 2 shavers for the price of one and that makes the Shave Pro an even more awesome deal!
