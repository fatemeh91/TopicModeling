review/text: I bought this, not for cleaning up after a pet, but for cleaning up after my toddler! It is great for picking up cheerios, puffs, and other food that gets all over the floor. I wouldn't recommend using this in place of a vacuum, but in addition to one. I just run it over the floor real quick after meals and snacks.The only reason I took off one star is because the handle does continuously fall apart unless glued together. After one day, I knew that was going to drive me nuts, so I used a little gorilla glue and now it's perfect!
