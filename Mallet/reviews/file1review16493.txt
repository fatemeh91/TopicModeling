review/text: I'd found that I wasn't producing enough acid after years of great difficulty in digesting food. I was falling more and more sick despite being in my late twenties. After finding another product in a smaller, cheaper bottle for a test run I was astonished at the terrific results. I was far more energetic and even my skin improved. With this in mind I sought out a larger bottle and went for this. However, despite this product having nearly double both the Betaine and Pepsin, I was finding that in order to reach the same result that I was having to take four times the pills. Which, in this iteration are far larger than the ones I'd taken before. In going over another's review, I found a man that was a scientist that had done a chemical analysis of this product to find it contains a large amount of calcium carbonate as a binder (most likely the 'milk' mentioned in the ingredients). Which, is the primary ingredient in Tums acid reducer tablets. That's right. This product counteracts its own self. Which explains my having had to take so many tablets compared to before. Having found a similar product from Vital Nutrients that also contains Gentian. An effective bitter that could aid in Bile production. Considering that the price paid is only a tiny bit higher, I'm thinking that the fact it doesn't contain any reactive ingredients as this one does that I'll be taking quite a lot fewer of them. Saving money over time.Avoid this one and go for something else NOT containing calcium (milk) and you should be happy.For the review: (http://www.amazon.com/review/RB3P6C2APP138/ref=cm_cr_pr_viewpnt#RB3P6C2APP138)
