review/text: I'm a firm believer that liquid medicines & supplements absorb in the body faster than pills. However this stuff tastes HORRIBLE. I tried some of the tips/tricks other reviewers suggested to make it a little more palatable (mix with seltzer water, dilute with water, add to juice, drink water immediately after taking it etc), I just can't stomach it. Back to pill form for me.
