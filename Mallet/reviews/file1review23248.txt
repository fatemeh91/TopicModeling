review/text: I was highly skeptical about the claims that it picks up pet hair, but it really does, surprisingly well. Worth the price for that alone, as it's so much easier to clean the brushes than it is for a regular size vac.It's quick to grab and use, very lightweight, and takes care of high traffic areas in no time. Does a great job for the amount of effort it takes. It even picks up the hay that gets tracked around from my daughter's guinea pig cage.We're moving, so for easier future transport, we haven't yet pounded in the handle as per the instructions. Because of this, it does occasionally fall apart, though infrequently enough that it isn't a big deal. Very confident that once it's put together firmly, it'll stay together.You'll still need a vaccuum cleaner for corners and possibly for an occasional deep clean. A broom does a better job just as easily on solid floors. But for the money and for the purpose, this product is fantastic.
