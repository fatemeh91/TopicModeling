review/text: I was delighted that this was sugar free for the same price as sugared version. I was getting 12 packs in each box and wondered why the boxes [ i bought 2] was so small on arrival. I have been buying the sugared version for over a year and the boxes were always larger. To my surprise instead of 44 pieces each bag has 22. I give these away free at work and thought about thier teeth. Anyway, they are going to have to worry about their own teeth because I am going back to the sugared type. i have them so much longer that way!
