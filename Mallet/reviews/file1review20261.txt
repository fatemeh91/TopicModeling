review/text: I used these as cloth diapers with my second child for the first two months. They work well, especially with a liner, when the baby is eating and being changed every 2-4 hours. Even on a 6-lb newborn, they're not bulky. When the baby starts to sleep longer than 4 hours, though, a more absorbent diaper becomes necessary. Right now, I'm double-layering mine until my bamboo terry squares are delivered. As a cheap, readily available newborn cloth diaper, these are great. You do have to know how to fold a flat diaper, though. I suspect that may be the issue with the reviewer who said these don't work as well as the prefolds. A flatfold offers more versatility and can be a much better diaper if you know how to use it.The low price of this product, coupled with its several other uses, more than make up for its short life as a diaper. We've used ours as burp cloths, cleaning/dust rags, (very) informal cloth napkins, paper towel substitutes, etc. Don't be dismayed when you first take them out of the package! They seem thin and useless, but a quick run through the laundry fluffs them right up.
