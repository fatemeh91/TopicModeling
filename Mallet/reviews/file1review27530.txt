review/text: I have used both the Chocolate and Banana flavors (sometimes I even mix them for extra goodness) and I can say that they are the best tasting powders I have tried (of 6 or 7 brands). They do taste best when mixed with milk instead of water, though. Lots of taste plus lots of cost-effective protein makes a great protein powder!
