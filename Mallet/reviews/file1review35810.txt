review/text: I bought this on a whim recently at Target. I had always followed my father's shaving ritual of inexpensive razors and shaving cream, combo of Bic single disposable and Barbasol sensitive skin.My wife and daughter bought me a kit from the art of shaving including a brush, shaving soap and and a lighted power handle for the Gillette power fusion. I always felt like the razor dragged across my face wheter I used the shaving soap from the brush, edge, or Barbasol I basically hid from my wife that I was using Bic Razors instead of her gift. After using this product, the razor glides like a ski over my face, no irritation at all, and a very close shave. the only negative is that it requires quite a bit of pressure on the valve, and usually wind of with too much product. At this price, it really doesn't matter.
