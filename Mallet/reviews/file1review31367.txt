review/text: I purchased this product together with another product (Prosacea) as my FINAL attempt to get some relief from my ever-worsening condition. Prior to this, I had tried several other natural products ranging from anti-fungals to various "healing" creams. Nothing had helped at all. I decided to make one final search for something and found this pair of products. Unlike with previous products that I had tried using one-at-a-time so I would know which one was helping (and since none of them did any good), I tried using these two products together. After a week or so I began to notice some drying/flaking of my skin. And, low and behold, after rubbing off the dead skin, the underlying skin was much lighter in color. It's been several weeks nowof twice daily application of the two products, and the condition continues to improve, little by little...Praise God for leading me to these products!
