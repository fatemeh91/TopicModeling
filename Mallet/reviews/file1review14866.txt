review/text: I started taking MET-Rx in the early 90's after taking junk like Hot Stuff etc. I could not believe what happened to me. In just two weeks I saw results. I started gaining strength and size almost immediately. Started at 165 and ended up at 205+. My personal records done while taking two MET-Rx a day were 365 bench, 395 squat and 335 x 3 *stiff leg* dead lift. I still use MET-Rx to this day although I admit I only take one a day now. I also took creatine which made me strong and HMB.
