review/text: I purchased one a few months ago for my left knee because my knee cap nolonger tracks right when I jog. It worked so well that I decided to purchase another one for my right knee because of I.T. band pain after 3.1 miles. I am now able to jog a 5K without fear of my knee going out or pain. The spring steel in the sides actually spring your knees forward when you run which is kinda neat. I totally recommend this product
