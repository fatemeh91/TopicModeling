review/text: The prenatal cradle has helped my back pain significantly, and I am happy with it. It gets 4 stars because it doesn't relieve my back pain completely. In addition, the sizing is hard to get right. Most reviews said even if you rate as a size small according to the prenatal cradle's weight recommendations, to get a size medium. Therefore, that's what I did. I use it on the smallest of the three settings, and it works pretty well. However, I was just beginning my 3rd trimester when I started wearing it. I am quite large (this is my second pregnancy, and at 32 weeks now I've already exceeded the amount of weight I gained during my entire pregnancy the first time around, which ended just before 36 weeks), but I'm also only 5 feet tall. Yet, even now, I am 40 lbs below the minimum suggested weight for the size medium. Had I ordered the cradle sooner, and I needed it sooner because my back started hurting during my second trimester, it might have been too large to use at first even on the smallest setting. Whether or not the prenatal cradle size small would have worked throughout my second and third trimesters, I will never know, but I'm thinking it would have. So my suggestion would be if you are short, to get the size that does match your weight, and if you are an average or tall height, to get one size larger than your weight.I'd also like to mention that I tried a couple of the supporters that go around the hips and lower back. One of them relieved my back pain completely, but it squeezed my hips so much that it hurt my hips to walk, and it folded over and was uncomfortable when I sat down. The other one I tried made my back hurt even more than without wearing it. The prenatal cradle is very comfortable while sitting or standing, and as I mentioned earlier, helps reduce my back pain a ton. I do wear a thin, stretchy, seamless, short-sleeved shirt underneath it. Good luck!
