review/text: I have a very sensitive stomach and cannot take any multi vitamin. I take these in the regular and prenatal. I only take the prenatal to grow my hair and nails. I have used these vitamins for a couple years now and they do not bother my stomach. Well worth the price for me as the Dr says to stay on a multi vitamin. I will purchase them again and again. Cheaper here than anywhere.
