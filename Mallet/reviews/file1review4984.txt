review/text: I had purchased one of these in a store many years ago. I loved it and got many refills. However over the last few years I no longer saw them in my stores or the refills. So I was using the old bottles to refill with another kind of liquid oil. It just was not the same. Have purchased many things from Amazon and thought let's see if they have these Oust fans and lo and behold they did. I purchased 4 of them and my house is once again smelling like it use to years ago. I just hope to be able to get the refills in the near future. I like that they are battery operated and I can take them into any room. If I don't want the scent coming out I can easily turn them off for a few hours and turn it back on when I want them to cycle again. In my opinion well worth the purchase. Thanks Amazon so glad I found them again.
