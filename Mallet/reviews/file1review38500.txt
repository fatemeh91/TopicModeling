review/text: I love my epilator. I have owned this for about six months and my legs have never felt smoother. I had patches by my ankles that I would have to shave everyday. Now I use the epilator once every 8-10 days and my legs no longer feel stubbly, the hair is baby soft. My skin is very sensitive and as long as I use soothing lotion after, I have no problems with irritation. Great product!EDIT 07-14-2010.I recently replaced my Emjoi with another epilator, biggest waste of money ever. My old worn out Emjoi did a better job than this brand new Braun. The new one breaks off more hair than it pulls and my hair grows back in stubbly - just like shaving.If in doubt, buy the Emjoi with the caveat that the Emjoi Optima is too bulky for optimal use underarms and in the bikini area (can be done, but not easily).
