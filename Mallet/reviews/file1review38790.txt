review/text: I've been using the slim fast shakes for about 7 months now and have hands down loved the Chocolate Royale flavor. While I enjoy the other flavors I've found that this is the only one I really look forward to drinking in the morning. I, like everyone else, was pretty upset when the slim fast company significantly raised their prices on their canned shakes by putting them in a plastic bottle. However, I've found the shakes the be really helpful, not just for my weight loss, but as a great quick breakfast.I have always been the type of person who cannot function without breakfast, but I am also the person who is running out the door the last minute I need to leave in the morning. These shakes have made my morning struggle much easier because breakfast is easy and a no brainer.I loved my shakes so I couldn't get rid of them and opted to try out the mix powder. I simply add the milk and powder to one of those power-ball shakers (usually used for protein shakes) mix it up and drink it in the car. I find the power-ball shakers make the shake very frothy and oh so yummy!A MUCH cheaper alternative to the bottled version and SOOO much better when shaken up.
