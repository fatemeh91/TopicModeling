review/text: As other reviews state, this Panasonic ER112BC works great on nose hair. No pulling or pain. However, I have found it useless for ear hair and will have to buy another product for that. I have found that the long flat-blade style trimmers (instead of the rotary trimmers like this one) work best on ear hair.
