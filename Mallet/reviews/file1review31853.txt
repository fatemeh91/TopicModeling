review/text: Up until now I've only used alcohol based aftershaves, but I decided to try this for a change.What I like is that the smell is pleasant, really pleasant. It strikes a nice balance between being too weak and overpowering.What I don't like is the lack of any kind of sensation when I put it on. No burning, no cooling, no relief. It just feels like I'm rubbing on a scented lotion. It also leaves an oily residue on your skin.Really it's just preference. I can see how other people prefer this product, but not me.
