review/text: This is about the best Stocking Aid device out there in that it is simple to use,durable(they last for years,and relatively inexpensive. I bought this one for one of my patients but I use one myself as I had a total hip replacement several years ago. For individuals with reduced range of motion in their hip they can put a sock on quicker than someone with more dexterity. This is a Godsend.
