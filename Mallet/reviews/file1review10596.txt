review/text: I purchased these as a healthy lunch substitute or afternoon snack. The bars are tasty and very filling. They don't have any strange aftertastes, plus they are not full of sugar like some bars. I do not live the RAW life style, but these bars are perfect for vegans, raw vegans, or anyone just wanting a healthy snack/light meal substitute. I was extremly happy with them, so I am ordering another pack.
