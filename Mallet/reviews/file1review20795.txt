review/text: I finally bought a new Shaver after the battery on my 5400 died. This one is a great improvement. Alot quieter and easier to hold. My 5400 was narrow. I find the wider 8585 easier to handle. In my opinion, the 8585 shaves alot better than my 5400. I've read on other reviews that there is really no improvement, but I've noticed a great improvement. I also use my 8585 to shave my head and it does a much better job than my 5400 in that I dont have to swipe the same area several times. I only give 4 stars because of the price. I think they can come down another 50 dollars.
