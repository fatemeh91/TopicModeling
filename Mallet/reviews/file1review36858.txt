review/text: I purchased the Sock Aid because my left hip joint is so badly damaged that I can hardly bend over to put a sock on my foot (or tie my shoes, for that matter). The Sock Aid allows me to comfortably put the sock on the affected foot with ease. I will be using the Sock Aid for some time to come as I recover from hip replacement surgery . I highly recommend the product for those who find putting on socks a difficult task ... and the price is right.
