review/text: I almost expected this to taste absolutely terrible based on some of the reviews. However, I've been into 'natural products' for more than 30 years and not all of them taste like ice cream. The best way to take the Perfect Food is to get a quart jar, put 6-8 ounces of bottled water in it, add some ice, shake it up and drink. You don't have to hold your nose or add fruit juice; it doesn't taste bad at all. And think what it's doing for your health. Greens are probably the best foods we can consume.
