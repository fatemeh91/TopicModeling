review/text: this product didn't come sealed, I thought it was the law to seal all drug bottles including supplements. I tired a little of it (even though I shouldn't have, but I couldn't even drink it because it was so sour tasting. If I die it's because this product poisoned me. I'm not happy at all. cannot even use it because I'm too scared to. what a waste of money.
