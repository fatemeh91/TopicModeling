review/text: I've been a devoute Dermalogica user for years and held a Dermalogica certification at one point. So I should have known better- although it says for all skin types, this really isn't the best if you have mostly oily skin. It feels great at first, but the lathery composition of the face wash strips the oils which results in a little oil overproduction. My skin had cleared up after using Dermal Clay for so long, I thought I was in the clear. But after about 3 weeks of using this, I started breaking out badly again. For normal skin types, this is an excellent, lightweight cleanser. But for oily or acne-prone skin, try Dermal Clay.
