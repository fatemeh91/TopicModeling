review/text: My OB wanted me to take a prescription. I checked the ingredients on those vs these & was blown away. The Rainbow Light has more o what you need in one pill. There was no after taste, no constipation, no gas. There are even ingredients to help with the normal tummy issues you get while pregnant. Love them!
