review/text: I only ever buy Tweezerman Tweezers. They are the best tweezers and worth the extra money. This product is the same quality that I have come to expect, and were such a good deal. They are smaller but the tips and the feel of it are exactly the same as the $20 + full size. What a deal, I'm going to come back and pick up some more.
