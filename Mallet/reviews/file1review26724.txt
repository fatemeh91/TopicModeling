review/text: I've been taking this protien on and off for about 5 years and still to this date have not found any whey protien that beats the value. You will find some other powders out there that will taste better, but if you experiment with the amount of water or milk you mix with this, i'm sure you can find a taste you like. My goal for whey protien in a day is about 100 grams on training days. I train 5 days a week and this bag lasts me 2 months. So if you are on a budget, this is the best value out there.
