review/text: I am not impressed with this razor. It is fine for thinning back my goatee and moustache, but it does a lousy job of trimming the line on my moustache. The one positive I can mention is that it holds a charge for a long time and isn't as noisy as other trimmers I've had. I would not recommend this to anyone - I prbably should have returned it but I used it and waited too long.
