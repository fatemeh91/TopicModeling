review/text: Both a co-worker and myself started taking NV Rapid Weight Loss to kick start our diets because we needed the energy boost for the exercise. It did work for the both of us BUT it worked only because we started eating healthier and exercised regularly while taking the pills. I would recommend them to anyone who is serious about losing weight in a healthy way. People have to remember that this is NOT a miracle pill that will make you lose weight by itself. It worked as an energy booster and to curve my appetite. I lost a total of 48lbs in 4 months and have kept it off for 2 years so far. My co-worker lost 20lbs and has also kept it off for 2 years.
