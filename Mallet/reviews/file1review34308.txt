review/text: I have Crohn's disease and have a built-in sensitivity to dairy I didn't used to have. As long as I'm not eating half a pizza or having something with Alfredo sauce, one or two Say Yes to Dairy pills keeps me normal. This of course is when I am mostly in remission with occasional flare-ups. I don't have the really bad symptoms of Crohn's that some people have. My boyfriend has garden variety lactose intolerance, and they work for him, too, provided the dairy isn't too heavy.
