review/text: The taste is pretty good, 7/10, but it starts to get old about half way through the jug.I've tried most of the ON flavors but this one foams up more than the rest of them for reasons unknown, even in water.It will clump up a lot if you don't shake it pretty hard. The down time is a pain in the ass, waiting for the foam to settle.
