review/text: I got these at the direction of my doctor for plantar fasciitis. I tried them on and had immediate relief.The only downside I've found is that they are thick and cannot be used in most of my shoes. They do fit great in my mountain sandals, which are open in the front and back. They do not move and have never slipped out.
