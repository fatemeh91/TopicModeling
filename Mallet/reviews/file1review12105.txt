review/text: I really love these! They don't upset my stomach. I take one at night with dinner and have never felt sick from them. Also, the probiotics in them really help to prevent pregnancy constipation. This is my third pregnancy using them and I have yet to have that issue. I recommend them to all of my friend's and anyone who asks. Great product!
