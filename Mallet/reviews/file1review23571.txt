review/text: The quality of this mirror is great. It saddens me to have to return it because the magnification circle at the bottom of the mirror gets in the way and leaves very little room to see myself in the mirror when I apply makeup. If it didn't have this circle at the bottom, I'd definitely keep the mirror. The lighting is ok, although could be brighter, but you fix this issue by making sure you add other light sources when doing your makeup. I love the touch feature to increase the lighting and the 10X magnification mirror on the other side. Very sturdy, good quality but unfortunately, will have to go back. I'm going to return it and get a mirror without the magnification circle at the bottom.
