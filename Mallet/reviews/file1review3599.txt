review/text: Love this stuff, it is the best lubricant I have ever used. It is great for all areas that need a little lubricant. Lasts a long long time and only a few drops will do the job (unless its a marathon session). Slick and slippery without the sticky mess you get from water soluble lubes. This is silicone and its the best. A little more money up front, but will last much longer than anything else so the value is outstanding. Pay the money and you'll see that its worth its weight in gold.
