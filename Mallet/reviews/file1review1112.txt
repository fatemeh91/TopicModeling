review/text: I am very pleased with these elbow supports. I had previously worn the ace brand supports for years but had to find a new alternative when the velcro gave out. The futuro provides the support I was looking for with my moderate pain in both arms. They also stay put. The only reason I gave 4 stars is that after wearing all day at work and sweating in them, the blue pad leaves a stain on my arms. It usually comes off in the shower however.
