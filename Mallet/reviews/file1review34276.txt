review/text: First let me say I have never, ever written a review about anything but I am so compelled to write it about this. I have been dealing with HUGE internal and external hemorrhoids for years and over the last 9 months have gotten so bad that my quality of life has plummeted!! Like alot of other I have tried EVERYTHING!!! Spending $1000s of dollars on creams, suppositories, remedies, herbal supplements, etc with NO RELIEF and NO BENEFIT!!! I was ready for the surgery (dreaded hemorrhoidectomy)but the surgeon didn't want me to have to go through a second surgery just yet (as I had to have a fissurectemy and the pain was awful) and wanted to give me another month or two to recover and regain my strength.Anyway, I kept doing more and more research and came across this cream and decided I have nothing to lose. After only 2 applications the "putrid" or unhealthy tissue is actually starting to fall off and I can feel it working JUST AS DECRIBED!!! IT'S REALLY WORKING!!! I am in complete shock and am so happy that it's given me faith that this will actually work for me.As for the other reviews, they're Absolutely ON TARGET. Immediate cooling relief and makes things SO comfortable down there and you can actually feel it removing the heat and feel it working. Whoever, came up with this....GOD BLESS YOU for giving me hope that I had all but lost!! Thank you Thank you!!!!
