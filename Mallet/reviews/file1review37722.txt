review/text: Mitchum Clear Gel Anti-Perspirant is an effective deodorant. The ""perk"" to this product is that it does not stain or mark up your clothes, as do many deodorants and anti-perspirants. I noticed marked improvement in effectiveness. My underarms remained absolutely dry -- not an experience I've had with similar products. I would definitely recommend this because of its price and effectiveness/efficiency.
