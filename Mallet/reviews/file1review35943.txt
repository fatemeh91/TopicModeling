review/text: This toothbrush is awesome! It gets my teeth so clean that it feels like I've just had a visit to the dentist every time I brush. I used to have a Sonicar toothbrush and was planning to get another one. I decided to research "ionic toothbrushes" online and found Dr. Tung's toothbrush for $19 and decided to give it a try (the Sonicare costs $90). Another great thing about this brush is that you don't have to charge it. It doesn't take up any more space than a regular toothbrush. You can check the battery life by pressing the end of the handle and a red light flashes to let you know it's still got "juice". The battery life is estimated to last one year (you get two brush heads with the toothbrush), after which you discard and buy a new brush. Apparently the battery is too complicated to replace as it is sealed in ultra waterproof tight. Overall I am very pleased with this product and have bought as gifts for family and spouse. Every one loves it!!
