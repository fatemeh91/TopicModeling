review/text: Tend Skin is retailed at high end salons for people who wax to help with ingrowns, bumps and redness. My husband swears this is just over priced alcohol in a fancy bottle. But after a single use, even he noticed a difference in his skin before and after shaving. He uses Tend Skin daily twice a day and I have yet to see his face or neck get red like it used to.
