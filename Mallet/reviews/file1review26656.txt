review/text: This back support is very convenient to move around from location to location. It has helped me in long driving trips. Right when I get out of the car, I'm not stretching out my back like I'm sore or anything. The strap is wraps pretty tight around almost any chair, so it doesn't move around too much which is great. I think for the price, it's a great deal.I give it a 4 star rating because it's just basic versus some of the very fancy back supports out there. But it definitely gets the job done.
