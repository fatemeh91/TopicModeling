review/text: I used to have a big cardboard box full of foot products for my smelly feet. My feet were not only horrible smelling, they perspired and were almost unbearably uncomfortable and itchy especially in nylons. I also used to have to throw away perfectly good shoes because I couldn't get the odor out of them. NO MORE! Lavilin Foot Deoderant has solved years/decades of this problem. It's so easy to use and after a while, you don't need to apply it and your feet are still dry and odor free. Worth every penny and more.
