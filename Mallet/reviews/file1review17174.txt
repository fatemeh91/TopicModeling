review/text: This product is exactly what its made out to be. I purchased this trimmer for the price and the simplicity, so far it has meet all my expectations. It has a variety of different trimming lengths and the option to take of the guard for a closer shave. Although there are some reviews saying if you drop it, it will break, I have not found it to be so fragile.If you are looking for something that will do the bare essentials for a great price, this is your bargain!
