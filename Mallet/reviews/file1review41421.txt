review/text: I loved the scent when it's first put on. Then within an hour or two the scent subsides. And the lotion is very watery. I don't like that. Jean Paul's stuff is usually great. This stuff is fair. I won't purchase anymore of this brand from Amazon again. I think maybe I should have ordered from Overstock and maybe the quality of merchandise would have been better. But you learn as you go. LOL.
