review/text: I work 12h midnight shifts and need to find ways of getting better sleep so I bought this mask to try. I like the fact that it has indents for the eyes, but for me, I can still see a little light on the bridge of the nose. I've tried to move it around but there's still light. I think there needs to be some type of metal bracket there to pinch close to the nose that would work I think. It does work decent enough though for the price.
