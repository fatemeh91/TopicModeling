review/text: I take one of these almost every day, and I feel better on the days that I remember to take it than the days that I don't. The small pills dissolve pretty quickly and surprisingly they taste a lot like candy. Because they contain no sugar I was concerned that they would taste like a vitamin- which is sometimes horrible.I have had a gastric bypass and because of this my body does not absorb b-12 from food, this works for me.I love that Twinlab is made in American Fork, Utah.I also take 2 Twinlab Men's Ultra Daily capsules a day, and I have been a happy user of Twinlab supplements for over 10 years. It is a brand I trust.
