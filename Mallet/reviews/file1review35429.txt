review/text: I live in a town with very hard water. After years of calcium carbonate building up in my dishwasher, someone recommended I try this product. My dishwasher wasn't cleaning very well before and was leaving a film on my glasses and other dishes.After using this product once, I've already noticed a big improvement and wow, my dishes are actually clean.I also heard that the best dishwasher detergent to use is Finish and to also use Jet Dry. The combination of all three products seems to working swell.If you are having issues with that white filmy residue, I recommend giving this a try.
