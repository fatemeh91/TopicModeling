review/text: I applied the tide to go stick to a chocolate stain on my 100% cotton t-shirt. I looked down 45 minutes later and there was a huge hole where I applied the product. I was at school and had a huge hole over my stomach, it was embarrassing to say the least. I called them and they reimbursed me %75 of the cost of my shirt. They also offered me a coupon for another stick, I said "no thanks" to the coupon; I won't be using their product again!
