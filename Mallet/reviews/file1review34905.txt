review/text: I'm a long time melatonin user, and it has always worked to help me fall asleep. Recently I started waking up in the middle of the night. I found this time release melatonin, and it works really well. I still fall asleep fast, and now I don't wake up in the middle of the night. FYI, it also contains 10 mg (500% RDA) of Vitamin B-6.
