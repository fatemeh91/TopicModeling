review/text: I have been using Dymatize for over a year now and LOVE it. It mixes better than any other proteins I have tried and doesnt make my stomach upset. I am surprised to hear people complain about this protein. Its the only protein I will EVER buy and recommend it to everyone. The only time I had problems with this protein is when I would mix two scoops for after my workout and became very gasey. I weigh only 165 lbs so two scoops afterwards is WHEY to much protein.
