review/text: After usingRainbow Light Womens One, Just Once Multivitamin, 150 Tabletsfor over a year and really feeling good taking them, except for stomach upset if I didn't take them with food, I went off the Rainbow Light brand and triedGNC WOMEN's Ultra Mega 90 Caplets. I made the switch thinking that the GNC product would be better for my change in lifestyle; I had began exercising 4x's a week lifting heavy weights and running. Unfortunately the shift in vitamins also coincided with a change in my life in the form of perimenopause. Hot flashes, night sweats, moodiness, bloating and other associated hormonal changes made me feel 'less than happy', and the GNC vitamins seemed to be doing nothing to help.Remembering the Rainbow Light One and how good I felt while taking it, I went to the Rainbow Light website. There I found a questionnaire which after taking it recommended that I take the Rainbow Light Women's Nutritional System Multivitamin instead of the 'One', as the Nutritional System offers 'hormone balancing' herbs as a component of this plant-based vitamin. I thought it was worth a try!Rainbow Light's Women's Nutritional System promises to 'ease common PMS symptoms including mood swings, fatigue, breast tenderness and cramping. It also features three components essential to breast and bone health: vitex, vitamin D and calcium.After 3 weeks of being on this vitamin I'm not sure its hormone balancing claims are accurate (thus the 4-star review), but I'm hopeful and will certainly change my review to a 5 star if my issues clear up in the future while taking this vitamin. I know it takes time to get into my system and so I'm being vigilant in my taking of the vitamins (yes, 6 a day is a lot, but easy to take on either an empty stomach or with food and each pill is about 1/2 the size of the 'One'...) and hoping balance will occur soon. I think a 90 day trial run with these vitamins should be a good test of whether or not they work for 'hormone balancing' and will update this review at that time.I like that they are not huge and don't upset my usually fussy gut. I also trust the brand, and their knowledge of what a woman needs in a multivitamin. I notice no bad taste to this vitamin, but in all honesty, it's not in my mouth all that long before I wash it down with a big glass of water.I'm not crazy about taking 6 pills a day, but it's not hard to do once you get into the routine of it. The reason for 6 is pretty simple: these are water-soluble, plant based vitamins that flush through your system as you drink water and urinate. Taking 2 every few hours throughout the day, keeps them in your system versus the 'time release' variety which work the same way, but stay longer in your gut - potentially causing stomach and gastro-intestinal issues.Overall, I'm very pleased with the vitamins and am glad I switched back to them. Amazon's pricing is the best I've found and with or without hormone balancing, I feel like my body is getting a good dose of what I need to keep it healthy and active.Ingredients in Rainbow Light's Women's Nutritional System per serving of 6 tablets, per package:Vitamin A, 5000 IU - 100% recommended daily valueVitamin C, 600mg - 1000%Vitamin D, 1000 IU - 250%Vitamin E, 200 IU - 667%Vitamin K, 30 mcg - 37% **not found in all multivitamins; significantly less than in RL's Women's One.Vitamin B-1, 30mg - 2000%Riboflavin (B-2), 35mg - 2050%Niacin, 80mg - 400%Vitamin B-6, 40 mg - 2000%Folic Acid, 800 mcg - 200%Vitamin B-12, 144 mcg - 2400% **Super high in B-12 for energy.Biotin, 600 mcg - 200%Vitamin B-5, 80 mg - 800%Calcium, 1200mg - 120% **NO additional calcium needed.Iron, 18mg - 100% **No additional needed.
