review/text: I use it to clean a narrow neck stainless steel water bottle I bought on here. Does a good job. I wouldn't be able to clean the bottle without it so it is worth every penny. It is basically a small toilet brush. But it works... just don't use it on the toilet then to clean bottles with! :-)
