review/text: At 30 cents a piece (=60 cents a pair), these Memorex batteries are good alkaline batteries. However, don't expect to use them in digital cameras, as they won't last long. For digital cameras that take AA you should use NiMH rechargeable batteries. The Memorex is great for other electronics such as CD players, MP3 players, portable radios, etc.
