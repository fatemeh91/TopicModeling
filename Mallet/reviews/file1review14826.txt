review/text: I was surprised to find the new replacement filter did not have the same design as the original. The original filters, when I purchased the Air Cleaner, have a rubbery gasket that surround the filter to keep dust from slipping through the outside edge. The new replacement filter is just a cardboard frame that snuggly fits in the unit. I suppose it still seals enough to prevent dust from being blown back into the air.I gave it 5 stars because it does filter the air like it's designed to. This was one of few places that I was able to find this filter. I was very surprised that Whirlpool themselves don't stock it any longer under their parts list.I think I paid around $35.00 for this filter. That's a little steep to stock up on them, just in case the unit should stop working. I guess I just have to hope the filter is available again next year!
