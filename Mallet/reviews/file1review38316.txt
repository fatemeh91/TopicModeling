review/text: I bought this product shortly after my son was born - with no time to do anything other than take care of him, my beauty regime was out the door and my hair removal schedule was no existant. It took me a full week to get the courage to try it on myself. The thing looks terrifing and I was sure that little bits of skin would be getting pulled out. The noise does not help either - same with the power of such a little device. But my husband put the tweezing section right up to the palm of his hand to show me it was perfectly safe. A big swallow and 10 minutes later my legs were hair free and smooth. This epilator works and works well. I am a seasoned waxer and used to wax myself on a regular basis. No more. This is worth the cost because it will save you time! On top of that, it is far more effective. Waxing used to leave behind little tiny hairs that I would have to go in and pull one by one. Or I would miss a whole section, causing me to have to heat everything up again, get the strips out, etc. Now with this, just plug it in, zip zip like a razor and you are done - without the stubble or little hairs cause this will get them out. It takes a bit of practice on the knees and round areas but it works. I highly recommend this product and can't believe I have not bought one sooner - or why anyone would want to wax again after this. It is far less painful, far less messy, far less of a hassle and works much better! If you are on the fence about it, take it from me, buy this product and you will be glad you did.
