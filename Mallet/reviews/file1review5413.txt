review/text: I checked out all of the reviews on ear thermometers before buying this one, figuring I could just return it to the retailer if it didn't work. I was using a pharmacy brand rectal thermometer with my 15 month old son and it would always give us vastly different readings every time, up to a 2 degree difference, and I wanted something that was ACCURATE. As long as it was, I was willing to spend more.I was not disappointed with this. I knew my son was running a temperature by his temperament and feeling his forehead. The rectal thermometer read 103.1, 102.4, and 101.9 when taken three consecutive times. Right out of the package the Braun ear thermometer read 101.6, 101.6, 101.5, 101.5. I took mine and it read as 98.8, 98.5, 98.5. MUCH better than my old thermometer and it took a fraction of the time. Not to mention it's much easier to get than a rectal temp, and I look forward to seeing just how easy that will be when we need to use it in the middle of the night!No, the screen doesn't light up for night time use. Oh well. If the thermometer remains this easy to use and maintains its accuracy, then I think I can easily deal with that.
