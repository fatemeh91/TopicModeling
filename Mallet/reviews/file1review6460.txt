review/text: This product is everything it claimed to be and more. I had been going to a chiropractor for a couple of weeks without lasting results. As a rehab nurse I was looking for a way I could be more active in my treatment. A physical therapist with whom I work let me use a similar product and I was very pleased with it. I looked online and found this product which was more versatile and offered more "little knobs" for greater trigger point release. I am very satisfied with the Back body buddy and have already recommended it to friends and co-workers. Note: it looks a little odd so don't be surprised if you get questions about it.
