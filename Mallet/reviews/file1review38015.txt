review/text: This is in response to a few of the posters stating that Smoking, Lack of Exersize, Diet are the biggest risk-factors for a heart attack. That Statement is only partialy true.While Smoking, Exersize and Diet ARE risk-factors for a heart attack, the BIGGEST risk factor for heart attack is hereditary (Family History).I Work as an EMT and in the Transitional Care Unit (Cardiac Unit) of the hospital and probably half of the people we see in for heart attack dont smoke, exersize and have a fairly good diet, BUT have a family history of heart attack. - alot of them say "Why is this happening to me? I Ate right, exersized, did'nt smoke."So while yes, Smoking, Lack of Exersize and a Poor diet all increase the risk of having a heart attack, family history is still the biggest risk-factor of them all.
