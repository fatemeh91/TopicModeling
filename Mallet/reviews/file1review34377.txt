review/text: In the past I've found that adding MSM to my daily supplements greatly decreased arthritis discomfort, but then couldn't find the brand I liked anymore. I was eager to try this brand because each tablet has a high dose. I took one tab a day for a week, but then noticed I was very bloated as though I'd eaten too much salty food. I also didn't notice any decrease in pain which I had almost immediately before. This was a very short trial and not very scientific, but I decided to quit the product until the swelling subsided. It could possibly have been caused by something else.I plan to try the product again in a more controlled situation while I also keep my sodium intake from other sources low. I'll update if I get different results. It is worth saying though that the other brand seemed to make a difference in how I felt within a day or two and this one didn't. It may be metabolized differently and one needs a longer period to notice any change. Since I know MSM does help how my knees feel from my past experience, it seems worth a trial to see if it helps you.
