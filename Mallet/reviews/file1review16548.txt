review/text: my humble opinion:i was gonna wait a few days and put up this review on the first of the month and complain that it didn't have fluid and that there was a sticker on it that left a bunch of glue that only a wizard that was trained in dark magic could remove..oh! and the scratches...BUT, i figured i would have confused the slower folks. (get it?-april 1st?)*sigh*moving on>this is the deal of the century.an American made lighter with a lifetime guarantee shipped for free in 2 days (i have prime so you peasants... should step aside.) for under 10 bucks???i must have stepped off the bus in Crazytown (nice place).i would have bought 2 but why? if i don't lose it 1 will last a lifetime.-i love the build. it's an engineers dream. super simple and super functional.-i love the finish (street chrome). why? because standard chrome is too slippery and the girlies need to think i have change in my pocket (i don't--i used it to buy a zippo)-i love the smell. c'mon guys! admit it! zippo fumes and wd-40..the best smells ever!ain't life great? i submit that it is.my tips for a better zippo experience (take my advice at you own risk but this is what i do)-i keep it full but never overfull.i use only zippo or ronson fluids and flints.-i keep an extra flint under the felt and i only finger-tighten the flint screw-i dab an extremely small amount of superglue on the ends of the hinge pin to keep the pin from sliding out. the old sliding pin syndrome has shelved many a great zippo. it only takes a teeny little drop.too much and you'll get glue in the pin and mess up your rig, so don't do this unless you're slick.thats what i do. it's up to you if you want to.enjoy your lighter.i hope i helped.
