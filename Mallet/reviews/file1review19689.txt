review/text: We started with the seats that mount to the toilet. They were ok but this is so much more sturdy. The molded shape lets me feel like my 2 year old daughter is stable on the seat. They also pop out easily, with a pressure fit and easily adjustable dial. I'm a big fan and if you have any hesitation, don't. This is a simple, no-fuss quality product.
