review/text: Great seller and fast shipping, but product not useful at all. If you want cold, get an ice pack. If you want heat, get heat patches. If you want to keep re-heating a heavy awkward thing that must be sealed or even humidity will ruin it, then buy this piece of junk. The heat lasts 15 minutes at best. Useless.
