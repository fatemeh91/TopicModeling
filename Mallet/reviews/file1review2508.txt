review/text: I bought this item specifically because the voltage is listed as 120-240 on the norelco website indicating that if you had the right adapter you could use it in Ireland. I travel alot and wanted it for that purpose however, the transformer to plug it in is only 120. I assume I would likely ruin it if I tried to use it in Europe even though i have the proper adapters.
