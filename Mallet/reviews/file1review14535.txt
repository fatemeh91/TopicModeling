review/text: I put this on chronically dry and irritated patches of skin on my face by mistake a few months ago. Within 30 minutes the irritation was gone. Within 24 hours the dryness was gone. Within 3 days the skin was soft and clear. I have used this on my face every day since then and the acids in it have worked better on fine lines/wrinkles than the very expensive products I usually use.
