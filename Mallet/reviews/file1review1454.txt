review/text: These Scales are very accurate. I have checked them against calibrated scales where I work by weighing myself right before leaving work and as soon as i got home about 20 min. later. They were dead on. Also, they were a great value. You cannot beat the price. Electronic scales, contrary to popular belife, can be wrong. The scales I had before these were digital and were giving different weights. That is why I bought these. I know they are always right.
