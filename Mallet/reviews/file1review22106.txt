review/text: When my Magic Chef refrigerator was on the fritz, the repairman told me to junk it. The brand wasn't worth repairing or owning. It was a side by side. I have limited space in my trailer for a refrigerator and most side by sides won't fit.I discovered that side by side refrigerators are not the best value. The size of refrigerators are measured from their EXTERNAL measurements. Thus a 22 cubic foot side by side refrigerator will hold less than a 22 cubic foot freezer top refrigerator. This is because the side by side has a large internal wall compared to the freezer top.I liked Whirlpool, but had a budget so I obtained their low end model at Lowe's with free delivery and set up. I have had the unit for several years (longer than the Magic Chef that gave out) and haven't had any issues with it. In fact for the price that I paid for it, it will be cheaper to toss it and get a new one rather than repair it. Less than $300.00 at Lowe's includes delivery, set-up and carting off your old one.
