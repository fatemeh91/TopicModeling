review/text: so you can check out what scents you or your other like and get away w not liking all of them due to the fact the price is very solid...so far i have used 3 of the scents and they have been great..they act as a nice oil for massages as well as a nice moisturizer..they have mild and nice scent that lingers but is not overpowering..also it is easy to wash up for those applying the product..i recommend the product, and have fun...very nice product from kama sutra..i will def be getting some more of this...also look for the bath salts as a starter to this..you can have or reward someone with a wonderful night of relaxing and or excitement...
