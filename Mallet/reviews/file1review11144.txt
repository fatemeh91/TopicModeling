review/text: We have a cat so we go through lint rolls a lot and was tired of buying them. When we were at Target we were going to buy more and they were selling for $4.99 per refill roll. How obnoxious! I wasn't going to pay that! We looked around and this was the best price for refills. Now we are stocked for several months and only paid around $2.25 per roll.
