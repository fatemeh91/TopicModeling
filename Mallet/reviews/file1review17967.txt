review/text: I was really surprised by the quality of this stethoscope. I was looking for a second one to leave at my second job and it is at least as nice as my Littman, for a much better price. I really like the tubing better than my Littman which has gotten a little stiff over time. It's a little heavier then the Littman, but it just makes it fees like more of a quality piece than cumbersome. Really recommended!
