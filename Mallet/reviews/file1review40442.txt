review/text: I have used this lip balm for about 7 years and it's hands down the best. I've tried a lot of balms, too! You know that "lip scum" we all get? This lip balm actually gets rid of it, I don't know how. And unlike other lip balms that made you have to apply more and more, this lip balm moisturizes your lips in a way that stays longer, so you aren't constantly reapplying it. Lastly, I have a problem with getting itchy irritation from some skin products and this lip balm doesn't irritate my skin at all. Love love love it.
