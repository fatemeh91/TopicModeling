review/text: I bought this eye mask for travel and it could not be more perfect! Wish I had one sooner. It blocks out the light and is not tight on the face at all. The eye pockets allow you to blink and don't smash your eyes. The material is very soft and cushiony. I swear, with this and a pair of ear plugs, I could sleep anywhere! Highly recommend this product. (I just bought another one for back-up).
