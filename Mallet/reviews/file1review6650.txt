review/text: The product came in an extremely big box, much bigger than necessary. It's hard, flat plastic--I'm pretty sure it could have survived a trip through shipping without so much cardboard.When I opened the box, I didn't realize the backbuddy was so big! I'm only 5 feet, so it was a lot bigger on me than the girl in the pictures. I was really planning to return it because I didn't want something so big and clunky in my house.Besides that point, when I finally tried the BB, it worked wonders! Even with the size difference, I was able to adjust it so I could reach different places on my back. I was extremely impressed at the amount of pressure I could exert into the knots. I can finally exert the amount of deep tissue pressure I've always want in a massage. I woke up this morning feeling pain/soreness free. I'm sitting at my 8 hour desk job feeling very good and haven't had to pop any joints yet. I don't think I'll be mailing it back. I'll find some place to stash it.
