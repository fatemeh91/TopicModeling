review/text: About a year back, I started Tae Kwon Do. About a month back I started having knee pain. It was making life difficult. I would had to give us Tae Kwow Do. After my Doctor recommended a knee brace, I first used one from a local drug store. The big brace was not comfortable while exercising.The Cho-Pot Dual Action Keen Strap is very comfortable to use and has totally eliminated my knee pain. It provides stability and support while I have it on. More important, it eliminated the knee pain at other times.
