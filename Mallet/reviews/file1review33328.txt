review/text: This had all the requirements we needed - water-based and ships by Prime (a weak criterion, I know). Cherries didn't seem like a bad choice of scent, whereas the other flavors in this line were all quite unappealing to us. So I ordered the cherry. It smells like cherry cough syrup, or like the cherry liquid soap we used to use to clean out the pool bathrooms! Disgusting. Also, it is supposedly warming (according to the label), but it was not. In those two respects it was bad. However, the texture was good, and since it is water-based it's easy to clean up. The cherry scent seems to dissipate quite quickly, leaving an unscented product. We will continue to use it until it's gone, but if you are truly looking for something cherry-scented and warming, look elsewhere.
