review/text: I just received my WFR certification and wanted to stock my first aid kit with cravats (triangular bandages). Rather than making them, I thought I'd pick up this inexpensive box of 12 cravats. They are extremely thin and loosely-woven, to the point of seeming like tulle, but appear sturdy. For the price compared to the other cravats I looked at, these are good. Although I should've just gone to the local craft store and bought a length of fabric and cut it into 40x40x56 triangles, for the ease of buying, these are okay.
