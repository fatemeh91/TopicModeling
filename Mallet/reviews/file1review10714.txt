review/text: After a month of use, we are very pleased with this creative pill box idea. Each morning the day's pill box is set on the kitchen table. It is a reminder to take the pills for the day. The colors are helpful. I would recommend them to anyone whose needs can be met with the 4-times-a- day pill boxs. A satisfied Colorado consumer.
