review/text: After suffering with heart palpitations every day for almost a month (brought on by stress and anxiety), I began to research online and came across this product after reading about the benefits of magnesium. I have only been using this product for a few days but was so happy with seeing results so fast that I had to write a review.Let me first say I was having heart palpitations every 2-5 minutes, all day, every day ! After only 24 hours, my heart palpitations were cut in half ! After 48 hours, I am having a few here and there. Hopefully soon they will be completely gone. It also has done wonders for my anxiety in the short time I have been taking it. I feel much calmer and able to handle my nerves better. I take one 125mg in the morning and one in the evening.
