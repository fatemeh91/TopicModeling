review/text: I purchased this item as a Christmas gift for my husband. I waited almost a month for it to come in. I just received the shaver two days ago and I was thrilled because my husband really needed a real good shaver. Well, the next day, he tried it. It gave him a very close shave. I would say that the shave was excellent except for one problem. The shaver was extremely noisy. It sounded like a chain saw in his hand. You could hear him shave from all over the house including the outside. The noise the shaver was generating was just too much (it would drown out the television) so I regretably returned it back the next day and purchased a different Panasonic shaver - ES8003. This new shaver felt the same except the noise was nowhere as bad. I had to pay more money for the new shaver, but my husband is pleased and if he is pleased then I am pleased too. We would have kept the Panasonic ES8036N if it didn't make such a racket. My husband felt too uncomfortable shaving with such a noise maker (he was really embarrassed).
