review/text: Squish and stuff, reuseable, cheap, and they work.The cord that ties the two plugs together is made of very thin fibers that seem to catch on coarse fabric easily. If wearing any chest armor with velcro (like we use in Afghanistan) the cord will snag on the velcro - a plus, or a minus, depending.I used these in Afghanistan, mostly while travelling from one base to another in helicopters. They also muted out the ever-present drone of diesel generators and tent-mates at night.
