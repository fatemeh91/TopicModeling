review/text: I am 30 yrs old and my husband and I have been trying for a while now. I saw this product and the reviews seemed good so I bought it. I've always had regular cycles and if I'm late it's never more then a couple days. After taking this product not only did I not ovulate (I've been tracking with OPK's and BBT) but I've completely skipped my last period. That has NEVER happened to me! There is NO chance I am pregnant either. I saw my doctor and she recommended stopping it and simply taking prenatal vitamins.I am very disappointed.
