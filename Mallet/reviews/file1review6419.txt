review/text: I have owned the Body Back Buddy (formerly the Better Back Buddy) for at least 8 years, if not longer. I use it daily at home to help control my fibromyalgia muscle pain. I bought a new one for my office, where many of us use it to relieve our neck, shoulder and back muscle tension.This is the best self-help tool I have ever owned, and I highly recommend it to anyone who experiences body pain.
