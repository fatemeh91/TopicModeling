review/text: After reading all the reviews on this product and about how great it was about removing hair, I figured I give it a try!!! I was a little leary about some of the reviews mentioning that it was a little painful at first, so I mentally prepaired myself for that. I even plucked a few hairs from my leg with a tweezer before I ordered the item to see if I could stand the pain. Painful plucking was, but I hate shaving!NOW,not only did I get my package in a super fast delivery speed of only two days (Free shipping too.) But when It arrived and I tried it for the first time, it didn't hurt?!?!?! The individual tweezer plucking was ten times worse. Could I have been using it wrong? I wasn't cause I could actually see the little hairs with the routes on the epilator. LADY'S IF YOU ARE ON THE FENCE ABOUT IT BEING PAINFUL, TRUST ME, IT'S NOT THAT BAD AT ALL. I will warn you though, when I got to areas on my leg that had more fat on them, ie., inner thighs it stun a little, as long as you pull you skin taught though, you'll be fine!!! By the way IT WORKS, IT WORKS, IT WORKS. I AM EXTREMELY IMPRESSED! BRAVO TO THE INVENTOR. THIS IS A QUALITY PRODUCT! A+
