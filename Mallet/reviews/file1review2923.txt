review/text: This is a great idea but they've got it wired backwards in my opinion. Your hands have to stay under the detector for a few seconds for it to click on but if you so much as spread your fingers it detects the loss of your hands and shuts off instantly. This product would be a 5-star product if it worked the opposite where it would instantly start when your hands went under it but would take a few seconds to shut off afterwards or when it detects the hands are no longer there. That way it doesn't shut off when you move your hands away for half a second. Great idea, done wrong. Had to remove mine as it's useless the way it's currently programmed.
