review/text: I think ON 100% Whey Gold Standard really hits the sweet spot for value/taste/formulation/mixability. I am military and have to mix this with water and it mixes much easier than other protein I have tried with water. I love the vanilla ice cream flavor but am not a fan of the double rich chocolate with water. Some people have said it tastes good with milk and that may be true but with just water it has a odd flavor that isn't horrible but isn't very pleasant. I would suggest trying a few 1 or 2lb tubs of different flavors and then going for the value of a 5lb tub once you find what works for you.
