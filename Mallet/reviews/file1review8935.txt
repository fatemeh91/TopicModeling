review/text: I contacted Vibrant Health, the manufacturer of Green Vibrance, and they informed me the current version is 11.0. Amazon is selling version 10.3. Version 10.3 contains soy lecithin! The current version 11.0 contains lecithin from sunflowers, a safe form of lecithin, and no soy lecithin!! Vibrant Health also informed me they don't directly sell to Amazon and have no idea how Amazon is getting green vibrance! In the future I am only going to purchase fresh, current versions of Green Vibrance!!! I did an online chat with an Amazon representative and he informed me he has no way of telling what version Amazon is selling today. I bought mine 2months ago and a friend just bought some a week ago and both are version 10.3.
