review/text: I broke my wrist, and even now I need a brace from time to time. I like the braces that you pull over your hand, rather than the ones you wrap and clasp. I consider those bulky; with the ones I like you can even wear a watch over the brace ( although many people do not wear watches any longer), or you can conceal the brace under a long sleeved shirt.I order such a brace and believe me, they are hard to find. I ordered a small, but it was not small enough for my wrist, which measures 5 and 1/2 inches. It floated on my wrist and I thought, what can I do? So, I carefully, with a seam ripper, took apart the sewing that combines the two parts together. I cut off 1/2 inch, approximately, put some 2 tube style epoxy (the 5 minute kind) on the edges to toughen them up and when that was dry, I re-sewed the two pieces together following a similar pattern or sewing.It worked great! I love my new brace. I ordered a second one to be altered at a later date, if necessary.
