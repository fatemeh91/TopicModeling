review/text: I don't often get sick, but when I do, I am usually down for the count for a week and a half. It's awful.A few years ago, I had a really horrible flu. It started with being kinda sniffly... and the next day, I had a fever so bad my hair hurt and my eye sockets ached when I'd blink. A friend of mine told me to get some of this, come what may, because it "attacks sickness like a wolverine on angel dust."Fair enough.So I managed to get my mitts on some of this stuff (between naps - I slept 20 hours in a row). I took 3 immediately, 3 more when I woke up - and went back to sleep. When I woke up? Not even a lingering trace. I've sworn by it ever since.I regularly spend a lot of time on planes, and my colleagues are always coming down with some horrible plane-based grossness - I take a few of these during my travel, and I stay healthy. My honey has mono? I stack these up 2x a day, and I never got it (he wouldn't take 'em, silly thing).Yay, Bio-Align!
