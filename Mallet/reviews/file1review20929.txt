review/text: I went from a rotary norelco that tore my neck apart to a braun freeglider with the lotion to this activator. It's much lighter and more powerful than the freeglider. I use it to not only shave my face but head as well. I've never put a blade to my head and with this shaver I have no desire to.I've had the unit since may06. Put it in the cleaner base about once a week. Otherwise I'd brush it off throughly. One cleaning cartridge lasted 5 months. I just picked up some cutter blocks. They say 18 months but I shave twice as much area.I'd say I have sideways growing neck hair. The activator does much better at picking those up than the freeglider did. The shave is fairly quick. I suppose 5-8 minutes for the face and head. It is necessary to go over most areas more than once. This doesn't bother me since I have experienced very little irritation.I'm impressed with the lasting power. It runs strongly up until about 30 seconds before it completely dies. The freeglider noticeably degraded and ran at a lull for quite some time before it completely died. Since I run a week before I charge/clean the base always selects the intensive setting. The cleaning setting is directly related to the battery level. Low battery life equals intensive clean. No complaints about the cleaning process. It does a great job of conditioning the cutter.
