review/text: I love this deodorant. For a while I couldn't find it in the stores so I switched to the Smart Solid. That was not good. I formed black mole looking things under my arms (go figure, allergic, I guess). So I shopped around until I found it again. It is the only deodorant that doesnt make me stink like those with perfumes :-(. Now my daughter uses it so I am always trying to find new places to buy it from.
