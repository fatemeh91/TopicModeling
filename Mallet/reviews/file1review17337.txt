review/text: First off, I'd just like to say that I never review anything I buy on here.But this is one to brag about.I was looking for a beard trimmer to purchase for my brother for a christmas present, After reading review after review. I landed with this one in my cart. And he freaking loves it, last night he actually shaved his head with it and it looked really good. Im bragging about this product because it's less than 20 dollars and has better reviews than a 50 dollar one.No complaints here.
