review/text: This is BY FAR the best air spray ever made by Glade. I called Glade because I couldn't find it in stores for several months. They told me it's on "limited distribution" and obviously, I think that's a BIG mistake. It has a unobtrusive nice clean, fresh smell that removes all the bad odors in the house. I made a plea to Glade to keep making this great product.
