review/text: I teach a second grade class, and this has been the perfect tool for us to keep the classroom clean between vacuumings. It even picks up pencil shavings! The only problem I've had with it is the handle. All the parts come apart. We fixed it up with some tape and haven't had any problems since though. It gets passed around to all the classrooms on my floor and it still works fabulously (except that the brush got lost somewhere).
