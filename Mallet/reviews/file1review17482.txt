review/text: I should have known this thing would fall apart quickly from the price point.Pluses: cheap.Minuses: Poor battery life- held charge for 1-2 uses max; the clipper head was constantly falling off; trimmer guard length apparatus finally broke, rendering this thing mostly useless.Stay away from this one, spend a little more money and get something higher quality that will last you more that six months.
