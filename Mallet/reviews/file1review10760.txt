review/text: This product is so compact and portable, I love it! It doesn't take up a lot of space and yet the compartments are large enough to fit large supplements like Flax Seed Oil - they're huge! I have to admit that the compartment doors aren't always easy to open, and I broke one the first time I tried. Not a big deal, and I would highly recommend this product. It also helps that each day is a different color and the compartments are clearly labeled with each day.
