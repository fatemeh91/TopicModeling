review/text: I bought the cherry flavor from another website after reading all the rave reviews. One woman wrote in saying it tastes like a cherry sucker, so after reading that I made my purchase.Value:Includes all the flavors goodHead makes. This product may seem high at $15 but it's actually cheaper per ounce than the big tubes, so it's a good value & a good starter pack for someone who doesn't know which they would prefer. The full size tubes seem to last forever, i've used it many many times.Flavor & Texture & UseThis product really does taste good. You don't need much of it, just a thin layer, otherwise it can taste a little chalky. It's thick coming out the tube, so to apply just get a little dab on your finger & rub it where ever you want to taste it, rub it in like a lotion to prevent it from being chalky. Can be used for him or her & it makes a great gift.This product is another great one by doc johnson.
