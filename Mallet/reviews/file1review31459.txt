review/text: this product was heaven sent for me, i swear. i have never waxed anything and for my first time doing it at home, i gotta say im glad i found this and bought it before spending money at the salon. lol i was about to give up on this product while doing my first underarm but then i realized that i wasnt pulling the wax in the right direction, ooops. it works wonders when done right, if you are not satisfied with this you must be doing something wrong because IT WORKS, i have crazy thick/coarse hair EVERYWHERE and this product took it all out straight from the root.. give it a chance to work for you :)
