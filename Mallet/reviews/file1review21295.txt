review/text: So you've read the reviews about how this is a great toothbrush that does the job and your teeth will be clean. This review chooses to focus on the color scheme of this Oral-B unit. I chose to rate this product with five stars. If I had the option, I would specifically rate this a 4.9, less than a perfect score, solely because of the questionable color plastics chosen for this toothbrush. To start it off, the front of the handle was made aquamarine. This hideous color should not match any sane person's bathroom decor. But if that wasn't bad enough, the back of the handle is a repugnant seafoam green color. Between these varying shades of hideousness, a strip of cerulean blue flake plastic accents the toothbrush. The brush head itself has a ring of royal blue around the neck, and the back of the brush head is cornflower blue. Of course, the bristles themselves are yet another random shade of blue. In conclusion, this is a very solid product that is held back by the fact that it looks like a hodgepodge of different color plastics, none of which come anywhere near matching or aethsetically pleasing. Why can't they just make this toothbrush a simple black, white, or any solid color? I recommend this product to anyone who wants clean teeth and can't decide between the color green or blue.
