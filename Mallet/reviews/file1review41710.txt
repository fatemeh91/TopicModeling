review/text: This is a great toothbrush. If your going to get one- get the best. I never had an electric toothbrush before and I have to say that every time I brush- I feel like I just came from the dentist. Before using this- some days- depending on what I ate or drank- i would just feel like I had this plaque on the back of my teeth that I just couldnt get off. They should name this thing the plaque blaster! I no longer have that nitty gritty surface on my teet after brusing. Its amazing that it recognizes the different brush styles when you change them. Definately a good product, I have not had one issue or regret with it. I thought I would completely eliminate the old skool toothrbrush from my bathroom- the truth is- I still use it to brush my tongue.Hah!
