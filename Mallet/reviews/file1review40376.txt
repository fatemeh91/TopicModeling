review/text: I am all for natural and herbal remedies and health supplements. Why not dose up on good stuff if you feel like you're coming down with something? In fact, I was quite pleased to add Gaia's Quick Defense to my medicine cabinet. While certainly not a miracle cure, the Quick Defense system is a way to bolster the body's immune system. Primary ingredients include Echinacea, Black Elderberry, Ginger extracts and Andrographis.Again, I must stress that this is not intended nor does it act as a cure-all. Your body still has to do the work. The ingredients here just MIGHT help it along.Personal Experience: This weekend, I started sneezing up a storm which did initiate a number of other head cold symptoms. I used Quick Defense and nothing further developed. Did it prevent the onset of illness? Were my allergies just exacerbated and I overreacted? Would things have cleared up on their own? I don't honestly know the answer. But was it worth it?What did surprise me was the dosage recommendation. The bottle I received contained 20 pills. The recommended dose is 2 pills, 5 times daily, for 2 days (repeat if necessary). That is one (or two) entire bottles at the onset of a potential illness! It is a product that may or may not help you prevent something that may or may not be oncoming. That's an enormous commitment for most people. Financially, I don't think I could or would drop around $20, give or take, because I feel a sore throat or sniffles coming on. KGHarris, 2/12.
