review/text: This beard trimmer does a great job, but all of that is overshadowed by a dud battery. I have to plug this in the night before I plan to use it EVERY time (even if I want to use it the following day). The battery that came with mine never lasted more than about 15 minutes, which was really disappointing. Maybe I got a dud, but I wish I had returned for a refund right away instead of hoping it'd work better
