review/text: I have owned many beard and mustache trimmers over the last 30 years and this is the best I have owned. It is easy to use, cuts beards and mustaches to the desired length without slipping and cutting too close. It is also has a powerful motor so there is no pulling. I would highly recommend this product and would purchase again without hesitation.
