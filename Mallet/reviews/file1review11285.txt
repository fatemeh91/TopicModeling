review/text: I bought this at a Health Food Store because of an infection that prescription medication didn't work. (***For all people who may not be informed, these capsules are a suppliment and have nothing to do with baking or cooking yeast, nor does this product have yeast in it, this product is listed on this site under 'Candida and Yeast Support'.) As a woman, I found that this product worked VERY well for me, and helped a lot with the infection I had. At first I took 6 capsules a day and the infection got significantly better; after that when I was feeling a bit better, I forgot the second dose of 3 capsules for a few days and once I realized it, I was still doing fine. With 6/day, it pretty much helped clear it up, and with 3/day, it helped to maintain my health. After buying one 90 capsule bottle, I quickly bought a 180 capsule bottle. I love this suppliment and will continue to buy it. I also love that you can feel it working (not in a bad or uncomfortable way), it's reassuring to feel it work... I recommend this to anyone...and I didn't even use it with Acidophilus (though I don't know that using both would make a difference)...I had recurring problems with my female health, and this really made a difference. Buy it, you won't regret it!!
