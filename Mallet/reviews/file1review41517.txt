review/text: This is a nice sturdy product. It is well made and came w/many attachments for hair length. I use it all the time on two of my dogs and I am not a groomer. It helps to keep them clipped short on dog hair around the house. This was a great purchase and the price was right. I don't know why I waited so long to buy it.
