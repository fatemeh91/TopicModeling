review/text: We all know that brushing our teeth is important. Yet, sometimes it can still feel like a chore when we're rushed in the morning or ready to go to bed at night. Thus, the "little things" in teeth care products are often what make the difference between brushing sporadically vs. on a daily basis.For me, this toothpaste is "the one" for two reasons:1. Great tasting. Likely because of the Scope, this toothpaste has a very pleasant taste. It isn't chalky or bland like other varieties I've tried.2. Feels fresh. I'm not a dentist, so I can't tell you the exact ion formulation that produces this feeling and gets the teeth clean, but suffice it to say that my mouth just feels fresh after I brush with this paste.Here's the way I view this product: Even on the nights I just want to roll into bed or roll out the door without brushing, this Crest toothpaste (due to its clean sensation and great taste) is one of those "little things" that make oral hygiene that much easier to set aside a little time for.
