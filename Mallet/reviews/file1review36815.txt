review/text: I had high dose radiation to my left hip in January of this year, and one of the the side effects can be muscle fibrosis (scarring) and edema (swelling) in the area treated. I am currently undergoing physical therapy to deal with this, and one of the most frustrating and difficult situations this has put me in has been the inability to bend over on my left side. Putting on a sock became increasingly more and more difficult and painful and, quite frankly, is now impossible. There were two days I simply did not go into work, not because of symptoms, but because as a person who lives alone, I could not get my left sock on. (Wearing footwear without socks is not permitted in my workplace.) It was enough to bring tears of frustration each morning.I reviewed this device, and decided to give it a shot, and it has literally changed my life. I can know put on any sock of my choosing on my affected side in a matter of minutes. The construction and material is very solid, and the straps are long enough. I am 6'3" and can't really reach below my knee right now, and I have no issue whatsoever pulling my sock up. I also have fairly wide feet, and the hard plastic, yet flexible, shell fits my foot with total ease.I highly recommend this device to anyone who may need the additional assistance of getting their socks on. I would have gladly paid many times its selling price for the degree of independence this product provides.
