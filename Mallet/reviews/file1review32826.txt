review/text: I, for a long time, have used the Strawberries N Cream shakes in cans for breakfast and 10am snack. After they were discontinued this year, I had to buy this powder. I also had to buy it when I went on a trip to Canada. With water it tastes kind of chalky. But add fat free milk and voila! Instant goodness!In the morning I blend this powder with fresh strawberries and bananas and sometimes add ana vocado. It makes a thick delicious smoothie. Now that the shakes in the cans are back, I'll go back to using them..though am keeping this powder for when I want to add fruit.I have tried the Creamy Chocolate in the cans..thay aren't so bad too.I give it three stars because of the chalky taste..and that I wish it came in a bigger size.
