review/text: My present order was for two pairs to place into my running shoes and my work shoes. Bought a pair of Phase 4 Orthodics in a major pharmacy chain store about 10 years ago and I'm still using the old ones to place inside my golf shoes. I have nothing but praise and complete satisfaction with the way they've worn over the years. Walking, jogging, sprinting with them gives me a solid and stable feel. The reason I bought two more of them was that I just got tired of pulling them out of the shoes from one to the other. Now I don't have to do this with three sets of Phase 4 Orthodics. At the beginning it took a while for me to get used to the raised arches but now I don't wear any shoe without them inside. I didn't give it 5 Stars cause I believe that nothing is a "perfect score," however these orthodic inserts come pretty close.
