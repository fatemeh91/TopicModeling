review/text: I had never seen these before. I had been trained in first aid both in the military and civilian world and had not heard of these. I first read of them while looking up medical supplies, I was curious. After ordering them, I Googled the instructions and have practiced with them. They are easy to use. If you have a serious 1st aid kit, you need these.
