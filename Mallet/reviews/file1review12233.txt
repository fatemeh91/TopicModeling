review/text: I did a lot of research before buying these vitamins, and I can say with confidence that I felt they were the best choice for me and my baby (except maybe New Chapter vitamins, but those are SO crazy expensive and have to be taken so frequently that they really weren't a viable option).I was very concerned about the lead content issue raised in one of the reviews of this product and I followed up with the FDA and my midwife and the Rainbow Light company and I received sufficient evidence to dispell my concerns.I'll admit, the taste can be pretty miserable and the pills are enormous. I gag about 90% of the time I swallow them... but I always get them down eventually. Anyhow, my feeling is, it's a worthwhile sacrifice for my baby's health.
