review/text: This product has never worked right. It makes a lot of noise like it's doing something, but spins and spins and doesn't remove any hair. If you mash it flush against the skin (which is a real blast), it might nick a hair or two. I had one of these previously that worked pretty good. It eventually died & I bought this 'upgraded' model. Another piece of junk product made in China. Buy something else. I really wish companys would stop outsourcing production to China which clearly has zero quality control.
