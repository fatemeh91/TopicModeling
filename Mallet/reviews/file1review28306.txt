review/text: most of these reviews are about the flavor of this product. if im body building i would be more concerned about the content which clearly says each scoop is only about 72-73% protein. 100 percent? pfft! the bulk WPI i have been using is 91% and tastes like the fruit i flavor it with, Im my case frozen blueberries and fresh bananas. my family tries to get in on the smoothies if im not quick because they are delicious! $150 for 10 kg of WPI, i would never waste money on a gimmick such as this when i can buy bulk direct from the source. Mmmm i hope you enjoy the flavors!my recipe1/2 cup frozen blueberries1 whole banana2-3 scoops of WPI1 handful of walnuts or other raw nuts1 cup of skim milkice cubes and a touch of honey if desiredblend until smooth, enjoy and hide from the family
