review/text: I have been dealing with a bad shoulder for years & this allows me to perform trigger point release of the muscles that are hard to reach. I can't believe I waited soo long to break down a purchase this device. Its now something I use on a daily basis for my muscle aches, pains & tightness. Its a great way to get relief when you cant afford accupuncture or a massage!! Inexpensive life saver!!
