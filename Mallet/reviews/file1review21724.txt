review/text: I just got this tub a week ago and me and my 7 month old twin boys LOVE it!! I have been trying for a month to figure out how to bathe my babies together so they can play in the water together. I have a swivel seat and a regular seat but they tip over if the boys get too enthusiastic (they love the bath!). So I was still bathing them one-at-a-time in the basin kitchen sink until I got this tub. They can sit side-by-side or face each other and have a BLAST while I don't have to worry about them hitting their heads if they slip. I have heard mixed reviews about this tub, but for twins who can sit up, it is PERFECT. Plus when they outgrow it, we can put it in the backyard for them to play with in hot weather!
