review/text: This high-quality waterproof pad is made the same way as those that are used in hospitals only it - the Priva pad, is twice the size. I purchased two of these pads for my 86 year old mother who has a bladder control problem and alzheimers. We also have a safety rail on one side of her full-sized bed because she lays entirely on that one side and would fall of were it not there. The other side of her bed is against a wall as is her headboard. She can really, REALLY wet herself through the night if she doesn't wake up to go on her commode. (Or she calls someone to help her.) I position the pad lengthwise down the bed so she lays on the entire pad. It is wonderfull, it greatly protects the sheets and bed from wetness. I would give it more stars if I could!!! It does shift just ever so slightly but not more than an inch and is very comfortable to lay on. (I asked her this when she was in a good frame of mind so I know it to be true.) I give these Super-Plus bed pads from Priva my highest reccomendation and will purchase two more.
