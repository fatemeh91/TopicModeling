review/text: I first found out about Gluten Ease when I encountered it in a natural foods store back in 2006. I immediately bought a bottle to try, and was pleasantly surprised that it works.I have never been diagnosed with celiac disease or gluten intolerance but I am pretty sure that I don't tolerate wheat products well. In my food journals and on elimination diets, I observed that I felt horribly tired after eating pasta, bread and any wheat product. Furthermore, whole wheat products that I thought would be better for me would give me severe indigestion and sharp stabbing pains in my stomach, colon and bowels.I take one Gluten Ease capsule right before consuming a small portion of wheat product (eg one serving of pasta is 1/2 cup). Since the capsule contains enzymes that digest gluten and lactose, it makes sense to take another pill if I eat more servings or if I stretch the meal out over a longer period.I rarely feel the need to eat wheat products nowadays but it's nice to be sociable and eat food at family dinners. Gluten Ease is a great 'antidote' that I can take and it only costs 50 cents per capsule.Highly recommended.
