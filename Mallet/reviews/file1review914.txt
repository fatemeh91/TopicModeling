review/text: My mother who is 90 and suffers from arthritis recently went to the ER with pain in her right arm. When she left there they had given her a bulky brace which made it very difficult to do for herself at home. After the healing process of a couple weeks, I got her these and she was amazed at how she can have the support but with the open fingers still able to do everything she needs to do, even sew ! I would recommend these to anyone needing wrist support. The small size was great too, as most others come in only med. and large.
