review/text: We have 2 potty seats and another child size potty. I actually didn't use the Baby Bjorn for a long time because we had other options. But after finally seeing how easy it is to use, we love it. It's easy to put on our oblong toilets. It fits snuggly, and is easy to clean. My son is 34 pounds now and is way to big for the little chair we bought. The Baby Bjorn fits him fine, there is no need for an extra potty guard and he hasn't complained once about it being uncomfortable. I wouldn't change it a bit.
