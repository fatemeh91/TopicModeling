review/text: I searched high and low for a bottle brush that would fit in my Nalgene Narrow Mouth water bottle, and that wouldn't scratch it up. I purchased this on Amazon and it works great! It easily fits into the Narrow Mouth opening and the flexible neck allows you to clean all areas of the bottle. I don't like to put my Nalgene in the dishwasher, and this makes it so I don't need to. The soft bristles don't scratch the bottle, so my Nalgene continues to look brand new. This is the best bottle brush around!
