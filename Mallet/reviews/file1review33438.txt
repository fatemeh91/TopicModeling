review/text: I thought this was a pack of toothbrushes because of the picture. Probably(?) they say somewhere in the description that there's only 1 toothbrush for the price, but I didn't see it. And yeah, I can definitely say the price is fair, for a nice wooden toothbrush; it's just not what I thought I was buying. The picture is totally misleading.Also, the bristles are SUPER hard! I would use this toothbrush to clean a carburetor, not my teeth. My husband says he likes it, so he's using it now, but I'm kinda worried he's going to ruin his gums on it.
