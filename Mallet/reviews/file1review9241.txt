review/text: I was looking for a slightly larger holder for my pills, and this one works nicely. My only real complaint is that each container dosnt sit very well into the tray. Even if you slightly bump it they have a tendancy to want to fall off the tray. And I especially would not carry this thing from room to room when it was full.
