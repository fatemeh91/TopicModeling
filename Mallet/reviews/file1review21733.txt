review/text: I love this tub!! That said, yesterday the floor seam separated from the walls, but only after 3-4 months of use. Even still, this tub was perfect for my son. He is 30 inches tall and 30 pounds, but he is only 10 mos. old. He is, obviously, too big for a classic infant tub, but it seems like a waste to fill the regular bathtub for a bath that only lasts 10 min. The SnugTub has been a perfect solution. Despite my son's long legs, he fits easily in the tub and has lots of room to splash and even turn around. Despite the tears, I have been very, very pleased with this purchase and will probably buy another.
