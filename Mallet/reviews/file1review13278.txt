review/text: Kiddo is nearly 2 and prone to diaper leaks in the middle of the night and just barely potty training. These are wonderful. We cosleep and one of these under her side of the bed lets me quickly change her area if it happens. It also makes mornings much nicer if it happens even after I change her in the middle of the night. It's a quick change and I don't have to worry about leaks on the tempurpedic! She also has reflux and can be prone on bad days to throwing up. This has held up very well to multiple washings and sanitizings. Which is why I came back for more. We also use these on the spare bed where we change her during the day and it is a great preventative. She tends to sleep hot and this doesn't seem to bother her at all. It's a good size too so I don't have to worry if she rolls closer to me to snuggle that she'll be off the pad. Highly recommended.
