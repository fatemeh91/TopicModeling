review/text: Somehow I ended up with one of those "free" razors as a pull to get you to buy the product. I've seen all the humor on multi blade razors that do seem over the top. Well, surprise! This sucker really works. I mean, it really works. Cleanest shave I ever got. No pull, no nicks, no need to take a second stroke. Expensive, yes, but worth it for me.
