review/text: This product is good and has easy to follow instructions people can really follow. But the product doesn't contain enough strips. There were only eight. So basically the product will be gone after two uses, unlike other Nair products, such as the 15-minute microwaveable warm wax. It has so many strips that one can use it for at least 4 times -- or more. But overall, the product has a good presentation and it's effective.
