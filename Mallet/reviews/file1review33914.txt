review/text: This is advertised as being a "Rapid Release" formula. However, the product I received is NOT "rapid release;" it's just the regular 1mg tablets (useless to me). The information in this product listing (and the product image showing the bottle indicating that it is the "rapid release" formula) SHOULD BE UPDATED NOW, as the 1mg Rapid Release formula has apparently been discontinued by the manufacturer and it seems that Amazon has run out. These REGULAR 1mg Melatonin tablets are available much cheaper elsewhere.
