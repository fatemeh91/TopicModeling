review/text: I think this would fit one sandwich, snack, small drink and small snack, and MAYBE a small ice pack. you might be able to squish one more thing of the list in. For the purpose I wanted it for, it was too small. I was looking for something bigger for Disneyland, but for an afternoon walk, it would be fine. It also looked complicated to install. Didn't try since i knew i was returning it. I'm just going to put a cooler bag in the basket of the stoller.
