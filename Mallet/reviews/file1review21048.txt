review/text: ....I would. Although they are inexpensive, if it wasn't such a problem, I'd ask for my money back.What a piece of garbage. I purchased these for a Formula 1 race. There is no protection with these. Do not waste money. Look for something else, as we had to no ear protection with these and ended up with our fingers in our ears.
