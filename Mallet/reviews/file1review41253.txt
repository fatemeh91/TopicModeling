review/text: I tore a quad tendon in my knee two years ago. Arthritis has developed and there is some sharp pain associated with walking or flexing. I just am not at the point of knee replacement. Also have a Shoulder impingement caused by compression of the tendons of the rotator cuff between a part of the shoulder blade and the head of the humerus. That has some bone spurs which catch at the wrong time and gives a sharp pain.I take 800 mg ibuprofen but do not want to load up the liver with that stuff. Know a person that died from that. So I heard the advertisement, and decided to give Australian Dream Cream a chance.Well, it works, at least for me, plain and simple. I take two finger tips, dip in the jar and rub it in at the source of the ache. It goes away in about 5 minutes, and stays that way for 8 or so hours.
