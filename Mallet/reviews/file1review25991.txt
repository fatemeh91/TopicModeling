review/text: It does block out light very well and doesn't press at all on the eyes, but the mask part has unfinished edges - which can cause scratches - and doesn't fit flush. If you sleep on your back and don't move a lot, this would be a good choice. If you tend to sleep on your side or stomaach, or you have company in bed, this might not be the best choice.It is fairly durable though, and since it doesn't press on the eyes, it's an excellent choice if you wear contacts to bed.
