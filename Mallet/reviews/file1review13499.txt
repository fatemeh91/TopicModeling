review/text: I bought this as a preventive measure in my late pregnancy to protect my expensive Tempur-Pedic king sized mattress. It fits the mattress well. I put my sheets on top of these, and there's no crinkly sound. When this mattress protector first arrived, I tested it by pouring a cup of water on top of it. The water indeed stayed off!
