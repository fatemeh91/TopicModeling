review/text: I started taking this product a few years ago when my whole family was stricken with H1N1. I personally think it helped shorten the length of time we were sick with it. Now my husband and I keep it around just in case. Whenever one of us is feeling something coming, we start taking it. We either end up with a shorter cold or nothing at all. I highly recommend this.
