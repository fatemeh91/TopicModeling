review/text: Trimspa doesn't do much.... but it helps a little bit... I've used it in conjunction w/slimfast (because alone it really didn't do anything).... it helped me get from slimfast to slimfast feeling "hungry" instead of "famished."The good thing is you don't get sick or jittery at all. If you need a little help, this might be the trick. If you are looking for more than that, you can either clean out your diet to the max and kick up your work-outs, or find a more effective product (and post it here so we can all benefit).
