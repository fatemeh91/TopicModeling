review/text: I purchased this for my daughter who is a diabetic. Since her feet get cold alot I thought i would try this and she loves them. You can either take the entire pair and throw them in your microwave or take out the inserts and heat those. We have done both. Very easy to take out inserts they go thru velcro opening at the bottom. I have purchased a few things from this company and I am very pleased and so far hold up very well.
