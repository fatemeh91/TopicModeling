review/text: I don't care what you use it for. This is a bad product. First, the ear piece is very uncomfortable. In fact, it hurts my ear canal. And it doesn't isolate sounds at all. The sound you receive using this is less than what you would get from having your ear next to someone's chest wall.I do have a better quality stethoscope and wanted this one to play a back up stethoscope role when I don't have the other one in handy. But it just isn't usable. It's on par with kids' toy stethoscope. Try using this to do BP and you will miss the beat most of the time, if you can hear it at all.
