review/text: To the folks who put this in water and then drank it, and complained it didn't dissolve... READ THE INSTRUCTIONS.... you have to give it a few minutes to dissolve.Myself, I add this into everything. Its tasteless and textureless, especially compared to the other products on the market. A few years ago I got a bad cholesteral report and the doctor suggested upping my fiber by adding this sort of product (since I don't like veggies) as one part of combating the problem. I tried the stuff in the orange container and HATED it, it turned everything to jello.Then this product came out, and I tried it and was very happy with the results. But like I said, you need to give it a minute or two to dissolve. DO NOT put it in fizzy drinks unless your trying to get rid of the fiz.For those who do Weight Watchers, adding this will lower the points value of food/drink if it has no fiber grams in it to start with. (I asked the group leader and she confirmed this.)Also, I don't exercise (me bad), and I'm not great about watching my diet (deep fried mac and cheese makes me happy), but overall my cholesteral levels have gone down a few points by liberally including this stuff in my morning coffee with flavored creamer, and mixing it into my mac and cheese, etc.That and my bowels move better and easier.
