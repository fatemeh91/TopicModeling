review/text: My husband bought this for his cracked, dry feet. I started using it last summer when I wore a lot of sandles and the bottoms of my feet started to look and feel dry. I love it! The first few days I used it, I lathered it on thick & put on a pair of socks & went to bed. The first morning I noticed a difference and after 3 nights - wow! No more dry feet! It works well for my husband too! Now I just spot use it, whenever the heels or balls of my feet start to feel dry. It is a bit thin-the reason for the 4 instead of 5 stars, but still works great!1smileycat :-)
