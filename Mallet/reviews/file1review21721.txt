review/text: We bought this tub for our 8 month old who sits unassisted very well. The snug tub is good because its inflatable for travel and storage. It is soft for when she plays and leans on the sides and I know she won't get hurt. But... the bottom of the tub is VERY slippery! If I try to stand her to wash her she slips on the bottom. When she plays she gets off balance sometimes and starts to slip so I need to be right next to her to catch before she goes under. The other big downfall I have found is the drain. It is very hard to push it in so you get a complete suction so the water wont drain out. I do like the idea behind the snug tub but I think it could be improved.
