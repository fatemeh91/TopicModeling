review/text: I read the positive reviews about this product and I've come to the conclusion that I must have SUPER BUGS! I have a large nest of yellow jackets, (you know, the kind that likes to crawl into your soda pop can or make your life miserable at the zoo). They built their nest under one of my eaves about 13' above the ground. I bought a can of this stuff and waited till dusk. First of all it fell far short of the 22' they claim. I was lucky to get 10'! I had to get a ladder to get within 10' of the nest and then I soaked it, just like the instructions said I should. This is the next day now and they're up there buzzing around like nothing happened, in fact I think they like the stuff! Was the formula changed since all these positive reviews were left? The ingredients on my can says: Prallethrin....0.02%, Cypermethrin....0.05%, other ingredients....99.93%, contains petroleum distillates. This tells me that a mere 0.07% (that's seven one hundredths of one percent!)of the entire contents of the can is supposed to do all the work and 99.93% is nothing but inert stuff that's used as nothing but a vehicle and something to fill the can with and that all! I'm no chemist, but I sure remember a lot more stuff in these types of sprays than that! I remember pyrethrins as being one of the major ingredients. Not anymore! Maybe somebody got sued by a cheap lawyer so they had to "safetyize" the stuff to the point that it doesn't work anymore! More and more products are becoming non-functional because of frivolous lawsuits.
