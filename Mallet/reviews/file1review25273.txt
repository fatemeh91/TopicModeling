review/text: Hello- I recently ordered two sennheiser 151 batteries. I have used for about 10 years, and only new every 4-5 years. Not always from Amazon. However, the last order I received one 151, and the other looked almost the same, but when I went o put into headphone it did not fit. The one I received needed the label removed before it fit, but the other would not go into the charger or the headphone, and on extra close inspection, they are not the same. the one is about .1mm thicker, and the contacts are a different size, and there is no 151 identifing marking on one side opposite the contact side. So when you sent the two new one's I ordered today, please make sure they are the proper 151 sennheiser rechargeable NIMH batter as shown in the picture.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009PL4CY/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_imghttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009PL4CY/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_imordered under ag miller 4402 sw rose st.
