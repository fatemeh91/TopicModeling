review/text: I love this knee brace. I had a patella dislocation and it is perfect for my injury. I actually had this brace prescribed and was getting it at my local medical supplies store but found it cheaper on here. If you have a serious problem with your knee, you really need to get a fitting and get a brace that is designed FOR your injury. This brace is designed to keep your patella in place and make you feel like you have more support. (My joints have play so i need the pressure.) It is an awesome brace if you use it for the injuries it is intended to be used for. If you're not sure which brace you need, you should really see a doctor and have them tell you what would be good for you.
