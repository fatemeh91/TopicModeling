review/text: OK so the handle does come apart sometimes. Big deal. For twenty bucks this thing is great. Actually works better than some vacuum cleaners that I've had. If the handle comes apart, just put it back together or tape it if you are that upset about it. For $20 it can't be beat.Solid constuction. Worth twice the price. Don't listen to those others.
