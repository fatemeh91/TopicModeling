review/text: My fitness instructor recommended Magnesium Citrate instead of Magnesium Oxide due to the body's poor absorption of the latter. Unfortunately, Magnesium Oxide is cheap and plentiful and Magnesium Citrate difficult to find in the city where I live. I found this brand of Magnesium Citrate on amazon.com. I'm not sure why I chose this brand; most likely it had good reviews from other amazon.com shoppers. Too, it may have rung a bell as a brand previously recommended to me. I ordered two bottles, they arrived quickly and I started taking the Magnesium Citrate, 400 mg/day. Works as promised (not by the vendor; by various health professionals not connected with the vendor).
