review/text: I am so glad I came across these Vitamins! The only downside to them is the high price. If the jar were larger id have no problem paying that much.I highly recommend whole food vitamins and I like that these contain chaste berry and some other herbs for womans health. I can take these on an empty stomach and its just fine.
