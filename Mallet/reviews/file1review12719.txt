review/text: These batteries discharge at a measured rate of 100mA/day or more. Even fully charged with a good charger they won't even turn on any of my digital cameras. The stated capacity is totally fake. I can assure this after having tested three different models, all AAs: 2500, 2700 and 2900MAh declared capacity.Avoid them!
