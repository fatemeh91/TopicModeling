review/text: I have read both the positive and not so positive comments here regarding 'Shinglederm' and I can honestly say that I am just a regular consumer and have nothing to gain whatsoever by giving this product the glowing review that it so well deserves. Not every product has the same results for every person, but when you are suffering the horrible itching, burning and pain of shingles, this product, that was designed specifically for that purpose, is well worth the try!I stumbled across the name 'Shinglederm' while searching the internet for something that might give me some relief. Up to that point I had only found recommendations for cortisone cream and lavender. Oatmeal soaps are recommended too.....but I needed MORE! MORE is exactly what I found when I located this product and I was delighted to learn that it was carried by Amazon.I don't go out of my way to recommend products as a rule unless I feel that they are outstanding, such as 'Shinglederm' is. My only regret is that it wasn't invented years earlier when other family members could have taken advantage of it as I am doing right now.
