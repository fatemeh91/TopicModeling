review/text: I've used this for 15 years or more, and wondered if it had changed with the new packaging, but after using the new package, it seems to be the same quality. Good stuff, and even in Florida heat in the summertime, it will last weeks with a single application. (at least for me, and I sweat a lot!) It's not an antiperspirant, so it doesn't clog your pores, but simply prevents bacteria from forming and creating the smell associated with underarms.
