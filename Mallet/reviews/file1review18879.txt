review/text: Purchased this item for a Serta contour changing pad and it wasn't until it was on the changing pad that I realized it didn't fit correctly because it wasn't made for a contoured changing pad. I guess I didn't fully read the description so the ill fit wasn't that big of a deal. However, the material seems kind of cheap and the terry tends to pick if you catch velcro - from a diaper tab or swaddle blanket - on it. Overall I like the Carter's and Babies R Us brand changing pad covers much better - the better quality is worth the few extra dollars. I would not purchase this item again, even if it did fit the Serta changing pad.
