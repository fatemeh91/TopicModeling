review/text: This foot bath by Brookstone is simply wonderful overall. However, because the summer has been so hot, I have not felt like using it much. That is okay with me because I do not stand on my feet all day during this time. Once I am back teaching, I am positive that it will be used often. The heating element works well; in fact, I have to turn it down or off when it gets a little too warm. I would rather have that problem than the reverse, though. The jets are nice for the toes and balls of the feet, but be sure to rotate them downward or else you may spray out onto the floor. The foot bath is almost too large for me and will fit even a men's size 13, I believe, so it is cumbersome to carry back to the shower for draining purposes. The "massaging" rollers on the bottom are okay but they don't really do much for my category of aches. I will try and report back in a few months regarding how long the heater retains its function.
