review/text: I see a lot of you complaining about being jittery and hyper and STILL JUST SITTING ON YOUR ASS! These are pills to assist in your diet and exercise. It's not magic! You take it 15 minutes before eating and then you go work out! If you don't eat, yes you will feel like you're going to puke your guts out. It's caffine, not capsulated lipo. You have to get up and do something, you can't just sit there and expect it to eat away at your fat. I haven't experienced the uncontrollable shits you people speak of, but I have experienced the dizziness and not being able to sleep. I've also felt the moodiness and depression. That's why I only give this thing 3 stars. It makes me feel like I'm on bad antidepressants. I took two last night before I went to the gym and DIDN'T eat.. bad idea. Felt like I left my stomach at the gym. I would definitely recommend drinking a whole lot of water like it says. This is for sure not for everyone. Maybe if you have totally horrible side effects that are super affecting your life you should more than likely STOP taking them! DUH! (: Hope this helped someone!
