review/text: I used this pillow on a flight to and from Australia and it saved me from having a stiff neck and I got lots of sleep. It's true, it's a bit bulky and less convenient than the inflatable pillows, but it's a lot softer and smells nice (it has aroma beads in a little pocket). I really liked it and found it to be firmer than some of the cheap pillows they sell at the airports.
