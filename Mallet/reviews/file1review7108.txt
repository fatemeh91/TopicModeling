review/text: Although I don't always shave with an electric shaver, I need one for those times when I'm in a hurry. This one fits the bill. It gives a quick, close shave. I would recommend this razor for two maIn reasons. One, it works very well. Two, it is made in the USA. The only reason I haven't given it five stars is that I haven't had it long enough to test its durability.
