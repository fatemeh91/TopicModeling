review/text: This item just shipped today, and I couldn't wait to try it. Totally uncomfortable! Very revealing under clothes. The left arm strap was actually constructed twisted which made the left side even more uncomfortable than the right. The straps roll into a cord regardless of an undershirt or near the skin, and the the section that attaches the hooks to the actual straps isn't as wide as the photo shown. I feel if I had received that one I might be happier with the product. I did give it one star because it did pull my shoulders back and improved my posture. Totally not worth the pain.
