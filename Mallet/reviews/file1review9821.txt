review/text: These are great for splinters and ingrown hairs. However, my fiancee (who I bought them for) has trouble getting a hold of the hairs because the point is so fine. I dont have any trouble with them though. Thats why I gave them a 4 star instead of 5 because they may be difficult to use for some.
