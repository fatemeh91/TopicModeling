review/text: I've had one UK made clipper for almost 20 years. I replaced it every once in a while with solid, European-made substitutes, but somehow the old clipper would always outlive the new products. It's only with the new Wahl clipper that I can safely put my old one to rest, because after a few haircuts I can tell it's an excellent product that functions impeccably. One small concern I have is the plastic handle on the side for adjustment of the actual metal clippers on top, as this seems somewhat fragile, but otherwise, the shave is very close cut, very clean (no hairs left behind) and the kit has more pieces than I'll ever need. I'm sure you'll enjoy the product yourself.
