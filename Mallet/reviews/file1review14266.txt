review/text: Our problem has little to do with mildew but we have a significant issue with 'soap scum' due to the effects of hard water combined with body oils and bar soap waxes and because our shower doors are transparent they show all residual matter. As a test, we tried using the liquid from the refill bottle just to see if it had the ability to work with manual application and it didn't appear to work any better than the rest of the many products we've tried. Whether or not it does, however, the spray from the dispenser does not reach the back wall higher then 6 inches above the floor and the overlap where the 2 doors meet (1/2 inch) prevents spray from reaching the second door. Even though the idea seems a good one, I can award only one star to this product because it apparently cannot deliver the results that it promises.
