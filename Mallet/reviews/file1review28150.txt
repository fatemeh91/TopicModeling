review/text: After trying EAS protein powder, I thought I would just pass by protein powder and go "all natural". That stuff was nasty. This product was later recommended by a friend so I thought I would try it. Needless to say, this stuff is pretty good. When used with milk, the milk chocolate really does taste like a milkshake. The aftertaste is minimal, unlike the other brands I have tried. Hard to beat. This stuff cuts down my recovery time by about 1/2 after a heavy work out vs not using it.
