review/text: I thought this diaper pail was going to be the answer to our diaper disposal issues. We had previously tried a popular diaper pail that did nothing to stop odors. This one does the trick with keeping the room smelling not like a diaper, but lacks in the design area.First of all, it should have been designed to be at least twice as big. We use size 4 diapers, and this pail barely holds two days worth of diapers. If I wanted to change the pail that often, I would use a regular garbage pail.Secondly, when it's full or the batteries die, the pail is useless. Therefore, you're left standing there holding a steaming diaper!And finally, the materials used seem flimsy for the amount of use the pail receives.I'm hoping for an improved version soon!
