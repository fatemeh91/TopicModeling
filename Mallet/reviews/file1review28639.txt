review/text: I have ordered Gold Standard Whey in the past & have never been disappointed. I use it for breakfast after an early morning workout. Taste is great & it mixes well with water. If you are adding fruit, I always order the vanilla & create my own protein smoothies. I will continue to order this product, I have found it to be one of the highest sources of Whey Protein Isolate. I love the tast & the results. Thanks for the great products.Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard Natural Whey, Natural Vanilla, 2 Pound
