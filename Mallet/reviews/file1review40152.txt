review/text: This was a good kit for me, as I'm new to yoga. The mat gets slippery easily, so I usually just put a towel over the mat, so I don't slip while doing the different poses. The blocks and belt are standard, no complaints there. It would have been nice if the kit came with a bolster or cushion mat also. The bag for the yoga mat looks very cheap and is pretty useless. Overall, I think this is a great price for what's included!
