review/text: My favorite is not carried by Amazon or sold in Brookstone anymore: the "authentic" tempurpedic eye mask. The one that Brookstone sells nowNapForm Eye Maskis really not worth the money at all. A poor substitute for the tempurpedic, which is available on the tempurpedic website.That said, this Bucky's Ultralight mask is pretty good and not so expensive. It covers the eyes and seals the area around the nose for a 99.9 to 100.0 % blockout, depending on the position. It does not press the eyes down, which others have said interferes with REM sleep. I really like this mask. It is light and does not disturb my sleep. Some of the bulkier masks actually woke me up when I turned over.No problems for side sleepers, which can't be said for most of these masks. ThisDream Essentials Sweet Dreams Contoured Sleep Mask with Earplugs and Travel Pouch ~ Blackis not so bad, but this Bucky's Light is better.You can see from photos that a user posted that it is not a lifetime mask like the tempurpedic, BUT it is washable, which the tempurpedic is not, and depending on the color you get, not very expensive. Given the price of blackout shades, I can buy a truckload of these and still be ahead. :)I was not impressed with the packaging from BigFly sports: just an envelope and the mask was mashed, but bounced back okay.I am amazed at the difference a good eye mask can make to getting more and better sleep. Good luck!
