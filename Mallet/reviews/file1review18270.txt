review/text: I bought this stuff thinking it would be better or "more slippery" than the KY SILK lube, but its not even close. Its more tacky or stickier in its feel. If your buying this for use with toys, you will be sorely disappointed. Its also very hard to wash off and leaves a film on your skin. I don't know what the makers were thinking when they made this stuff, but it's not anywhere close to being worth the money. If you want the best lube, in my oppinion its KY SILK. Its super slippery, feels great and washes up with ease.
