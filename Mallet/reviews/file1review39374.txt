review/text: It did nothing for my posture. The material is stretchy so it gives too much and does not help hold my shoulders back. It also has nothing to go around in front under the chest so it just keeps sliding up and forward and the next thing you know the back of it is up on the back of your neck and your shoulders are slumped forward again. Hate to say it, but it didn't work at all for me.
