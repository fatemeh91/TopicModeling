review/text: When I was growing up we were taught, that to clean your teeth you needed a firm bristle toothbrush. Other toothbrushes were available though. Now we are being told that you should use a soft bristle brush. Have you ever used a soft bristle toothbrush, and then used a hard bristle one back to back? You would immediately notice that the hard bristle brush cleans much better. Now why would the American Dental Association change their message and start telling people to use a soft bristle toothbrush that doesn't clean your teeth as well? Maybe because they want you to spend more money on your dental visits. So that dentists might be able to make more money on your decaying teeth. Why are firm bristle toothbrushes so hard to find now? Why are my choices being limited now, as to what is available for me to use? I have never had a problem with using a firm bristle toothbrush, and I think the stories they cite of people who rub off their own enamel are of people who have obsessive compulsive disorder and brush their teeth too much. If you wash your hands too much they will start to bleed as well, but I don't think you should then out law wash clothes.This toothbrush is a classic firm bristle toothbrush that really works, and I have used this particular type for several years now, but it is getting harder and harder to find. I suggest that you buy several if you buy any because I fear that soon they will no longer be available anywhere. Maybe even you noticed just how hard it was to find a firm bristle toothbrush. A firm bristle toothbrush is where its at.
