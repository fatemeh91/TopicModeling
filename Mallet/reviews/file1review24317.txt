review/text: I ordered the insoles to fit my work boots. The heel support was good. The problem that I have with the soles is that they are not long enough for my feet. They do not ride properly centered onto the crest of my arch. This caused improper support and pain throughout my feet. I have size 13 wide feet and ordered the largest size avaialble.
