review/text: I bought two of these for my kids at christmas thinking they could put it in their beds to keep warm. The first one arrived with a hole in it and I've tried contacting them and have never received a response from them. Secondly, we put the other one in the microwave for the two minutes on ea. side and It smelled like it was burning. The first time I actually threw it outside because I thought it was going to catch on fire! It made our microwave smell like burnt popcorn and My kids hate the smell of it. This product stinks - LITERALLY!
