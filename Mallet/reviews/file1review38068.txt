review/text: I take these bars with me when I go on bike rides. Generally in about 1 1/2 hours into the ride I run out of energy. I eat one of these bars. (or two) It boosts my energy and the chocolate/chocolate aspect of it improves my mood. :o) It holds me over for about another 1 to 1 1/2 hour.What's good about this bar: (aside from the chocolate/chocolate aspect)- Unlike some protein bars, it doesn't smell funny or chemically- It doesn't taste funky or chemically either- Unlike other protein bars, you won't break your teeth trying to bite into it. It's actually very soft. You can easily pull it apart with your fingers.- Unlike candy bars, it doesn't melt, fall apart or turn into goo, if you carry it around for an hour or two.- Easily digestible, not heavy. Yet filling.- Did I mention chocolate/chocolate crisp? As other reviewers described, it's like chocolate rice crispies and chocolate chips sitting on top of a soft brownie......It's goooood!I can't stand most protein bars, but this bar has saved my life on more than one occasion.
