review/text: The Body Back Buddy is perfect for me. The different knobs provide some great relief to my trigger points especially in my lumbar and shoulder areas. It is a little big to fit in a traveling bag but thats not really a big issue. I def like it better than a deep tissue massage b/c I can control the pressure myself.
