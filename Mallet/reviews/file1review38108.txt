review/text: i use crest tooth paste because, well i dont know but this toothpaste makes your breath a little freasher. it comes in different flavors and has different abilities like whitens teeth or prevents cavities. i brush my teeth twice each day and this is my paste of choice. but i do have one question... why am i reviewing toothpaste?
