review/text: The entire Speick line is awesome. But let's face it. When you're shaving, it all starts with the soap or the cream. And they're both fantastic. But this is a review for the soap. The Speick Shaving Stick offers a lather that is slick and cushioning. It's extremely easy to lather, and smells absolutely fantastic. It has a distinct herbal scent that is very masculine. I would describe it as woodsy and spicy with just the very lightest hint of citrus. Whether you use the stick as intended, or grate it up into more traditional puck, you will not be disappointed by the performance of this product.
