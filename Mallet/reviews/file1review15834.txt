review/text: I heard about this product from a co-worker. We work in a very physically demanding job, on our feet, walking hard most days. He mentioned that he was taking Tripple Flex and that it helped him emensely. He went off of it for a couple weeks and all of the aches and pains were back.I started taking this product about 3 weeks ago. Daily, I would hurt in both hips and knees. I felt that I would not be able to continue my job much longer if I did not find some fource of relief. Once I started taking it, about 3 days later, I went all day without feeling the aches and pains.This is a great product and I will not go without it!Nature Made Triple Flex, Glucosamine 1500 mg, Chondroitin 290 mg, Hyaluronic Acid 10 mg, 120 Caplets
