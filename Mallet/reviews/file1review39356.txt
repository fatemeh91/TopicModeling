review/text: I found this product to be a great help in reminding me to keep my shoulders back. It's a little difficult to get off, but it wouldn't be doing you any good if it wasn't tight enough. You definitely need to wear it over a tee shirt, as it would leave your armpits raw otherwise. I have some neck problems, and found I could only wear it for a couple of hours without it putting too much strain on my neck. But that's been enough. Doing that has helped me to remember to keep my shoulders back throughout the day. For the price, it's a great product.
