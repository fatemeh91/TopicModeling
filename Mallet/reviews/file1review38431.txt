review/text: I received my epilator approx. two weeks ago. I wish I would have known about this years ago as a teen. I would have prevented cuts and several scars from shaving, not metion having to shave everyday to keep smooth (hair free) legs, bikini and underarms. I agree with most reviews, it does hurt at first. I was able to tolerate it. No worse than waxing, at least you know it comes off the first time, unlike waxing that sometimes sticks and does not come off-ouch. Advice: let your hair grow out a bit to make sure you get all of it, it pulls it from the root. I removed the bikini area, legs and underarms. It's been a 7 days and I have not had to use the epilator since. The legs is a bit different. I have had to use it every other day on the ones that grow unevenly. Absolutely worth every penny! The hair that is growing back is smoother and finer. I really like it.
