review/text: THIS is what protein was meant to be. I was using a Sams Club 5 lb bag of chocolate protein for a while, and let me say, this stuff is a million times better. The Sams Club protein mixed "syrupey" and thick, whereas ON Gold Standard mixed SMOOTH and "loose," like a good protein shake should be. It even mixes easier. The taste is phenomenal, just a great quality protein overall.I still have yet to see it's after-workout effects, but I believe it's gonna be good news.I would definitely recommend this protein to a friend, and this is the only protein I'll be buying from now on! Very happy I decided to try ON.
