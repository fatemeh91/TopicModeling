review/text: I bought this product about a month ago and have really liked it so far. I really feel that my mouth feels cleaner after I brush with this toothbrush. It has also helped me brush longer and more thuroughly. It gives you a warning every 30 seconds, telling you when to switch sides of your mouth. While I don't always use this, it has helped me to brush for a full two minutes.Each charge last for a long time as well. I actually can't remember the last time I charged my toothbrush. I would say once every couple weeks, and I brush multiple times a day.The only con I have noticed is that the tooth brush head is alittle small, but the vibration and cleaning power of the toothbrush makes this less noticeable.I would recommend this toothbrush to anyone looking for a better toothbrush that wants a cleaner mouth and whiter teeth.
