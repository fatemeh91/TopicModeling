review/text: In March 2006 had emergency eye surgery and ended up with a scleral bucklesutured to L eye. One year later started having really dry eyes, eye pain in the morning and blurred vision first few hours of each day. Seems I have nocturnal lagophthalmos (medical term for incomplete eyelid closure during sleep). Basically I was drying out my corneas each night. After trying 5 different eye drops (including Genteal drops) I bought the Genteal eye gel for severe dry eye. The gel along with Omega 3 capsules and Tranquileyes moisture goggles at night have finally given some relief. I would highly recommend this to anyone suffering with dry eyes. The gel is a little harder to get into your eyes but the relief is worth it. I suggest you store the gel with the tip of tube facing down so it comes out easier. Be sure not to touch the tip of tube with your eyes or fingers to maintain sterility. Wash hands before applying and know your vision will be blurred for a few minutes after application as gel is thicker than drops. See an eye doctor too to check out your eyes if dryness persists more than 3 days.
