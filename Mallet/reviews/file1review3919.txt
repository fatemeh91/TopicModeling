review/text: First, I have no complaints on the performance of the Crest Whitestrips. This product works wonders and, as advertised, is safe on the tooth enamel when used as directed. My dissatisfaction with this product is the packaging chosen on the "Premium" product. In the past I was a Crest Whitestrips Classic customer until I decided to try the Premium version. The Classic product came in simple cardstock packaging with cellophane wrap as the protective tamperproof seal. The Premium product is in a sturdy #5 plastic box which, unless you have a recycling center that accepts this type of plastic, will go into your local landfill. This packaging is absolutely a waste and surely drives up the price of the product. Please recycle.
