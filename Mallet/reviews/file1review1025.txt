review/text: We bought this watch for my 6 yr old daughter and are very happy with it. She wears it everyday and reallylikes it also. The voice speaks clearly and loudly enough to be heard easily. It's easy to set the time and alarm.It's sturdy enough for play and my doughter like to show her friends how it works. Nice product.
