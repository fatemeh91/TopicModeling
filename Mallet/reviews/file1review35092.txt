review/text: My new dog (a puppy-mill breeder) has fairly severe separation anxiety. She has "redecorated" during my absences. This was recommended by the rescue organization I adopted her from. Two sprays about 30 minutes before I leave and she settles down, stops her destructive behaviors and crying. With behavioral training, this has worked wonders. I recommend it highly. By the way, this is the exact same formula as the "dog product" and you get twice as much for a couple of dollars less.
