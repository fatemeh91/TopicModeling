review/text: I have found theraputty to be a great reinforcing activity for preschool and elementary age children and it also strengthens their fine motor skills at the same time. Everyone gets excited when it is "putty time"! I like to hide tiny beans or other small objects inside that they have to dig out with their fingers. They love it!
