review/text: I agree with every single thing that 'prettynpink' wrote, and when i read that review it sounded like I wrote it! This is SO much better than my venus razor! It is comfortable, and no nicks or cuts! I can shave really fast, it only takes a second. Plus, If you miss a spot, you can easily just go back over again. I originally bought this for a summer vacation in about a week or two, but I wanted to use it first to make sure i liked it, and I love it! I'm not saving this for my vacation, I'm gonna use it from now on. It's great for travel, cause you just bring one unit, not the razor and the shave gel, which is unbeleivably bulky! Another thing is that my legs don't feel as prickley the next day.
