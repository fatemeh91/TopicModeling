review/text: I love the brace, but it wasn't right for me. I am extremely athletic and muscular, so when the instructions were to measure the knee around the kneecap, I did. My problem is that my thigh and calf are larger than "normal" and I couldn't get the brace over my calf! I think it would be helpful to specify the calf, knee, AND thigh measurements where the brace will need to fit so users will know for sure they've got a proper fit. Otherwise, I hear it's a great brace!!! I ended up going with the "one size fits most."
