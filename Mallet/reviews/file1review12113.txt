review/text: I normally can't take pills because they make me nauseous, so when I read that not only is this a one a day vitamin but it's also great for people with sensitive stomachs I decided to give it a try. I'm so happy that I did, these are great. I also checked the label against other one a day vitamins for women and this one had much more content, so I think spending a little more money on it is well worth it.
