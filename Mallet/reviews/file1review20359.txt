review/text: I wear glasses when I work at the computer and always get smudges at the bottom of the glasses, as I must be touching them without even knowing it. I notice the annoying smudges because it becomes more difficult to see, so I always have a cleaning cloth next to the computer.This microfiber cloth does a much better job than tissues or terrycloth towels I used before. Once a week or so I wash the glasses with water and dry them with this cloth (they surprisingly absorbent). Otherwise I just wipe the hand oils from my glasses several times a day. These cloths do a nice job cleaning the glasses.If I drop the glasses or get dirt on them other than smudges from my hands I take care to remove grit by washing the glasses to remove the grit to avoid scratching the glasses by pushing it across the glass with the cloth.The cloth is large enough (6 3/4" x 6 3/4") to comfortably put it on both sides of the glasses lens for cleaning. The cloth can be washed. The package includes a pouch. I usually do not use it at the computer, but if I go somewhere where I would need to use my glasses it makes it convenient to put the cloth in my purse.There was only one thing I did not like about this cloth: it comes with a small pouch that does not have flap. Keeping the cloth clean is very important to avoid getting the dirt on it which will scratch the surfaces of the glasses, so I was surprised that it came with such poor pouch. I swapped it with a pouch that came with a polishing cloth for silver that does not get as much use.I am attaching a photo to customer photos which shows the cloth next my reading glasses for size reference.Overall, this cloth does a good job at a decent price.Ali Julia review
