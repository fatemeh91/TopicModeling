review/text: Liquid Silk is good, but not as good as Astroglide, which continues to be the best out there. Liquid Silk is good for sex, although you have to add more as you go (it tends to dry out, not totally, but enough to want to add more). We tend to use a lot, so the bottle size is insufficient, maybe lasts 5 sessions. Still, better than nothing (spit dries up too!).
