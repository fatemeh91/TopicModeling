review/text: I've purchased this product twice in less than 1 year. While it's very helpful when inflated, after a month or so it won't stay inflated for more than 30 minutes of use. I figured maybe the first one was just a dud, so I purchased another one. I still have the same problem - I use it in my car driving to and from work (a 45-minute drive)...I blow it up every morning and by the time I get to work, it's flat. I blow it up in the afternoon for the drive home, and again, it's deflated by the time I get home. I've had the same problem with both of the supports I've purchased. No only is it inexpensive, it's cheap and not worth the air it takes to inflate it twice a day!
