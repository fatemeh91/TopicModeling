review/text: Same sharpness and function as the regular Tweezerman in a smaller size. Not at all harder to hold or use.Much more convenient in my opinion. I use these as my everyday tweezers. Gets all the fine hairs..very sharp.What else to say? If you have trouble pulling hair or are always pulling the same spots over and over, get these. Gets most hairs on the first pull.Also, the price is right here on amazon. Around 30% less as these sell for around fifteen bux in the drug store.
