review/text: I just received the Cookies and Cream flavor for this product, and it was okay. I was expecting an Oreo type cookies and cream flavor, but this tastes like that fake cookie dough flavor. It is similar to the taste of a cookies and cream Powerbar, except this has too strong of that artificial cookie dough flavor, which is not a good thing. The smell is not what you'd expect for the flavor, it is quite overpowering with the artificial flavor with a hint of coffee as some other reviewers mentioned.I got this flavor because I wanted to try something different, and it won in a coin toss against chocolate. It is drinkable, but I would not recommend this flavor. It tastes a little better in milk, but I usually take my shakes with water. I would give it a 6/10.The price is right and the quality is there. I will be sticking with ON, but want to try Double Chocolate or Vanilla Chai next.tl;drCookies and Cream flavor okay. 6/10. Would not recommend this flavor.
