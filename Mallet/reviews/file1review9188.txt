review/text: I have had a smaller product in the same style, and it was frustrating and time consuming to fill them because to fit my perscription drugs and nutritional supplements into the small spaces required they each be placed in a particular order. I had just told a friend i needed the same style in a larger size when i found these in a web search. They are large enough to fit my fish oil capsules, vitamins, and other supplements without forcing them. Last night i did 6 weeks worth of medications in 2/3 the time it used to take me.So far the section covers are sturdy, but i have only used the chests for a few weeks. The covers open on the opposite side of the smaller one, so i am having to relearn opening them, and the edge for lifting the covers would be easier on my arthritic hands if it were a little wider. I purchased two chests from Amazon and found the same product labeled for my HMO in the HMO pharmacy for 1/2 the price, so i bought four more.
