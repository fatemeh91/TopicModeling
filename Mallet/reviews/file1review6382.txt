review/text: I have had back and neck issues for many years. A friend recommended getting a 'Thera-cane'. I bought the Body Back Buddy and have not been disappointed.It has rounded and pointed ends on either side for more options. There are several ends to reach painful areas-neck, back, shoulder. Just press and release- much relief from nagging pain. It works easily lying down, standing up or with a partner.The price is right too!
