review/text: A very powerful clipper that will cut my thick hair in one quick stroke. To my pleasant surprise it also came with blades and other accessories even though that wasn't included in the product description.The tapering lever has a wide range, probably a quarter inch.My only complaint is that they are extremely loud. When I adjust the power down to reduce the volume it's not strong enough to cut. I have to wear earplugs when I use them and the noise annoys my wife, but other than that it is an awesome product. I am fairly confident that this problem can be resolved through tinkering with the screws.Include blades, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, left taper, right taper. Also came with oil, brush, and blade guard.
