review/text: I have been using it for few months now and I even trimmed my hair with it once. It is excellent for beard since it has adjustable spacing.. from 1 - 9. You can even remove the plastic spacer and use the trimmer for precise edges. Highly recommend it, especially at price Amazon has it.
