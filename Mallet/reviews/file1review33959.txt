review/text: This Therapy massage bar is made with neroli and lavender making it very relaxing. I also has shea butter which makes it perfect for massage. It can be a bit oily to start with but normally absorbs into the skin by the time the massage is over. Personally I enjoy giving massages more when I use this LUSH massage bar. It just seems more fun.~The Rebecca Review
