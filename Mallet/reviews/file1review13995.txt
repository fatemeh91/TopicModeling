review/text: So, these are for those who are crafty and can improvise. If that's not you, don't bother.Tips for Good Fit1) There are 3 trays for a reason. Use the first one to test out your methods so your last 2 can be perfect.2) Err on the short side for dipping duration. If it's wilting, probably already too late. I used a larger set of water so I dipped for about 5 seconds.3) Be sure to suck air out so it presses against your teeth.4) I repeated this process 3-4 times per tray.
