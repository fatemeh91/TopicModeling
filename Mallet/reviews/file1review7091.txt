review/text: The Wahl shaver works wonderfully. I've had mine since mid-January. The battery life is pretty good-used it for 2 1/2 weeks before charging(every other day NOT everyday). Its a close shave and the attached trimmer is really sharp and works great for getting those pesky odd hairs and for trimming the mustache.There are a few drawbacks:The attached trimmer is more difficult than it should be to open.This shaver is LOUD. Its louder than the clippers I use to cut my hair!The charging base is rather shoddy and comes apart easily.Besides that its a great shaver and I highly recommend it.I have no comment on the personal trimmer as I have yet to use it.
