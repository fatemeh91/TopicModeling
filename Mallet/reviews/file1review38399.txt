review/text: UPDATE 09/2010My epilator stopped working and I decided to buy a different brand. However, it has worked really good for all of this time.It is really great!!! Sure, it does hurt, but not any more than waxing. I do not shave because I get cut very easily. This is a great alternative to expensive waxing. Even when I have more hair it works. I would buy this product again, and again.
