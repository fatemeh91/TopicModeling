review/text: I recently bought one of these for my karate class and it works well. I am a large man 6'2" 355lb and it fits well. It is a little snug when I first put it on but as it warms up it fits better. The only problem I have is the spring rods on the outside of the leg digs into my calf. This I think will be less noticeable in time kind of like a new shoe hitting you in a diff different spot in the heal. But over all top notch brace.
