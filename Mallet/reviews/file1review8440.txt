review/text: Now that is an AWESOME bottle brush. If only they used pink instead of blue, then I would swear to forsake all others and never ever use any other bottle brush in my life ever again. I use it for my stainless steel water bottle, the tall Nissan thermos (which is also wonderful!) and for my reusable carbonated water bottles. I almost gave up an all that and was going to take the route of plastic, disposable bottles because washing them was such an annoying chore. Not anymore! This brush gets the job done in no time at al, and the grip is wonderful, and it's very thorough. I can't believe it's so inexpensive!
