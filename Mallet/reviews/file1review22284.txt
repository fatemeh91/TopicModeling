review/text: I loved this product when I was nursing and can't recommend it enough for soreness for the new mom. What I discovered is that it's great for other uses. During cold season, I blow my nose so much the skin cracks and it HURTS! I have tried everything on it and nothing works to actually heal it except Purelan! Yes, it's kind of sticky, but give it a try. I put it on all day, it made my nose feel better and overnight the pain was gone.I even used it on my knuckles (which crack and bleed during the winter) and it healed them in two days. I can't say enough good things about this product. Buy it. ...
