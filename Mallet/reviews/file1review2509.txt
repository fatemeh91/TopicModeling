review/text: I have used Epilady products for 18 years, but have always winced at the expense of the products (in all fairness, my first Epilady, which cost over $100, lasted 10 years). The Norelco product works just as well and was less than half the cost of the equivalent Epilady. I'm glad to see there's some competition in this marketplace!
