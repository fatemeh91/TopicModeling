review/text: I'm pretty picky when it comes to what I like to use to get my dishes clean in the dishwasher. I've been through my fair share and have yet to come across one as great as the Finish Powerball Tablets. These tablets have done a wonderful job to getting my dishes sparkling clean without leaving spots or any undesired residue or food build up behind!I've baked meatloaf and birthday cake just this last week and decided to see if these PowerBall Tabs could do the job it claimed. And to my surprise each pan came out looking as good as new! The powerful cleaners have also done a great job in removing tea and coffee stains from my favorite mugs! Our wine glasses have also come out spotless with no cloudy film that often is left behind when running them through the wash!Each of the Powerballs are individually wrapped which makes for easy storage and the wrapper keeps the appearance hidden from children that might think they were candy or something. To use you simply open them, throw away the wrapper, place the tablet inside the Main Dishwasher Detergent Dispenser And Close.The tablets are safe to use on china as well as glassware. The scent is very light and not overpowering in the least bit. I appreciate that because who really wants to drink out of a cup or eat off a plate that smells like a cleaner? Not me. Overall, I'm very happy with the product and would highly recommend it to other looking for a optimal way to clean their dishes in the wash. Great for everyday and even better for those busy baking days when everything seems to be caked on with something you would rather not soak for hours and scrub later!
