review/text: this product is a life saver for my wife and myself as it allows one of my boys to get to sleep .without going into any detail of his medical problems we were pulling our hair out as getting to sleep was a major issue so our doctor asked us to try melatonin and it worked for him. we are told it does not work for everyone but untill you try who knows. thanks country life . the product is also well priced.
