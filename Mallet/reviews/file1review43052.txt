review/text: My wife was pregnant with twins and between gravity and the kids, the strain on her belly was getting unbearable. We picked up the cradle and upon first use, she could notice a difference. It helped support the kiddos and eased the stretch of the belly near her upper torso. We did at times have to get creative in hiding the cross straps on her shoulders for wardrobe, but for the most part the cradle was pretty discreet.
