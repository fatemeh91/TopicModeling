review/text: Reading the other reviews leads me to believe that this works diff entry for other people.I really like this product. I take it in the morning if I have a very early day and I really like to take it after lunch to prevent to &#34;food coma&#34;. Every time I take it I get a lot of energy aid feel warm. I think I loose some wheight with it but I do not take it regularly( as I probably should). I certainly don't experience any side effects, but I also feel that the dosage of 2 pils at a time is too much for me. If you take it , I defiantly recommend drinking a lot of water. Like a full glas every 30-45 minutes at least.
