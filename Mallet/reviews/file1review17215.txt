review/text: I bought this unit to replace a Norelco unit that died after a number of years. I liked my Norleco unit but it sure wasn't the professional unit my barber used to trim my mustache. I figured I would have to spend a fortune to get one like the barber so I looked for another Norelco like I had to no avail.I probably spent an hour reading reviews on Amazon. Lots of talk about beards, but not so much about mustaches. I took a chance on this one and it is terrific. If feels like what my barber uses. I am very happy with it.
