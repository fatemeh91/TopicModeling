review/text: I agree with the previous reviewer... these tweezers are great to lift ingrown facial hair buried in the skin, because of their "needle-like" tips. I also follow up with a flat tweezer to remove the hair completely.When I tried to use this pair, the hair either broke, or I could not get a good grip.That's not a problem, and does not affect my rating for them... because they do their job.My only regret is that I did not buy them years ago. I would probably have less scarring from digging out ingrown hairs with other needles/tweezers.Great buy
