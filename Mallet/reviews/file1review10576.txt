review/text: I bought this for my grandma who is 83 yrs old. She's been complaining of losing strength in her legs. She started using a cane two years ago but during winters, I'm afraid it wasn't stable enough.So far, she is happy with it. She says she keeps it next to the sofa because it helps her get up.Grandma says it was very easy to put together and really appreciated that I thought of her safety. I got her the bronze and she likes it more the standard black or silver.
