review/text: I replaced a very old Norelco that served me well for over 5 years. I tried the version of the Norelco that replaced mine and found it was terribly made. It looked like the cheapest possible plastic available in the world and felt lousy in my hand. The cut from the blade was good but I didn't like the little hinged blade guard. It just got in the way and added nothing positive. This Remington feels much heavier and sturdier. It feels better to hold and seems to give a decent trim to my mustache and beard. Its not as good as my old one, a little rougher but I prefered it slightly to the new Norelco version.
