review/text: I use this product 3 times/day for my blind min pin. I tried a different product but stopped. I have since read good reviews online and bought this product. I believe it is helping her. After 2-3 months, the cloudiness is slightly reduced and she blinks sometimes when I put my hand near her left eye. I pray she continues to improve. I also use an herb that I bought at the vitamin store for her eyesight. Keeping your dog in good health is also critical. Every dog is different and results may vary. I am doing whatever I can to keep up her quality of life. Good luck to us all.
