review/text: I was hesitant to register for these covers because of some of the negative reviews I read...However, my son is now 3 months old and we love the covers that we use! Some common complaints I have read mention shrinking, poor fabric quality, and staining easily; our experience has been quite different:-Shrinking is minimal (I generally wash in hot water because I'm getting poopy out, too)-Any shrinking that does occur does not prevent the cover from fitting, only makes it more snug (which I like)-Stains come out very easily with Dreft stain remover or Shout (neither alters the cover coloring either)-Of my four covers, two have loose threads from excessive washing (still in great shape-I consider the fabric quality excellent, especially considering the amount of washings these go through in the first few weeks!)-One thing to consider: Colors online are very different than in person...I found that the pictures online show darker, richer colors. I have 2 blue covers and one each of the yellow and white. The blue and yellow are much, much lighter in person (they appear to be very pastel); I find them more appealing!Like I mentioned, I have four of these covers. They are fantastic and I recommend them to everyone. Buy more than one though, because they definitely get dirty quickly--I think I changed mine every day for the first 2-3 weeks that my son was home!
