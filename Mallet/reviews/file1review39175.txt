review/text: First impression: as other reviewers have stated- "Wow this thing is heavy! It must be professional grade! And look at all these cool accessories!"Upon closer inspection: the "chrome" part is just a silver painted area of the cheap plastic shell. I dont know what makes this trimmer so heavy, but quality definitely plays no part. Also, the accessories are a joke- they are made from some kind of super thin and brittle plastic that holds up under only the most gentle treatment. I threw away the scissors after I discovered that they would not cut paper, let alone my thick red hair.Oh- and the cheapo little storage box it all comes in; I challenge anybody to fit all the accessories back in there (without breaking any of them) and post the video! I am not sure it is even possible.Actual performance: The clippers worked tolerably well once. Even that first time was rough going, constantly having to stop and unclog or re-oil the blades- but at least they worked. By the second use however, they were starting to get dull so it took almost an hour to trim my hair back to an even 3/4". On the third haircut a screw rattled its way loose and since then I have to tighten it 3-4 times per haircut or else it rattles loose and the trimmer starts to sound, and cut, like a lawnmower.The good:-a cheap, all inclusive hair trimming kit.The bad:-You have to really work to get it to cut evenly, making numerous passes-accessories are a joke.-trimmer is heavy and LOUD!-blades dull very rapidly-trimmer vibrates excessively and may shake itself apart
