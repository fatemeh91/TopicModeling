review/text: This is an excellent pen but a mediocre-at-best stylus. The pen portion does everything well; red, black, pencil. It feels excellent in your hand and is solidly built. The downside is that when used as a stylus I have to press down significantly in order for my phone to register the swipe. I have a free pen / stylus that I got from a trade show that is MUCH better on the stylus side. In the end this item is just ok.
