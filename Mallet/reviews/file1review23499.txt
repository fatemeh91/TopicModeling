review/text: This soluable fiber, along with the information at [...], has changed my life. Doctors constantly tell us to "eat more fiber" but for IBS sufferers, all too often that leads to bloating, horrible gut spasms, abdominal pain, and constipation. The trick is getting SOLUABLE fiber into your digestive tract first, before eating anything else. This is the most convenient form of soluable fiber ever -- it has no taste, no texture, and no smell. Add water (or any cold beverage -- I find it does have a tendency to clump up in hot ones) to it slowly while stirring with a fork, let it sit a moment, stir it again and you wouldn't know it was there. I've been using this product for about 4 years now and am stabilized on a 1/2 tablespoon dose every morning; if having a really stressful day may take an additional dose in the evening, or have some before eating a trigger food (the tomato paste in pizza always wrecks havoc on my innards otherwise!). It helps immediately for diarrhea attacks; you have to build your way up slowly for some time for constipation relief, but eventually it gets there.I recommend purchasing this product first; if you like it, keep the cannister and order more of the product in the pouch as a refill. The cannister will last a good long time!
