review/text: This product may be very effective when used correctly, but I cannot recommend it simply because it is nearly impossible to use correctly. I had previously used a generic store brand and had hoped to achieve better results with these. After the first day, I can tell that the whitening effect is stronger; however, the overall result is probably diminished by the difficulty of usage.Some tips I learned the hard way:-Don't believe that you can just throw them on and do something else. I spent the entire time they were on in front of the mirror adjusting and dealing with saliva. Paper towel is almost a necessity. I can't help but think that those who just quickly apply them and do other things will end up with uneven results.-Don't rip the pouches open, use scissors. Ripping them will pull on the backing, and wrinkle up the strips before you can use them.-Immediately after placing the strip, wipe your fingers off before adjusting the strips. Adjusting could take a while, and your fingertips will turn white from the gel.I really think Crest could do a better job of making these strips easy to use. Some rigidity to the strips would do wonders. The backing should be a different material and the strips should be precut, something more like bandages would be nice. Also, why not make the lower strips as wide as the top? The material is there, they just cut a smaller strip out...I may end up with whiter teeth, but next time I'm using the old-fashioned tray and gel.
