review/text: I bought this item for the looks. I work Med/Surg as an RN. Acoustics were moderate in rating, I have used better sounding stethoscopes. This item was not abused in any way, but cracked in 3 places on the head within days of purchase. Dissatisfied customer. I would recommend an Ultrascope--Better acoustics, more expensive but better quality.
