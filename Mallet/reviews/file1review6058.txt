review/text: I had an arm cuff style unit that never gave me my pressure and I had paid over $100 for it. I was tired of the painful episodes with the cuff squeezing the blood out of my arm. I got this one a couple weeks ago and it is so convenient a child could use it and no pain at all. It always gives me my pressure reading too. I can't believe how much easier it is. It also has all the bells and whistles on it. I'm so glad the price was minimal through Amazon because I didn't want to put a lot into another unit and have it fail me. I would definitely buy this and if you want to know if the reading is as accurate as the doctors unit, take it with you and try it right after the doctor does it with his unit. I am going to do it the next appointment that I have. I feel that I would still use this even if the doctors is higher or lower because I can just add or subtract my units readings.Paula
