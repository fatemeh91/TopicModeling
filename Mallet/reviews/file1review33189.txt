review/text: This supplement is truly worth every penny! I use it at the onset of a cold and never get sick. It's one of those items that I always have on-hand. I don't have any issues with the way they smell, however the pill is like a large vitamin. I take six pills 2x a day when I'm feeling sick and stop taking them either when my symptoms have passed or if once I'm no longer exposed to sick people. They also make a kids liquid version, which I give to my baby and also recommend. Can't say enough good things!
