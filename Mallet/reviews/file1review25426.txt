review/text: When it worked, this compact trimmer did a good job. Unfortunately the motor died after a few months. The trimmer first developed problems with starting, where it would take a few taps on the housing to get the motor going. Performance deteriorated until it finally refused to start at all. The motor reminds me of the cheap DC motors used in model planes, that fail after minimal use. Maybe I got a lemon, but this trimmer was a total disappointment. It is cheap, so if it does die, at least you won't lose too much.
