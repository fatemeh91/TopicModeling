review/text: A week ago I never would have thought I would write this review. First of all, I do not write reviews. Second of all, I like German products in general and have been mostly satisfied with the Braun electric razer I used until it broke. So, I was looking at buying the new Braun which costs $200.00 which I thought was a ridiculous price, so I took a 'flyer' on the Wahl. It's the best! I like it better than my Braun! I like the flexibility of the twin head foil/cutter of the Wahl much better and because of this, I get a closer shave, more quickly. With the Braun I would have to go over certain areas literally 4, 5, 6 times to really 'get it'. The Wahl sounds like a damn chain saw, because it has this sooped up American style car engine for a motor, but it shaves the closest of any electric razor and more quickly, than any I have ever used. God Bless good 'ole American engineering on this one! Okay, the plastic housing looks cheesy and non-sexy compared to the Braun, but the Wahl is a loyal lover who satisfies the most. You know, sometimes we Americans just get the job done. So, I am writing this review because I think this is the best product and for sure at the best price so I believe it's time to thank Wahl and for that matter, sincere and honest and solid American companies. I do not work for Wahl. I do not know anyone who does. I do not even know what State they are in and I do not care. Just keep up the good work!
