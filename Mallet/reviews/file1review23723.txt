review/text: Fantastic. How could something that costs about 14 dollars make you feet feel so good. You have to try it to believe it. Thought they would last about 6 months which would be fine with me. But, it's about a year and a half now, and except for a little discoloration of the top pad, there is no evidence they've been used. By the way, I use them with the Reebok Classic, and it fits perfectly. I chose the 3/4 model. Gives your toes that extra room.
