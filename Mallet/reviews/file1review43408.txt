review/text: The item it's self is true to size and very comfortable.I am 33 weeks Pregnant now in my second pregnancy...Through out the pregnancy there were days I couldn't walk at all do to my hip joint feeling as if it was grinding and going to pop out of place...I bought a pregnancy belly belt that just went under from sears and it was so uncomfortable and didn't feel like it help anything...So I bought this combo after searching their website and reading reviews... I have to say it feels wonderful! I didn't expect it to help completely and figured their would be some discomfort but, I was wrong.True to sizeComfortable fitLight weightDiscrete and breathable materialAll though it is light weight it actually put's enough pressure and holds me in without causing discomfort or pain...I am very happy I got this! Now all I need to get is a pregnancy pillow and I will be for ever happy :)
