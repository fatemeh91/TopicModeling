review/text: Although these blades are marketed for men, I am a woman and love them more than the Venus "women's version". If you like the Venus handle though these blades will clip right on, I love it. And talk about long lasting- I kid you not: I shave my armpits every time I shower- almost everyday, and it is sick but I have used the same blade for weeks and weeks! I don't recommend that, but you've gotta do what you've gotta do. Mach3 may be on the expensive side but they last longer and work better (very smooth shave) than any blade I've tried.
