review/text: I've used Dymatize brands plenty of times in the past and this protein powder is one of the best tasting I've used. I go for vanilla over chocolate because it mixes best with anything (fruit, peanut butter, homemade protein bars, etc.) This is one of the best prices for whey isolate you will find. Supposedly isolate is a higher quality than concentrate, it definately mixes easier - although I've never had a problem with either. Just use a hand blender (the one that fits in a cup) or shaker cup. Mixing will not be a problem.And to all the people who complain about gas - this is what happens when you increase your protein intake so either let 'er rip or walk away real quick. Once you get used to the increased protein you will not have as much gas, don't let that stop you from picking a protein powder.A+ for this brand, I have also used their ZMA which is great as well.
