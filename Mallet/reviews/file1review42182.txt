review/text: I got my first container of this from my mom several years ago. I don't notice much differance for the really severe pain, but for anything else, the amount of relief is absolutely phenomenal. I was absolutely astonished. When I could not find it after a move, I immediately ordered a new one with super fast (and expensive) shipping so I would not have to be without for very long. The container looks a little different, but it still works the same. I love it!
