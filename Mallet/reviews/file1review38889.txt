review/text: I was doubtful about liking this disposable razor, because I had been stuck on another brand for a long time and I was very satisfied with it. However, I must admit, when my supply runs out, I will be purchasing more of this kind! It makes for a very smooth and comfortable shave, and the little protective strip along the top didn't get gooey after one use like others that I've seen.
