review/text: I believe this product probably has helped many women with IRREGULAR cycles, BUT if you have a regular cycle DO NOT USE!!!I was very regular, ovulating on CD 8/9 until I started taking this product. I have been taking it for almost one month now and I'm on CD 15 and still no ovulation. (I use the CBE fertility monitor, I would have 2 high fertility days right before ovulating, I've had 5 high fertility days now...)I believe Fertilaid is the culprit as it is the only thing that has changed. I have stopped taking the pills and hope my next cycle will be back to normal.I only wish I had read the reviews on here before buying!!!!UPDATE: I'm on CD 27 and still have not ovulated. AF should have started by now, but hasn't. Again, please consider carefully if you have a regular cycle.UPDATE: I started my next cycle and ovulated on my usual CD9. Is it a mere coincidence that I used Fertilaid for approximately 1 month and did not ovulate and after having stopped using Fertilaid my next cycle was normal ovulation time?
