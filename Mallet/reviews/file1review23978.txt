review/text: I own the C8080wz and the OEM battery (this one) that came with it is still going strong after several years of heavy use. It is not cheap, but you get what you pay for. I made the mistake of purchasing an off brand version of the battery and from the very start it held a charge for about half the time of the Olympus version. Now it lasts for only a short while before it is depleted. The Olympus battery still is at about 90% of its original capacity which means I can take it out for a day of shooting without worrying about it dying on me.My C8080 is still a terrific camera. You better believe that when I need a replacement battery, I am going to get a BLM-01 next time.
