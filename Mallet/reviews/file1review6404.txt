review/text: I purchased this product back in October, after using a friends at work. It is so awesome! I had to have one after using my friends. I accidently ordered the wrong type, so I exchanged it for the blue newest model that is in the picture. It is slightly different than my freinds. Anyway they have the best customer service! I called and emailed them when I realized I had ordered the wrong one. They responded very quickly to my phone call and email! I was extremely impressed! They sent the correct massage cane to me quickly. Most of all I love this product and everyone at my job and in my family wants it after they try it! Excellent customer service!!!! I will buy more from this company for sure!
