review/text: I tried the over the counter guards that you boil and ended up looking like a boxer after a fight with my jaw and mouth sore from the bulky size of these type of guards. I decided to try Sleep Right guards and am so glad I did. The guard works perfectly without being big and bulky so you get the protection and sleep comfortably. I don't know how sturdy it is as I've been only using it for a few days but hopefully it lasts as well but that's left to be seen....
