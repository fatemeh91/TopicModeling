review/text: I bought this sprinkler to save a section of our yard when that sprinkler zone stopped working. I am very glad that I made the purchase as it has saved me the cost of having to hire a sprinkler company to come fix the zone. Instead, I was able to wait until my dad returned from overseas so that he could teach me how to fix it myself.I figured I would use this thing for a couple months and then toss it out when I no longer needed it. After 2 months of biweekly use, I don't see any sign of wear or fatigue on the unit. I certainly thought I'd at least see the gears showing wear or maybe some calcium deposits. I think I will either keep this up in the attic for a (non) rainy day or maybe donate it to Habitat for Humanity.Overall, a great value for the price I paid.
