review/text: After 3 mos of successful breast feeding I had gallbladder surgery and I've been struggling with my milk supply since my baby is now 7mo and I'm only able to pump out 1/4 ounce total from both breast, a couple of days on more milk plus and my milk went up to 1 to 1 1/2 ounces total from both breast and continued that way pretty much till I ran out of drops so I talked to a lady at motherlove (very nice people) and she asked me a few ? about how I'm taking the drops and then she asked if my breast size had gone down and I told her my breast size has went from a full D to now a small C she thought I would do better on the special blend b/c it has goat's rue which helps build the mammary gland (that holds the milk) she thought that maybe my body absorbed some of my mammary gland (after my surgery) and that's y I couldn't produce enough milk even while on the more milk plus. so I'm waiting for the special blend and I will post a review on motherlove more milk special blend once I try it.
