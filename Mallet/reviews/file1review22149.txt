review/text: This multivitamin causes me to throw up. I've been taking gummi vitamins and Floradix before I tried to make the switch to this more affordable multi + iron.The first morning I thought that throwing up was a fluke. But this morning, sure enough--5 minutes after taking the vitamin and while I was making my oatmeal, I had to run to the bathroom and throw up. I'm definitely not pregnant. I haven't felt nauseous at any other point during these two days. The vitamin is the only change. What a drag.
