review/text: I've been testing this product for a few days now, and I must say that I'm pretty impressed. You use the rinse before brushing, swirl it around like a mouthwash for a few minutes, then you brush. After I used the Plax (before I even brushed) my mouth already felt clean, cleaner than it usually does from brushing alone. I don't know if my teeth actually were whiter, but they were definitely cleaner. I have sensitive gums, and usually when I floss I have a little bleeding, but after using the Plax there was hardly any bleeding from my gums. That in itself is worth it to me, so not only does it help your teeth, it also helps keep your gums healthy. I can only hope they come up with a children's version, one with a bubble-gum or fruity taste so we can get our kids to use it. I definitely think they would benefit from this product as well.
