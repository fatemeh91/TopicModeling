review/text: This was recommended to a friend of mine by his doctor. I'm usually very skeptical of herbal treatments, but since the recommendation came from a regular medical doctor, I decided to give it a try. I am blown away by the results. I have been on this product for about 18 months, and my cholesterol has dropped from 252 to 192. I made no other significant changes in my diet. What's more, I am only taking two capsules a day instead of the recommended dosage of four per day. I've read that the big pharmaceuticals are campaigning to require this product to be sold only by prescription. I pray this never happens.
