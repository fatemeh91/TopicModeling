review/text: These little bottles definitely have a noticeable effect on my memory and energy levels. I take one every day, M-F when at work. I haven't experienced any decay in effect like the other reviewer posted.They do taste pretty bad though, but the taste doesn't linger in your mouth after a drink of water. For the price, they're worth it.
