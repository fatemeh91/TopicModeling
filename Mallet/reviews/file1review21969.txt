review/text: Only problem I have is over use. I've been having some knee pain after twisting my knee. Have used this for plane rides, long meetings where sitting too long. This helps you from putting your leg / knee into a position that will hurt. Really helped improve. When I wear it too long - 6+ hours, the straps sometimes slide down into my knee. Just need to keep tightening, or wear it a little shorter length. Would definitely buy again.
