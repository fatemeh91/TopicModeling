review/text: Which just about says it all!This potty seat is easy for my daughter to put on the potty and remove. We have a hook on the wall for hanging it when she's not using it. She seems to find it comfy to, judging from how long she's willing to sit there sometimes. And, best of all, it's relieved her totally valid fears of falling into the big potty, which means a lot less little potty clean-up for us.This is our 3rd potty seat. The other two had soft, foamy seats, which try as we might, we couldn't keep clean. We ended up tossing them, as they would eventually begin to smell, and become discolored from the inside out. They always seemed to leave my daughter's bum with an angry red rash too. So, the absolute best feature of this potty seat is how clean it is, how clean it stays, and how low maintenance it is. We wipe it down occasionally, but its wonderful design keeps it from getting waste on it, and keeps germs from accumulating.Lastly, it's easy to install for any toilet. We have one in both our bathrooms, and sent one to my daughter's preschool, so it fits large toilets as well.Despite the higher price, this is an item that will last a long time and function as expected. Ultimately, I believe that makes it worth the extra money.
