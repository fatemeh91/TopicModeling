review/text: I love how gentle this soaps is and I was looking forward to making baby soap and hand soap and shampoo etc. When I used it I noticed that it had a weird smell when I mixed it with anything. My husband told me the dish soap I made smelled like mold. I only added lemon juice and lemon essential oil but it did not mix well with the "unscented" castile soap. I don't know if this is just my husband and I who have this problem, but I do not care for the smell of this soap.
