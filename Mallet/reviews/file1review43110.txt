review/text: Since I was in my 7th month of pregnancy, it was getting heavier for me to work 12 hour straight a day while carrying a big bump with me. I had a bad muscle strain under my breasts. My OB doctor recommmeded me to get this cradle. And it worked perfectly for me. My muscle strain almost disappeared and I could be able to work until my 39th week. I would highly recommend this product.
