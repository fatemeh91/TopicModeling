review/text: I finally had to replace my old Oral-B electric brush, since it gave up the ghost. I would have given this toothbrush 4.5 stars if allowed, but my complaint is relatively minor, so I gave it 5. So - here's what I like:1. The way it cleans - hence the smile2. The variable speed feature3. The 'quadrant' timer - although the old brush told me when I was done, this one tells me when it is time to move from the front to back (or top to bottom, depending on your style).4. The battery gauge - much like a cell phone, it shows the level of charge. I can rev it up, then unplug until the gauge shows one bar (usually about 5 days, using it twice a day).5. The travel charge ring and case. This is one of my favorites. I used to travel without my electric because it was too bulky to take the whole stand. With the nifty removable charge ring (and the universal plug) and carrying case, I can easily take it anywhere.6. The heads from my old brush fit the new one. Couldn't believe someone actually designed an update that used parts from the older version! I'd just bought a new pack of heads when the old one died and was sure I'd just thrown away good money. A big 'atta boy' to Braun for this one!What I don't care about:1. The smiley face when you're done and have brushed long enough. Cute but extraneous.2. I think the display face also provides other information (besides battery level and smiley face), but when brushing, one can't see it, so who cares.What I don't like:The size of the handle. It doesn't fit my smallish, female hand as well as the old one. I've learned to manage, but it just isn't totally comfortable.In sum, it's a great brush and I'm 99% happy with it. So go ahead and get one - and brush happy!
