review/text: I liked this product, but I didn't feel it was markedly better or worse than any other product of its type. It dispenses as a pink gel that turns into a foam with a very slight, pleasant odor. It was easier to control the amount used than with other gels I've tried. Although I wouldn't necessarily recommend this product to my friends, I don't have anything particularly negative to say about it, either.
