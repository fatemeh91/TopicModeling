review/text: Despite the other reviews, I have been taking these pills for a month now and have had no problem with aftertaste or odor. They are a little large - but easy to go down.Because of the research of coconut oil with Alzheimers [...] I will be taking these for the rest of my life! They were recommended by my doctor and I would recommend these to anyone that has the Alzheimer's disease in their family!
