review/text: Ok, this item is not for the faint of heart. Two wheels of fast-spinning tweezer blades is super intimidating. I was afraid to try it, actually. I have been waxing my own legs & armpits for a year, so I am used to the feeling of hair being ripped out. Well, once I built up the courage to try it (on my legs first) I was SOLD!!! I epilated both legs (ankle to upper thigh) in the time it takes me to wax one leg from the knee down!!! It pays for itself compared to wax prices (even if you do your own). After doing my legs, I did my armpits - very pleased. I am now getting rid of ALL my messy wax. This is also an environmentally friendly product, as there's nothing to throw away!!! I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this. Just beware: if you have never waxed before, you definitely should before trying this product. There is NO way that ripping hair out at the root could be pain-free. Logic should tell you that. Also, I would never use this on "virgin" hair. But from a year of waxing, my hair grows back so thin & fine, that this is perfect. I would say waxing does hurt more than this product, though not pain-free. If you're used to waxing, BUY this!!!
