review/text: I had been using Walmart psyllium for about 10 years with good results, but the price was steadily increasing. Decided to buy in bulk. The Now Foods psyllium has pleasant taste and seems to work better than the Walmart brand. I am entirely satisfied with the product and would recommend to anyone.
