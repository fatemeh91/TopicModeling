review/text: I started buying protein shakes back in high school and one after another they tasted DISGUSTING!! You couldn't wait to get it down and the pain of actually having any of that stuff hit your tastebuds...uggh! So I looked online and found out that Optimum Nutrition supposedly makes good tasting whey protein powders. Well they aren't just good, they're actually GRRREEAAT! This is the only type of protein i've bought since then. Chocolate was the best flavor and they expanded on it with mint chocolate, double rich chocolate, chocolate shake, creamy chocolate, and now "extreme" chocolate. Basically, if you buy a chocolate flavored optimum nutrition shake, you're getting the best tasting protein out there for that price, hands down.
