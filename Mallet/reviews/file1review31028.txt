review/text: Bought this for a family member because of the product description -- which is wrong when it says "Ships complete, with easy to assemble snap on seat with lid and large 12 qt. capacity pail with lid". It ships completely broken down and must be fully assembled. The snap on seat is easy to assemble but it does not otherwise come complete. Also, the cross bars that hold in the bucket are too short and don't fit. I am going to bend them out to make them longer and then I think they will fit. Very disappointed. Otherwise, the product appears durable and good for the cost. I would probably give it 4 or 5 stars but for the bad description and the too short bars.
