review/text: Every once in a while a product that actually works well gets discontinued. Because of this product, I actually started flossing regularly. Now I am on my last disposable floss cartridge and these are going for $40 online for a pack of 15? That's disgusting. I should have known this was coming because I noticed the stores stopped carrying them. Long's was the last store to carry them and I should have cleaned them out of their floss refills. The only thing I didn't like about it was the button was oddly placed such that it was a little difficult for me to floss and push the button at the same time. The button should have locked to keep the vibration on instead of having to hold it down. Other than that, I can't say enough about the Hummingbird. Now I'm going to have to spend a bunch of time testing other potential solutions until I find something new that works for me. This is one of the products that should NOT have been discontinued. Especially considering it had no other competition.
