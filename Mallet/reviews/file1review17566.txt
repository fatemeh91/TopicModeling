review/text: When the trimmer is working properly, it works wonderfully. The trimmer has plenty of power, and the trim adjustment range is more than adequate for me. Where it falls short, however, is in its ability to hold a charge. Like several other reviewers, mine worked great for the first few weeks, but now it only runs at full power (for about 10-15 seconds). It seemed like a great trimmer for the price, and it would be if it weren't for its inability to hold a halfway decent charge.
