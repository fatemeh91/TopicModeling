review/text: I got this as one of the gifts off my wife's xmas wish list. She loves this thing. It helped her recover from the planter fascitis she was experiencing. She now uses it on which ever shoe she wear daily for an extended time.We had gone to a "custom fit" shoe/orthodic store first and it would have costs much more then this one for a set. So we were very happy to find this one.
