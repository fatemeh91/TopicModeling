review/text: The taste of the "gourmet vanilla" was too extremely offensive for me not to write this review and warn others. I am not someone who is new to artificial sweeteners.I hate to be so proud but I consume the likes of equal, splenda, sweet-n-low etc daily because I avoid sugar at all costs. However, even with my accustomed taste-buds I have a difficult time drinking the very bitter gourmet vanilla. The powder mixes well, so maybe other flavors are ok, but avoid vanilla.
