review/text: You know, it's the year 2011. I went through puberty, and subsequently began shaving, 25 years ago. In all this time, with all the technological advances made to date, I cannot believe that they still have not fixed the problem with shaving cream cans and the rust stains they leave on surfaces. Why, oh why, is this still a problem? You use the shaving cream once, and the next time you get into the shower and pick up the can, there is a stain on the porcelain (or fiberglass, because BATH technology has advanced, even if shaving foam cans have not). Why should I have to paint clear nail polish onto the bottom of my shaving foam cans to prevent this? Why aren't THEY taking care of that problem themselves? Shaving cream in a can is a solution to the problem of getting a close shave without razor burn, but what use is a solution that only creates other problems? I will not be buying shaving foam in a can again until someone wakes up and deals with this issue. This is ridiculous.
