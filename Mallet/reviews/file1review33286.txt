review/text: I am prone to migraines. They start in my neck and work their way up and out. My neck, shoulders and back ache when the migraine gets really bad. I have found that moist heat to be very helpful to help relieve the pain. I've been using rice bags for about 5 years to aid in the moist heat department, and I've tried all kinds: rice, cherry pits, herbs.. you name it.My last heading pad got a whole in it yesterday, and I'm in the middle of a week long migraine. I ordered this wrap thinking it would be the ticket, because it encompasses the neck and the shoulders. Let me tell you, this pad is phenomenal! Not only was there lightning fast shipping (got it in a day!) but the pad is perfect! The chambers are well sown to distribute the herbs evenly and to stay in place. It curls around my neck and drapes over my upper back and shoulders providing great relief to these problem areas. It also feels 'heavy' on my achy shoulders which causes them to relax and not to contract up. The cover of the wrap is made of this really soft almost fuzzy... fleece? type material that feels lovely.I am going to order more of these. At least two more. I'm very happy with this product!
