review/text: This is the best sour throat medication out there. It very quickly take away the sore and replaces it with cool soothing feeling. I have tried several different brands and always come back to this one. It also clears your sinus as well. What I really like about this is that it is thick and the coating stays on your throat for a while where other brands are watery and slide right down our throat. i just ordered a bottle of this stuff from Amazon since it's getting harder to find this in stores for some reason.
