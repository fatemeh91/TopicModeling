review/text: I bought the sandalwood variety. It smells terrific and leaves your skin feeling great. I hate to shave and would keep a beard if it wasn't so much trouble to maintain. I have sensitive skin and shaving is a nightmare because I'm left with painful spots that hurt all day (new blades or old). Most after shaves and balms result in skin irritations if not pimples. With this balm my skin feels unbelievably good, no ailments yet. The other day I wanted to shave a second time just to be able to apply the balm :) Two thumbs up and a chin.
