review/text: This unit does what it is supposed to do for the most part when used as regularly as suggested. It nonetheless incurs costs above and beyond those you'd normally expect, and it doesn't cover as much of the shower/tub as I hoped it would. The unexpected costs are one of the primary reasons it scored so low.For one, the unit is power hungry, and goes through batteries like no other device I've ever used. Expect one-and-a-half to two weeks, at most, from a set of brand new AA batteries. The instructions on the unit and the manual state not to use rechargeable batteries, but, being the experimental type, I tried them anyway. The unit played its 15 warning beeps and...didn't work. It worked fine when regular batteries were re-installed. Not being able to use rechargeable batteries is disappointing.Another problem is the coverage area. It covers most of the shower in its spray, but misses the area about 1.5 feet above the tub/shower floor. This area will need to be cleaned as you normally would.Finally, the unit uses a lot of fluid, or it evaporates very quickly. We went through two and a half bottles of fluid in a given month, running it once a day for two weeks, then cutting back to every other day when we saw how much fluid was used. Since the bottles cost $4 each or more, that's an unexpected cost that adds up quickly.With its excessive power requirements, inconsistent spray area, and fluid usage, I don't think this unit is worth the money. The increased costs in battery consumption and fluid evaporation, as well as the coverage area, nullify any cleaning benefits provided. The only folks who benefit from this unit would be those who can't do the cleaning themselves due to injury or some other ailment. Otherwise, save the money and use elbow grease and a cleanser every other day or so.
