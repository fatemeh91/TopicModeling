review/text: When I was in GNC once I compared the nutrition label on the GNC brand whey with the the Optimum Whey, and the Optimum was the healthier option. So I've stuck to buying Optimum over the years, and of course buying it on Amazon is always cheaper. I've found that the Strawberry and Chocolate flavor variations tend to be tastier than the vanilla. It seems like that one leaves more of an aftertaste too, but perhaps everyone's taste is different. I tend to buy the smaller sizes so I can change up the flavor more often.
