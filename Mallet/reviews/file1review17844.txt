review/text: This may look similar to other pill dispensers, but there's a reason it's so much cheaper. It is just a 28-slot pill box that also happens to have a place to hold an alarm clock. It does not control access to the meds or advance automatically. Fine if you need to keep track of a complicated med schedule, but it won't prevent someone with memory problems from taking their meds at the wrong time. BTW, the one I got came with a dying battery in the clock, which means that before I can even use the reminder feature I have to go buy a new battery.
