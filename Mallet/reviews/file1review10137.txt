review/text: To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. Unfortunately, Amazon does not provide label information so you don't get to see what Vitamins and Minerals are actually in the product until you buy it.Instructions say to take two per day. Two of them provide only 10% of Minimum Daily Requirement of Vitamin E, 25% of Vitamin B-6, 465 of the Pantothenic Acid, 17% of the Calcium, 13% of the Phosphorus, 2% of the Magnesium, 3% of the Zinc and 10% of the Copper you need every day.The list of Vitamins and Minerals that it doesn't give you is long starting with NO Vitamin K, No Selenium, No Chromium, No Molybdenum, No Chloride, No Vanadium, No Boron, No Tin, No Silicon and No Nickel.these are all present in other inexpensive multi-vitamins and Minerals available through Amazon like Nature's Bounty ABC Plus at $6.79 for 100 day's supply. 100 days worth of Thompson's would cost $8.31 and be missing or have lower amounts of the above Vitamins and Minerals.Of course, more expensive Daily Vitamin and Mineral doses would contain even more of needed Vitamins and Minerals than these inexpensive ones do but many of them are not too much more than these cost.
