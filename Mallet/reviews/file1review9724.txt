review/text: I previously used loose green tea from Alvita for years; then all of a sudden I couldn't get it anywhere. I was delighted to find it on Amazons a couple of weeks age. I don't make a cup of tea; I make a pitcher of tea. It was most aggravating to tear open tea bags to put in my tea maker. And No, bags don't do well in the modern tea makers. I have tried many brands of green tea, and I have found Alvita green Tea to suit my taste best. It was shipped within a week. Wonderful! I certainly will be ordering more.
