review/text: I had a vicious sore throat that had me searching amazon reviews for well-reviewed products to try. After trying Cepacol I don't know what the fuss in these reviews are about.Yes, the product fairly effectively numbed my sore throat. Unfortunately, it numbed everything else in my mouth along with it--which seems to be the common problem with all these products. I wish I could find something that soothed my sore throat but didn't numb my tongue and everything else along with it.For me I guess I'll stick with 800mg Advil whenever I get a bad sore throat over using these...
