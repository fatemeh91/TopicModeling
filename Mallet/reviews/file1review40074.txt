review/text: I love this product. This may be the first tartar protection toothpaste that didn't leave a bad taste in my mouth. One of the best features is the ""Neat Squeeze"" dispenser. This feature helps to reduce much of the frustration that's associated with the conventional toothpaste dispenser. I'd recommend this product to anyone I associate with.
