review/text: I was really excited about this bath tub for my baby. As soon as I was done using it I would either wash it, or let it air dry. Once a week, I would even throw it in the washer. That didnt seem to help at all. I only used the tub for about 3 weeks before I threw it out. I couldnt seem to get the spongy smell out. It was disgusting!
