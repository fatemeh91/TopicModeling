review/text: Okay, we tried the Clean Shower spray which did not work on soap scum. I did some online research & found several good reviews for this product. I could only find it at my local Target store, but am glad to see that Amazon carries it, but in bulk.For the last two years, I have been forced to take showers rather than taking baths, & I totally prefer to take baths. My boyfriend & I were forced to share a bathroom when we moved two years ago. With him being a mechanic, the tub got pretty nasty. Ohhh how I longed for those days when we had seperate bathrooms.To make it short, this stuff really does work to my amazement. I no longer have calluses on my feet anymore since bathing helps exfoliate your skin faster & makes it softer. I figured all of this out when I started taking showers. For the past week, I have been taking baths everyday. NICE SMOOTH SKIN AGAIN & I GET A CLOSER SHAVE.My boyfriend & I both spray the tub after we use it. With the Clean Shower spray, soap scum started to build up, but when we started using this Method Daily Shower Spray, it dissolved the build up that the Clean Shower spray had left behind. AFTER USING IT FOR A WEEK NOW, I RUBBED MY FINGERS AROUND THE TUB & NO SOAP SCUM RESIDUE!!!As for the scent, it really is not that bad. It reminds me of baby lotion but smells nothing like a dirty diaper which I read in one reveiw. I believe this product is all natural as well, so no rinsing required. EXTREMELY CONVENIENT TO USE AS IT ONLY TAKES ME 10 SECONDS TO SATURATE THE TUB. THE TRIGGER BAR ALLOWS US TO HANG IT ON OUR SHOWER ROD. WITH EVERYDAY USE TWICE A DAY, IT APPEARS THAT ONE BOTTLE OF THIS STUFF WILL LAST ABOUT A MONTH. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS STUFF!!!
