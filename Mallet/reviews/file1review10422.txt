review/text: I have been using Laci Le Beau Super Dieters Tea for years. There is no subsitute. Many women in my family use it as well. This keeps me moving better than anything else and I suffer from Chronic Constipation. I would recommend this to anyone who could use a gentle, natural laxitive. I've never felt like I've taking a harsh stimulant, it just makes you feel & go like normal :) I hate poop talk but this is worth sharing! LOL
