review/text: I purchased these recently, and I am very happy with the taste and quality of these vitamins. I feel better, whenever I take them in the mornings. These are high quality whole food vitamins. I had always bought them at my local health food store, but I saw them on Amazon.com and decided to order them to see if there was a difference. They are exactly like the health store ones, except for being a whole lot cheaper in price than what I was charged at the health food store. I will be ordering these from now on and save money.
