review/text: I bought the Psyllium Husk as an additional extract to add to my power shakes - my shakes include protein powder, flax seed, chia seed, and this Psyllium husk. It helps me fill up since I use my shakes as a meal replacement. In addition, it provides bulk and slows down travel time through your intestine which gives your body more time to absorb other nutrients in your food. This is good value for money compared to my local store and is a pure product.
