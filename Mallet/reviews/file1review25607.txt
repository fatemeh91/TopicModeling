review/text: I have bought two of these and both sufferred the same terminal problem after a few months useage. The blade seems to get stuck against the external metal housing at the tip. You can unscrew the tip and the blades rotate, but reattaching the tip stops the blade movement. I've taken both units apart and reassembled which sometime temporaily fixes the problem. No more for me... nostrils will just get hairier..
