review/text: I had a second line (faint, but dark enough to be photographed) on these tests, visible at 3 minutes and developed at 5, on 95% of the 15 I ordered. The "read by" 5 minutes and discard after 5 minute instructions are also ludicris since the dye is nowhere done clearing the window until approximately 8-10 minutes. These instructions must be a CYA for this shop since the false positives and evaps are so bad.I was so desperate for a positive that I spent over $100 on major brand tests (CBE, EPT, First Response, AccuClear, Equate) trying to confirm the lines I was getting on the early-pregnancy-test midstream. I never got a second line or positive result on any other test, with the same urine sample.Which brings me to another point -- don't even bother trying to use these as midstreams. You'll ruin them, finger over the window or not. The test area is not fully protected. They must be dipped into a cup of collected urine.Lastly, this company is neglectful by not including instructions with the test. When you are ready to test, the last thing you want to do is have to access the internet to get the instructions. These are considered medical devices and regulated by the FDA; therefore, instructions should be provided. They also do not provide instructions for dipping in a cup on the website. I dipped for 15 seconds, a good average between most major brands.
