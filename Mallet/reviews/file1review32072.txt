review/text: I've heard numerous things about this product, but I had never used it until today. During work, I spilled a significant amount of coffee on my white khakis. Since this happened in the morning -- and I didn't want to walk around with glaring stains all over my pants -- I rushed over to a near by Target to pick this product up. To my amazement, this product removed 95% of the stains on my pants. I'm now a believer and will be ordering the six pack from Amazon.
