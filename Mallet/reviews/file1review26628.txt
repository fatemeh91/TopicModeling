review/text: It is lightweight and easy to position on the back of a chair. It is very comfortable and gives good support for 2-3 hour keyboarding and most important of all it doesn't leak so you don't have to adjust the comfort level every time you use it. I wish it came in a few more colors. Plan on buying more.
