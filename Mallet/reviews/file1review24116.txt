review/text: The product does an excellent job at spot cleaning rugs. It makes red wine and coffee stains disappear after a short length of time, often without even touching the stain. The fresher the stain the better it works. It also does an excellent job on other type stains. I use it to pretreat a dirty rug before steam-vaccing. Make sure bottle says "Thriple Action" as this is the improved version that takes the red out. Also, the product deoderizes and puts down a stain preventer. I often use a portable spot lifter to rinse out the stain after letting the product set for a few minutes and then use paper towels to blot it up.
