review/text: I place a box of this in my husband's tennis bag every month---WAY more effective than plain old Gatorade, etc., and has almost completely stopped his problems with leg cramping during tournaments. Have a hangover? I've got the cure - drink 1-2 Emergen-C's and a couple of ibuprofen - voila! You will be feeling better in no time! Wonderful for flu & cold season too. Buy this stuff - you won't be sorry.
