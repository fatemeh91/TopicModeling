review/text: I've had a recurring knot in my upper back for the past several weeks, and I haven't had any consistent success in getting relief. I can't say the Body Back Buddy has cured my ailment, but it has let me get much-needed relief. It's a crazy-looking thing, but it's very sturdy and versatile. The various knobs do an excellent job of letting you get as much or as little focus on specific spots as you want, though those same knobs lend some of the handles an unfortunately phallic look. That aside, the BBB is a great tool. I recommend it very highly.
