review/text: KAL "Potassium-99" Potassium Chloride 99mg is an excellent product. I take a medicine that acts as a diuretic which means that I need extra potassium and I DON'T need the calories in an extra 10 bananas per day in order to get it. I also DON'T need a self appointed Food Police nanny telling me what to do. Potassium chloride is the preferred form of potassium to take if you are going to take a supplement.
