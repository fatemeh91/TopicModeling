review/text: This vibrator was a cult favorite... Its sister was the sexplorer vibrator and I personally knew at least five women that swore by it. The pink xplorer is actually better than the wahl and the hitachi magic wand put together...The vibrator is very quiet and very powerful. The high setting is best and offers incredible stimulation for menopausal women or those that need extra help.It is a little miracle worker...the clitoral nub is not bulky like the wand massagers but just the right size. This is a well made machine like the wahl but not irratating on the low setting and not overwhelming on high. Unfortunately not enough women knew about this vibrator and doc johnson discontinued it. I suggest that everyone who views this try emailing doc johnson to bring it back ...your sex life is important and this vibe is a 110v beautiful feeling...it can save marraiges and lesbian lovers...bitchy women unite!!!!
