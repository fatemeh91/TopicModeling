review/text: From the photo, this looked exactly like a hydrocollator I purchased 20 years ago (yup lasted 20 years with moderate use). This one has hardly any heat sink material in it. The canvas covering looks decent...but the lack of heat sink material is like a car with no engine; looks good...but not very useful. Very disappointed :(
