review/text: My review of the product:I thought cortisone cream did the best but this herbal cream did seem to provide some cooling effect and vaseline-like protection. Would I buy it again? Probably not.The title though reflects my disappointment in that one of the boxes was completely empty. Not worth asking for a replacement but it does linger in my mind.
