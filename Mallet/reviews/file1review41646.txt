review/text: I depend on reviews from other in deciding to purchase a product so that it is only fair that I return the favor. This toothbrush is great. In many ways I feel like I am getting my teeth cleaned at the dentist. We bought 2 of them and now I wish I bought more for family members who now have their own home. Pleased be advised that only one toothbrush comes with the product so pick up other brushes.
