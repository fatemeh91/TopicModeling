review/text: Even after my grown son had recommended it to me, I was a sceptic about this product . I have severe muscle spasms which require deep tissue massage on a regular basis and steroid-cortisone shots at times. The BBB works so well I can visit the massage therapist much less frequently and stay "on top" of my pain as well.The design allows the user to control the pressure and hit the trigger points and sore spots very easily. I also have problems with arthritis in my wrists, but this sturdy device allows me to leverage it for maximum pressure with no difficulty. Sitting in a car can be particularly painful to me, but using this during car rides has helped me immeasurably.I can't say enough about this heaven-sent product. I LOVE it!!!!!
