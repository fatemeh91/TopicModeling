review/text: I have eczema on my hands - that's how it started out. Being a mother of 2 and my hands always in water, the condition has gotten worse. When I went to the dermatologist, she said the skin on my hands has been compromised so much that it will never be the same and I will always have to deal with sensitive skin there. My hands get so irritated and inflamed that they really pain me. I can use steroids at times to get in under control, but she put me on to Acid Mantle as well. Love it. Really works and helps my skin heal and stay moisturized. When my hands are paining me, I put some on and the pain starts to go away. A-Mantle can be pretty expensive at the pharmacy, but I've found it to be reasonably priced at Amazon, and I'm sure other websites. Highly recommend for any dry skin or even Eczema.
