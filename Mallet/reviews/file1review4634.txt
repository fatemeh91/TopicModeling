review/text: I can't believe I ignored this razor when it first came out. I thought it was a marketing gimmick with the 5 blades. I stood behind my trusty Mach 3 razor. I was wrong. On a whim I picked up this razor and tried it out. I was amazed. It is so much better than the Mach 3. My face is smooth and I never get razor burn. With the Mach 3 I would get razor burn when I failed to change the blades often. If you think this razor is a gimmick you are missing out on a major improvement. I feel like an idiot for waiting so long to upgrade my razor.
