review/text: The "original protein bar". I started buying these when I was a teenager. I still like them, and they are less expensive than a lot of those sugary or crunchy protein bars that are on the market now. Some of the other bars are more like candy bars, and others taste so bad that I want something else afterwards just to get the taste out of my mouth. These are carob coated with a simple soft protein center. Good to stop the hunger on the run.
