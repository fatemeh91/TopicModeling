review/text: We love pampers premiums. They NEVER leak on either of my twins (boy or girl). (if someone is having leakage issues, move up a size!)These were a great buy when they were $7.49--they came close to BJs Wholesale price without the hassle of having to go there (and since I have twins we use a LOT of diapers). But the Yo-Yo pricing scheme of amazon ($7.49 one week, then $10.49 the next) is ridiculous. For one thing, a near 50% increase for ANY product is a lot, but to have it going up and down and up and down is infuriating. Amazon needs to get serious about diapers and make them a good deal consistently, or they will see their sales plummet thru the floor.
