review/text: I am a very large person with knee problems, I purchased this item for it's size which I am very satisfied with overall. The straps are not long enough but that is not a problem in my case because I can work with that. As one person said before it does not have a stiff support but for me it will serve the purpose of just tightening up my bad area giving me some type of support where I have none now. I am satisfied with my purchase although I plan to make adjustments.
