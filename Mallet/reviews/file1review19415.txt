review/text: I had a serious roach problem in my townhouse, and I tried everything to get rid of these bugs. This product was my last resort, and I have to say that I am completely satisfied with this pest repeller. The only downside is that sometimes I hear the frequency, but it is not so overpowering that I would stop using the product. I recommend using one product for each floor of your house.
