review/text: I took the monitor with me to my doctors office and boy was the readings way off! By 28 on the diastolic! The doctor told me the cuff was probably to small and to return the monitor and get one that had a larger cuff (9-17) instead of (9-13) which this one has. He stated it gives a false high reading when the cuff is to small as well as a false low if to big. He also stated to keep my arm postioned right,placing the cuff 1/2 above elbow and air tube running down the inside of your arm palm side up and keep the arm level with your heart for the most accurate reading.I returned this monitor and purchased the ReliOn Easy Wrap Automatic Monitor made by Omron as well, Model HEM-780 and its readings are alot more accurate as well as a much more comfortable cuff thats easier to put on by yourself one handed!Be sure to measure your upper left arm to make sure you purchase one that will fit properly.
