review/text: I've been using Optimum Nutrition (ON) whey protein for years and I was really excited to find it on Amazon.com & for subscription. I've tried many different types of whey over the years and found nothing even remotely comparable to ON's whey.Pro's:Taste - I love almost all of the different flavors I've tried (bunch of different chocolates, vanillas, strawberry, etc) with Extreme Milk Chocolate being my favorite. Whether mixed with milk or water it tastes like you're drinking a milkshake. You have to choke down some of the other proteins but ON is a joy to drink. The only flavor I've tried and didn't like is the Rocky Road but that was still better other brands I've tried.Mixability - an actual word and not something I just made up. ON mixes flawlessly with milk or water in just a simple shaker bottle. You can use a glass and a spoon but it takes longer and it doesn't mix quite as well as shaker. Some other brands I've used basically require a blender unless you like drinking solid chunks of protein paste.Nutrition - They can advertise this stuff better than I can but they have a high amount of protein per serving and loads of BCAA. When I researched whey protein supplements I looked at grams of protein per dollar spent and ON topped the list.Con's:Price - You get what you pay for and ON is more expensive than some of the other brands. It's well worth the money in my opinion or I wouldn't be writing this review. Also, with Amazon.com's normally low prices and the subscription cutting another 15% off it's hard to even consider price a problem.
