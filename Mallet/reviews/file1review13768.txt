review/text: I am not sure what to do with the safety tool, maybe give it to a fireman or EMT that could use it. I was pleasantly surprised with the sheath. There are an amazing number of carry options and I love the built in sharpener idea. That being said, I removed the scabbard from the webbing and attached only that to my pack straps. I was pleased to have that option as well. I bought another one for my nephew to take hunting as I was so impressed with the quality for the price. I also liked the shorter blade length.
