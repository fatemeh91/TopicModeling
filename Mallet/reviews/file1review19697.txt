review/text: This seat has worked very well for our 25-month-old boy. Very easy to use and clean, and also easy to remove and replace to allow adults to use the toilet. One caution: the splash guard in front will not always catch everything, especially if our son is not sitting centered and aligned with it, or if he moves around. You'll need to watch out for this, and you'll likely have a little spillage from time to time. Perhaps the next version can offer an expanded splashguard. I still think this seat is very much worth buying.
