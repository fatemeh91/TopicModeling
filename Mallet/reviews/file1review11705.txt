review/text: This is the first time I am writing a review for a product. These drinks saved our lives. Our son is really a picky eater, especially when he gets sick. After I quit nursing him(and because of the sicknesses, nothing serious just cold), he lost a pound in 2 months. Our doctor recommended us this brand. We tried a couple of different flavor and this is the one he liked the most. He is 21 months old and he is gaining weight more steadily right now and we are really happy that we found these drinks.
