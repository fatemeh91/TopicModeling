review/text: I got this for my husband who had rotator cuff surgery a couple of weeks ago and will be unable to use one arm for a while, but is anxious to keep up with flossing. He's quite happy with it -- he's been using the pick attachment and says it's not quite as good as regular flossing but very close. The y-shaped flosser attachment would probably work better, but neither of us has ever been able to negotiate one of those even by hand, never mind electric-powered. I haven't tried it myself but would like to give it a shot, since like many here, I hate flossing!
