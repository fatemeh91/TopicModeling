review/text: This product is an embarrassment to the brand.Installed a brand-new Duracell battery in a brand-new trimmer and attempted to trim for a solid two minutes. This effort resulted in no appreciable impact.I specifically and repeatedly targeted a particularly irksome offender, using every conceivable angle of attack, throughout which it stubbornly and valiantly resisted the so-called blade.I should add that while it fails to trim anything, the device does in fact result in sensations that cannot be called pleasurable as it pulls on your nose hairs in futility.In case this is not enough to dissuade you from making this purchase, the device also produces an unpleasant and potentially harmful ozone smell.
