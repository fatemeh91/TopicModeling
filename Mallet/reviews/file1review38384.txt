review/text: This is a very good product. I used it on my legs when I first recieved it in the mail and the emjoi removed the hair from my legs very nicely. There is a key to helping yourself achieve very smooth legs. That is to progress very slowly in a given skin area until there is no hair left on that patch of skin, then move on to the next area of skin on your leg or wherever you are epilating.What I want to make clear is that you most certainly will feel persistent pain the first few times of use, afterwards your skin will get used to it, hopefully.
