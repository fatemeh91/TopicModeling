review/text: Take a heaping tablespoon of that road kill that's been rotting along your local highway for weeks, 2 teaspoons of putrid slime from the corners of your household garbage bin, add 1 cup of murky Porta-Potty toilet water, then filter the potent brew through your funkiest gym socks and, VOILA!!! You've duplicated the flavor of this L-Arginine supplement. But, the healthy vascularity (and morning 'hardware') makes it all worthwhile :)On a packaging note: Since the product typically fills only half of its current jar, I'm always wishing it were bottled in a shorter 'tub' without the tapered closure, i.e. a wide-mouthed opening I can more easily dip into with big hands... including a pre-measured 5gm scoop would be useful too!
