review/text: Great product. When put in the freezer, the gel stays flexible and comfortable to wear and retains cold without giving you freezer burn. When warmed in the microwave, it retains heat and is very soothing. It's comfortable enough just to wear for support without freezing or heating. I like the way it covers the entire neck and extends down to between the shoulders.
