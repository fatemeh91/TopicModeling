review/text: Best toothbrush and well worth the money.I am very conscious of my oral health and brush my teeth at least twice a day for at least three minutes (sometimes more) and I have not used the charger for 20 days now and still have two bars left on the battery indicator. I travel alot and not packing the charger is one less thing to pack/worry about. My teeth have never felt so clean and looked so good. My gums are shiny and healthy and I really see and feel the difference. I will never go back to a traditional toothbrush again.
