review/text: I bought this for my son who has frequent lows. I purchased the 31-g tubes as an alternative to the 45-g tubes of Glutose 45 and because the price per g was half as much. Unfortunately, he told me (1) the tubes are not as easy to open as Glutose, (2) the tube can not be reclosed if he doesn't use the entire dose, (3) it's much thicker and more difficult to extract from the tube than Glutose. While it gets the job done, and isn't a bad product, when he's low enough to need glucose, he wants something he can actually get open and into him more easily than this product. Last time I checked, Glutose 45 is not available on Amazon.
