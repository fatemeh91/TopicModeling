review/text: I bought these after 6 months of using disposable nursing pads. I just hated wasting the money every 2 months for pads, and wanted to explore the washable options available.This was my first try, and I LOVE them! I just bought a second set, so I have 6 pairs, and will almost always have one set clean.I've washed them in the laundry bag they came in and they came out great. Super comfy and absorbant. My daughter is 6 months old and we have started weaning her night feedings, and extending the time between regular daytime feedings as well due to the introductions of solids, so I find I am leaking more than I was. I also have a pretty heavy letdown, and while they don't shift too much, they will shift some - but so do the disposables.Overall, they are great, and I have already suggested them to several of my friends who are nursing moms!
