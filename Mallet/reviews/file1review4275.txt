review/text: I've been a faithful user of Gillette razor blades and replacement cartridges for many years! But, these replacement cartridges are the worst Gillettes I've ever used! The blades are dull big time, some cartridges have missing blade strips, the lubricating strip is green all the way (not green and white underneath), the orange color of the metallic part surrounding the trimmer is a darker than on my usual Gillette Fusion cartridges! I am pretty sure (200%) that these are copies, bad copies probably made in China! This is unacceptable! I got them from AllTheTimeWholesale through Amazon; I will no more buy my Gillette Fusion replacement cartridges from them! What a scam!
