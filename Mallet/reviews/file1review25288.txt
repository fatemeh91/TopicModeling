review/text: I suffer from Fibromyalgia. I have been nearly crippled from pain. I was at a point of going on disability rather than work. Over the years I have been given numerous perscription medications which only drugged me to sleep and never take away the pain. I was introduced to End Pain and to my amazement I am very nearly pain free. Because of the nature of Fibromyalgia, I don't think it is possible for a person that has had this condition for years to be pain free, but I am so close to being pain free that it is unbelievable. I feel better than I have in years and also sleep without being concious of pain. I combine this product with Curamin (or Curcumin) and I am very nearly functioning as I did before I was diagnosised with Fibromyalgia. Other than taking care of personal business, I have not missed one day of work due to my condition (I was missing 1 to 3 days per week).
