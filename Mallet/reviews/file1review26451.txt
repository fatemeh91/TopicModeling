review/text: I like that it is small but my 2 speed vibrator goes way faster than the pocket rocket. It took like 15-20 min to get me off when i expected to feel it within 5-10 min like my 2 speed vibrator. I wish i could get my money back but i already used it. Can I still return it and get a full refund?
