review/text: I am a person who leads a very healthy lifestyle. I can't even begin to choke this stuff down no matter what I mix it with. It has by far the grossest aftertaste EVER! It may be good for you...if you can find a way to ingest it. I definitely cannot. Don't waste your money, it smells gross, it tastes worse and it won't do anyone a bit of good if it stays in the container it was purchased in. YUCK!! I don't even think it deserves one star. So annoyed that I wasted my money.
