review/text: I have severe pain my in neck and back with calcium build up in the tendons that are spongy and crunchy . With the BBB I can place it on pressure points and apply light pressure to help me crack an ache in my joints that I could not do with out it . Now it can take away a negative pain and have a mild positive pain while doing so that stops instantly when you let up . The balls on it do help to massage tight muscles . It has done more for me than 7 so called doctors and a chiropractor combined . I suggest using it very easy with only slight pressure and you will have to find out where your sweet spot is as you can easily hurt yourself if not careful .I plan on getting a second one to mod with padding and submit once I have a prototype that I am happy with . Padding will be removal able .It should have came with instruction DVD that I bought from another vendor . I had two friends think it was a sex toy when I showed it to them . Would like to be able to remove the balls and have multiple places the selection where to screw in .I quit wasting money going to my chiropractor as he has hurt me and I had to teach him how to unstiff me . I have done it so much and tested many ways I have it down to a science and have helped others who went to him better than he could and did not hurt them .If you have stiff joints this is a great item to help you stop the pain . I hated how pills made me sick and it was easier to deal with pain than throw up . Be real easy and learn how it works for you as I have used it all over with testing in various stages in the range of motion I can move and been very glad I bought it
