review/text: I bought this because of glowing reviews and supposedly the lack of bad chemicals. Everyone kept touting the flavor so imagine my surprise when i had to gag to get it down. This stuff is foul plain and simple. The chocolate is slightly more palatable but not by much. I finally mixed i with another powder brand to cover up the gross taste. Its simply not palatable. Disgusting to say the least! I have a tin staring at me i fear...
