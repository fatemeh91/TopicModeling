review/text: This is a very high quality pediatric stethoscope. I use this every day at work and can compare it to other stethoscopes I have owned, including the "gold standard" Littmann pediatric stethoscope. The Adscope stethoscope provides the same high quality acoustic properties as the Littmann stethoscope and is very close to the same level of product quality for less than half the price. Is a true bargain and is now my standard stethoscope.
