review/text: This is by far the worst deodorant I've ever used. It doesn't stop BO and only adds the smell of cheap Mexican laundry detergent to the mix. Yuck! It's so bad I stopped using it before I even found a replacement. I ordered it because the UNSCENTED variety of this brand I used for years and loved is apparently no longer available. I figured the Aloe scented one couldn't be too bad. WRONG! Too late now for a refund so the two I bought are headed for Goodwill or a landfill... :(
