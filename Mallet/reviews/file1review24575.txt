review/text: I just started taking these 4 days ago. The first day I was excited to try them right after I bought them and I took 2 around 7pm. BAD idea. I was up all night with the feeling I was about to have a heart attack. My heart was beating so fast and hard I could barely breathe, let alone get any sleep so I was wrecked the next day at work..the jittery nervous feeling lasted all day. The following day I reduced it to one pill when I first woke up followed by lots of water and green tea (water alone tastes...boring). Much better. I didnt feel jittery, but energetic. Imagine the same feeling as drinking a 5 hour energy but it lasting almost all day. I didnt feel hungry at all but I ate something small for lunch and dinner anyway to keep my body healthy. I took one more this morning and feel fine so far. They do make you rather gassy though, be warned. I havent noticed any weight loss yet but I havent been hungry so Im sure in time Ill lose weight, its only been 4 days. If you try this...DONT take it at night because you wont sleep. Definately drink enough or else your stomach will cramp and start off with only one pill, I strong recommend that.
