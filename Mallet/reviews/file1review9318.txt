review/text: I purchased this because I have lots of medicine to take every day. This is great. I set this up once a week and my pills are ready. It's very roomy for even the big pills. When I go out of town, I just grab the days I need and not a whole week's worth of meds. It's great. My only problem was when it arrived, one tip of one container was broken (I guess during shipping), which makes me have to open it with my fingernails, but I love it so much, I couldn't send it back even for replacement. I'm not traveling with my container of meds any longer!
