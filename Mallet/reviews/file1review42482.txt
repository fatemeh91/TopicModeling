review/text: Shipping was quick arrived before the estimated date.Followed the directions added 1 level scoop to 5-6 ounces of water, turned on the blender, when it was done lifted up the lid and WOW what a smell. This stuff stinks. The smell was so overpowering I couldn't drink the shake. I was fighting to keep vomit down.
