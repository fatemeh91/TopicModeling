review/text: I bought a steamer and both the Micro Fiber Miracle Cloth and the ShamWow to help clean the fireplace, stove, microwave and fridge. While ShamWow may be great for absorbing spills, the Micro Fiber Miracle Cloth was superior for cleaning. I first steamed the dirt to loosen it, then followed up with the ShamWow first, then the Micro Fiber Miracle Cloth. The ShamWow did ok, but the Micro Fiber Miracle Cloth seemed to pick up soot, cooked on food, and refrigerator gunk easily- all without chemicals! The Micro Fiber Miracle Cloth is fantastic!
