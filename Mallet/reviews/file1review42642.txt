review/text: I bought my previous &#34;buddy&#34; at a pleasure party. It lasted 4 years, but recently the wires came loose and I had to buy a replacement. I looked online and found this. The website stated this was a very powerful vibrator. I was actually a little let down. It has many settings, which is nice, but none of them are as strong as the one I had before. It does the trick, but I wish it was stronger. Also, the cord on this one is shorter. I could really use another 4 inches. All in all, it is a great toy, but it's not perfect.
