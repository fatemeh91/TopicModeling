review/text: This product came as described and in a reasonable amount of time. I have not used it long enough to know if it works for me, but it appears to be a good quality product.Fenugreek naturally has a strong maple syrup odor, but I think the alcohol in this extract makes the smell even stronger. And the alcohol makes it taste bad. In the future I plan to order Fenugreek extract that is mixed with water instead of alcohol.
