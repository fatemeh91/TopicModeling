review/text: I chose the Mint Chocolate Flavor and it was fantastic. I was a little nervous it may taste a little like toothpaste. However, I was pleasantly surprised that it tastes more in line with a chocolate milk shake with a hint of very pleasant mint. When mixed with Rice or Almond milk it's fantastic. I drink a shake in the middle of the night to preserve a protein levels and use plain water and a shaker cup (because who feels like getting out of bed at 2a.m.) and the product taste very similar to YOO-HOO with the water base. Buy it- it's great stuff!
