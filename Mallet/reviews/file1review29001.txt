review/text: My favorite feature in the cruZer is the adjustable beard trimmer. Just set it to one of 4 preset lengths and trim away - no need to worry about an uneven beard or trimming off more than you wanted. The cruZer also does a great job with basic shaving, and the fact that you can rinse it off under the faucet is a real time-saver. The only downside is that you're supposed to drain the battery completely before each recharge (to maximize battery life), so you sometimes have to plug in the shaver mid-shave.
