review/text: Method daily shower spray works really well and keeps my tiled shower walls squeaky clean until I clean the shower by hand on the weekends. It doesn't leave spots or residue and seems to fight some of the pink tint that hard water leaves on my white grout lines. The only thing I don't like about the Method shower spray is that it has a fairly heavy floral scent. I would prefer something lightly scented, or unscented.All in all...a great price on a great product.
