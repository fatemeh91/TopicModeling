review/text: I love this product... it is the BEST chapstick I have ever used! Unfortunately, AVEDA has discontinued it. It is/was only $8.00 in their stores. To see it for sale for $36 is absurd! Take your chances and try finding it still in stock in an actual AVEDA store if you really need this. Otherwise, they now sell the the Lip Replenishment for $14 which supposedly replaced it... Good Luck!
