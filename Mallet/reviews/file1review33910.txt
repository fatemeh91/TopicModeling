review/text: When mobility limitations require assistance, it doesn't always have to be a dull addition. This was a gift for someone who already had a stainless steel version and now it's become a wardrobe enhancement. There is an entire line of colors and designs that turn a necessity into a bit of fun. Nice gift for someone who needs a little color in her or his life.
