review/text: My brother was the first one to inform me of using oregano oil to help fight off colds. And my sister recommended I also try olive leaf extract for the same purpose.Prior to using these products, I would get about 2-3 colds a year for as long as I can remember. The first symptom would be general fatigue, followed by a sore throat, a runny and/or stuffy nose, then coughing and congestion. The mild symptoms would last about 1.5 weeks, but unfortunately sometimes the congestion would linger for weeks.Then I started taking the oregano oil and olive leaf extract. What I've discovered over the past 5 years is this. If I start taking these herbal supplements when I start getting a sore throat, then usually I never get any chest congestion. In addition, any symptoms I do have are generally milder. So for the past 5 years, I've only had 3 serious colds, and one of those was linked to allergies (I live in Central Texas, and cedar allergies are common, although I'm not usually severely affected by them). Prior to taking these herbal supplements, I would have averaged about 10 colds in a 5 year time span.To achieve my results, I take 1 oregano pill and 1 olive leaf pill with every meal, 3 times daily, as soon as I detect the initial symptoms (usually for me it is a sore throat). I continue this intake for about 5 days, which is usually when the soreness in my throat subsides.Overall, I'm SERIOUSLY pleased with my results. Whereas over-the-counter medicines might make you feel better, they do nothing to actually combat the virus itself (they just might make your nose less stuffier, or abate your headache). Based on my personal experience, I feel like whatever compounds are in these herbs do actually assist your body in fighting the viruses.
