review/text: This is a great whey protein product, but it doesn't have much flavor. If you want something that doesn't taste like much, then this is the product for you, but if you want something that can be an enjoyable drink everyday, then definitely get the chocolate flavor. I ordered the chocolate first and really liked it, but then I ordered the vanilla ice cream to try something different, and I don't really care for it. Chocolate was "whey" better!!!!
