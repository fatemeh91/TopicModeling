review/text: I purchased the 3 pack and used them one day after another. The first time I got an evaporation line, the second one, I received a dark, very thin, blue positive line right away, and the third was a faint line within the 10 minute timing window. During the time of these Clearblue test, I was also using some of the wondfo and a dollar store test and they all came up negative. I read many many reviews stating how clearblue has a lot of false positives. So disappointing and a waste of money, not to mention heartbreak.My opinion is...go get a First Response or a dollar store test. I gave it one star only because that is the minimum you can put.
