review/text: I really liked this product. It's really unscented. Lots of times ""unscented"" products have a scent, but this one has barely any. It goes on really smoothly, and leaves no residue. It appeared to work fine, comparable to other anti-perspirants and deodorants I've used. All in all, it seemed to be a good product, and I'll probably buy it if it goes on sale.
