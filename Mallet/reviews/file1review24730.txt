review/text: I have owned one for 15+ years and have found this unit to be excellent. Better than competitive products I have used over previous 15 years. The brass nozzles are what makes this product so great, despite its plastic body (to keep it price sensitive). However, A couple of cautionary notes:1. The nozzles do get clogged with dirt. I cleaned mine annually in the spring with an ordinary pin2. Except for the watering arm and nozzles, it IS of plastic. So yo gotta treat this with care. Do not drag this with the watering hose as it puts pressure on the hose fitting. The hose fitting is "glued on" to the direction control mechanism, as I found out. My sprinkler FINALLY got caught while I was dragging it (being lazy) and a couple of tugs on the hose broke it.I am replacing the broken unit with another one (Unfortuntaely the price has gone up, but I'd rather deal with a reliable product)Good luck!!
