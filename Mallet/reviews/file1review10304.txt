review/text: I thought this was a great deal for Energizer AA Batteries, buy a 16 pack of AA for $12.32 ($.77 each) until I found Rayovac 48 pack for $25.30 ($.53 each). They also come in reclose able package so after you open the pack they do not role around in your drawer. My boyfriend uses Rayovac UltraPro at work, bought them at a contractor supply store.One of my students did a battery test and found all of them work the same. Comes down to price. Sign up for "subscribe and save" and get 15% off too. Because these are $25.40 you get Free Freight at Amazon without having to shop for more to hit the minimum.Here is the product link.Rayovac ALAA-48 UltraPRO Alkaline AA Batteries, 48-Pack
