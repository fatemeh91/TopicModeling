review/text: While struggling with infertility my dr put me on Clomid and had me to buy a ovulation predictor kit. I bought one of the more expensive test and had a really hard time reading the results. I then bought the cheaper Answer test and when it would show positive my dr would have me come in that next morning for Artificial Insemination. Each time the dr would do a vaginal ultrasound to be sure there were actually folicals there. The answer test always proved to be accurate. Infertility treatments didnt work and we took a break from the dr for a while but continued to use the Answer test on our own. I ended up concieving 4 different times using this test. All though the first 3 pregnancies ended in miscarriage we were finally blessed with a baby girl after struggling with infertility for 17 years. I highly recommend this test and should we decide to have another baby (we are 39 years old now)we wont hesitate to rely on this OPK.
