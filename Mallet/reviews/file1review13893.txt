review/text: This is one of the best pill dispensers I have used. It's simple, to the point, and gets the job done. It's also reasonably durable so it will last for some time. Many of the plastic dispensers I have used in the past will warp at the tip after awhile so the pill will fall out before you're ready to "shoot". This one, so far, has not and I have been using it for several years now. That said, the ease of use still depends on your cat. I have 6 cats. Pill dispensing is a quick, easy, 1-person job on the 2 mellow cats. I also, however, have a Kitty Cujo with mad ninja skills who makes any job a 2-person job (or possibly a mob job) no matter what you are trying to do. Alas, I have only me but, with a bit of patience, skill, and subterfuge I am still able to get the pill into her with the use of this little item. The trick is to try and get the tip of the dispenser far enough into the cat's mouth so that the pill shoots onto the back of the tongue and the cat will usually swallow it involuntarily. Except, of course, when they don't. Then they spit the pill out at you and you are left with experience and the chance to try it all over again. Believe me, though, it is easier than trying to do the same type of maneuver with your fingers which is what my vet told me to do. With patience and practice, it does get easier. I am a pill gun sharpshooter at this point. And I still have all my fingers.
