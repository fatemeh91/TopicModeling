review/text: I have tried MANY different brands and flavors of lo-carb shakes over my 2 decades of weight lifting and this is the best tasting one by far. Usually I don't expect much in way of taste for lo-carb protein shakes. This one blends well and tastes great. I usually blend it in the Bullet, with crushed ice, 1/2 banana (or frozen organic mixed berries) and 1 1/2 scoops of this whey powder. It's like a treat after working out...or for a pre breakfast snack.
