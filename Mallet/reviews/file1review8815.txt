review/text: Though I am not a nutrition expert I can say that I have been testing and trying several green mixes over the past years. I use green Vibrance now for more than three years and everyone I recommended this one is more than happy. All ingredients make absolute sense and I can feel the benefits that are mentioned all over. A great addition to the daily food intake in my opinion. well the less yummy taste I overcome buy drinking it with orange juice.
