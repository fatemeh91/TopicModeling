review/text: When you first try them you may not think they're for you because their flavor is not that sweet or sugary in taste. Its a little 'drier', but if you buy a couple at your local health food store they will most likely grow on you.They are a great snack! A great early morning snack if you don't have time or make time for a full breakfast. They give you the boost and energy you need to start your day off right. And it sustains you. It doesn't let you crash and burn like sugar or caffeine which I really like.
