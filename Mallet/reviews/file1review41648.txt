review/text: I own this toothbrush and think it is the best toothbrush on the market, well worth the money. I drink a lot of coffee and tea - both stain your teeth - upon recommendation of my dentist I purchased this toothbrush after my last cleaning and to my amazement I have managed to keep the stains off my teeth. My gums were a little sore at first, but they have adjusted to the brush and now I have a beautiful smile, stain free!!! I have owned many electric toothbrushes but this is the best, hands down.Connie - Sanford, NC
