review/text: This mirror is large, light, and distortion free - and the stand idea works. But as for the lighting...it was downright laughable! It is two tiny dim flashlight spots. It doesn't light the mirror surface AT ALL. This would possibly get 3 stars from anyone just wanting it for a magnifying mirror, if it didn't claim that it was a lighted mirror. It is NOT a lighted mirror- it is a mirror with a lighted handle!
