review/text: I've had many Braun toothbrushes over the years replacing them usually because the battery no longer holds a charge after a few years or, less often, because I cannot find replacement toothbrushes for the model. Each time I get a replacement there are improvements that make me wish I had gotten a newer model sooner. This model has been the best model by far. It really massages my gums and my teeth feel really smooth like they do after I've had them cleaned at the dentist.The battery lasts quite a while when travelling and I like how you can strip down the charger to just the cord and a minimal base for longer trips. The plastic travel container is also a nice plus although it could be more compact if you did not have to remove the toothbrush to get it to fit and place the toothbrush in a separate slot in the container (it has room for 2 brushes).The LCD on the handle showing the time is not useful because you cannot see it while you're brushing but the 30 second signal is useful to make it easier to brush each of your quadrants about the same amount of time. The LCD does show residual battery power which helps figure out how long you could travel without recharging.My dentist recommended the smaller head to make it easier to get the back molars. I recommend this device to anyone who loves the feeling of clean teeth.
