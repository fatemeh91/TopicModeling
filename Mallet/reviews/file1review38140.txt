review/text: This product was great considering I have a small child who keeps touching my glasses and putting little fingerprints over them. However they're only alcohol on a wipe. So for the price it would be cheaper to just clean you glasses with a little alcohol. These are great to keep in the car for quick cleaning of your glasses, though, and I will put some in the car for future use. I think I'd recommend it only to my father because he travels a lot and would love the convenience of them. Great product, just easier and cheaper to buy a bottle of alcohol and clean with that.
