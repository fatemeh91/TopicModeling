review/text: My husband bought me this stethoscope after hearing me complain a lot about having to use the "cheap charlies" at work, or having to hunt down a stethoscope. I work in a military family practice so we see a lot of patients that need BP checks on a regular basis. This is a great stethscope. Not the best but it gets the job done. The red heart design is a great conversation starter and helps me keep track of it without someone "wandering" off with it.
