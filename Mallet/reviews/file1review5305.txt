review/text: Okay, I know this review might seem a bit premature, since I only received this product yesterday, but WOW! I am 6 1/2 weeks pregnant and have been having horrible, all-day morning sickness for about a week. The minute I received these yesterday afternoon, I popped one in my mouth, and by the time I had finished sucking on it my nausea was 100 times better! Last night I was actually able to eat a real meal! This morning, I popped one in as soon as I woke up, and was able to eat a real warm breakfast (my nausea has been so bad I have seriously been limited to saltines and plain bread). I know every pregnancy is different, but if you are suffering from nausea and vomiting like I was, you owe it to yourself to give these a try!
