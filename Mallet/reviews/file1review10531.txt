review/text: I purchased this quad cane in the black color for my mom. The price was right, has sturdy construction, and the color purchased was perfect because it blends in well without being very noticeable. It does have a large sticker on the front that needs to be removed, but it came off quickly with WD40! It gave my mom a little extra security walking heading into winter. Great buy.
