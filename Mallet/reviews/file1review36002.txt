review/text: I have read some of the reviews about people complaining about how bad it tastes. I have found that if you drink it in the form of a shake with milk and some fruit in the morning it tastes better. In a blender i mix it with milk,a banana,frozen fruit,and yogurt and the taste is very good. It gives me plenty of energy throughout the day.
