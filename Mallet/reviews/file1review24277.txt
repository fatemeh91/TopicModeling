review/text: I tell everyone I talk to who has sciatic nerve problem or metatarcil problems that these orthotics are incredible, and much, much better than the ones I paid $500 for at the Good Feet store. I had an orthopedic doctor who was going to cut the nerve between my toes to eliminate my excruciating pain, but luckily I tried these first. I have very high arches and they weren't getting enough support. Anyway, yes, I do take all the inner soles and arch supports out of every shoe I buy and I put another flat rubbery sole on top of the walk-fits and I walk in heaven. I can carry my grand kids, and heavy groceries up my steps without pain. Spent a fortune on Dr. Scholles and it was all a waste of money.
