review/text: I love this product for the use of vacuuming cat litter around the cat box and vicinity and small vacuuming jobs that do not require the use of the regular vaccum cleaner but I am finding that after a year I have bought about 4 of these because every 3-4 months the thing dies! So when it is working, it is a great product to use but I am disappointed that it dies after only 3-4 months of use!
