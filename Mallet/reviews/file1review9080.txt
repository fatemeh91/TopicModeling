review/text: I was pleasantly surprised and at the same time pleased to see Green Vibrance, a product that I have been using for quite some time, being featured on such a great show. Rosie Odonell, swears by its benefits, and even had Dr. Oz drink a Green Vibrance shake on his show with her. It was cute to see them do the hand embrace thing as they drank the shake together. I will continue to use it, and I loved the feature.
