review/text: Not as painful as I thought it would be on the legs, just some slight prickling, like little pins, you can definitely tell it's working. I thought with this having two heads I wouldn't have to go over the same area again and again, but I do, this is a major drawback. Horrible for the bikini line, don't even think about it, the pain goes from feeling like little prickles to feeling like great tufts of hair are being pulled out at once, when it's really only getting a few; it also seemed to skip over my skin and pinch me as well, and we all know you don't want to be pinched there. Overall: Recommended for legs and large areas where skin is taut and easily accessible, do NOT buy this product in hopes of using it on your bikini line- Buy the Braun Silk Epil Xelle for that instead.
