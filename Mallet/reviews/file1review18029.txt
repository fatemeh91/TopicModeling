review/text: The mask works perfectly. Really blocks out light. The strap is pretty comfortable and the mask feels good on the face.The best part is the mask doesn't touch your eyes if that kinda thing freaks you out.The worst part is it looks like a padded bra for your head... if that kinda thing freaks you out. If your into that kind of thing thats good for you... but you freak me out.
