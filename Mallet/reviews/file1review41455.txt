review/text: I took this product for several months in the hopes of containing my hot flashes which were more like *melt downs*. My doctor told me to buy myself a good fan as that was about all that could help he. HRT is not an option for me.At first, the product seems to help, then after about 3-4 months, the effectiveness seemed to wear off. I stopped taking it and then about 8 months later tried again. Same thing - it worked for a while then didn't seem to work anymore. So it's possible the effect was psychosomatic and just seemed to work, or it actually did work, and then indeed, quit working.I gave it 4 stars as it did seem to help at first, there were no adverse side effects and it may help someone else even though I have quit taking it. Everyone is so different that just because it didn't continue to help me doesn't mean it won't help someone else. So it's probably worth at least trying it.
