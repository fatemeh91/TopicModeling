review/text: The box dispenser needs work. Or else the perforations need to be deeper between each square so that they break free more easily when pulled. Invariably I have a wrench or a greasy part in one hand, and have to wrestle with the box to pull out a single paper with the other hand. I will keep them, use them up, and probably order again, but may put an old starter motor on the box so it will stay put while I snap a towel out of there.
