review/text: I have had stomach distress for decades. I've tried every pharmaceutical remedy, antacid remedy, wives tail remedy I came across. When I realized enzymes were not yet tried, I bought these Omega-Zyme enzymes. They have provided me with a level of relief that I never even imagined possible. I had fairly regular bouts of stomach distress that would last all day (or sometimes several days). The distress would affect my vagus nerve and impact my heart rhythm. It was maddening. These enzymes have all but eliminated my decade's long struggle. I came to realize that, for them to work, I have to take them religiously whenever I eat almost anything throughout the day. If I do that, I am 90% trouble free. It is not a coincidental relief. When I don't take them, I can almost be certain of distress. When I take them each time I eat, almost no distress. My experience is that the standard (non Ultra) form is just as effective as the more costly "Ultra". The "Ultra" is a capsule with powder in the capsule and the standard strength is a hard caplet. The Ultra version is consistently of poor quality control relative to amount of powder in the capsules. Some of the capsules are firm and full and others have very little in the capsules. I like that the standard hard caplet version is consistent from pill to pill. This is a great product. I could not be without them now that I have been relieved of the majority of my many, many years of stomach distress. I have tried other enzymes, but these are so consistently helpful I no longer look for anything less costly. These work for me and I would pay more if I had to for the relief they provide.A final comment for those that are highly lactose intolerant. There is not enough lactase in it to cover those that are significantly intolerant. I suggest keeping a lactaid type supplement around for those that may need an additional measure of lactose protection.
