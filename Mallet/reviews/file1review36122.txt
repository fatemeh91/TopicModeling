review/text: This vibe is okay, it has it's pros and cons. The lowest setting is a light hum that you can't really hear, when you turn it to full power, it was a light buzzing sound, which I find annoying. Turning up the tv or music helped me on that part. The tip was useful on circling body parts, it reached some places inside with just the tip and that worked really well for me. The vibrations could be stronger for my taste, but it is still a good product for this price. Only thing is that I found silcone a bit sticky...I kinda expected that but I had to have a lot of moisture or use a lot of lube to make it slide and glide. Other than those few things, this product is great. Great to hold for me and the slight bumps or ridges made it fun to slide in and feel them. Also note that if your holding onto it, you might get stronger vibrations in your hand so I either use something to hold it on against my clit or get it inside of me or clench my thighs which transfer vibrations into my inner thighs which aren't that bad sometimes.Edit: 3 months later...it doesn't really work. It kinda turns on when you have it on the highest setting, but before you can come, it shuts off after a minute of turning it on. I changed batteries, but no use...threw it into the closest for now, but it was worth it while it lasted. The price wasn't bad and the sensations were nice.
