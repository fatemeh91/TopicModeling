review/text: I bought this for my almost 2 yr old daughter who is just recently potty trained. She loves this seat and has to push elmos hands a couple times every time she uses it. The only thing I dont care for is that you have to remove the white seat to dump the potty, but on a positive note compared to other seats i've had my 2 yr old cant remove it herself this way she wont make a mess trying to empty the potty herself and its not hard to remove or place back! When she sits on it her leg presses elmos hand so he sounds off till she is done, but she loves it! The potty container is not to small like other seats either, its got a good size to it.
