review/text: Last year I had to begin the hunt for a new beard trimmer...and man are there a lot out there and half of them wanted over $100 for something so simple. This trimmer is a great price (even if it didn't have the Amazon discount!) and does its job well. I've had it for over a year at this point and I've never had any issues with it. It recharges quickly, cuts cleanly, and is dead simple to use.
