review/text: I am second degree black belt in Taekwondo, 60 years young and my knees take a beating. I have been taking this product for the last 8 months. I started right after my first athroscopic knee surgery, for stage 2 osteoarthritis and torn miniscus, and it works. When I showed this product to my orthopaedic surgeon, he said it was what I needed to take for the rest of my life. He takes the same product! After a second surgery for another tear, I was able to return to Taekwondo within weeks. I will continue learning and teaching until I have be carried out, but I won't stop taking Triple Flex.
