review/text: I've had a serious problem with hemorrhoids -- to the point of even having emergency surgery at one point -- and I have NEVER found anything that helps as much as this stuff. It *instantly* soothes and relieves the pain, unlike anything else I've tried. It literally feels like putting an ice-cube on the affected area -- immediately cools it down. Great stuff!!!
