review/text: I had a Hemorrhoid about 4 months ago. It was awful and very painful. I went to the doctor and he prescribed some suppositories which frankly didn't do anything. I read somewhere about this product and decided to buy it. In addition to using this 2 times a day, I also sat in the bathtub for about 10 minutes every day and right after the bath i would put a cube of ice on the hemorrhoid for 10 minutes. With the combination of these activities, the hemorrhoid shrunk after a few weeks and was completely gone within a couple of months (my hemorrhoid took forever to go away for some reason). There is still a tiny flap of skin where the hemorrhoid used to be, but it is shrinking away i think. This cream does have a nasty smell, but it is better than having a nasty hemorrhoid lol. p.s. stay away from Fiber One bars - they give you super bad gas rofl. Eat real food with real fiber (fruit / veggies / whole grains) and you shouldn't get any more hemorrhoids.
