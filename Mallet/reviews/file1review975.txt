review/text: Bought this as a lower-cost alternative to Futuro's "Infinity" knee support (see my review of that). This is reasonably supportive, does the job I need it for, smaller (so it works better under clothes, etc) but less comfortable than the "Infinity". Not as good kneecap stabilization, either. I use this for shorter and less vigorous workouts and sometimes normal day-to-day activities; bends more easily than the larger support so more comfortable to sit. Pretty much stays in place (if you measure and get the right size...). Box says "hand wash" but I use washer/dryer cold/low and it seems fine. Latex rubber so those allergic need to beware.
