review/text: The item itself is great. The postage sucks. It cost $50.00 for an order that cost $100.00. The weight of the item could not have cost more than $15.00. It was also send to me by Priority mail which I did not want.In the future, I believe I will shop at regular stores, pay taxes and not be paying to put lots of extra money in someone's pocket.All I know is that a 1, 1 1/2 pound item does not cost $50.00 to mail!
