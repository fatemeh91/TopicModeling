review/text: If all you want is a cheap sprinkler for the kids to run through, this is a pretty good bargain -- if you get it for $10 or less. If you want a sprinkler that you can adjust to hit a certain area, this ain't it! The markings on the dial are fairly cryptic, plus there's no clear identification of what each icon is supposed to line up with. There are no instructions on or in the box, or online. I thought I could figure it out with a little experimentation, but there doesn't seem to be a lot of finesse to the system.Like I said, keep looking.
