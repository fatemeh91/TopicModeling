review/text: I've been using ON products for a little over a year now. For the most part, I've been very pleased. I bought the 10 lb bag back in November because at the time, it was cheaper than the 5 lb tub. Tastes the same but as far as usign it in my shaker cup, this has been very clumpy. Tried some Syntha-6 a month ago and not once did it clump and it tastes much better. Maybe it was a fluke thing with the clumping, but this will be the last ON product I purchase for a long time.
