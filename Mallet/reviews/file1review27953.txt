review/text: 24g of protein per scoop and thats not counting the milk. I had it for over 2 months and I haven't gotten tired of the taste; in fact, its pretty damn good. There's no need to add anything to it to make it taste tolerable, it really does taste great. I use vanilla soy milk and a couple of ice cubes and mix it with a blender. Perfect every time.
