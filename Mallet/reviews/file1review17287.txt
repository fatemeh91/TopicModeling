review/text: I had been using a Schick Quatro razor with a trimmer on the back, and it had many disadvantages, including a poor battery life, the hair getting caught, and not a good cutter in general. Plus it took a long time to trim. So I was looking around for a beard trimmer, and I saw this one. I read the reviews of others, and it was a good price, so I figured I'd give it a try. The first time I used it, I was truly amazed. The trimmer is nice and quick. The blades don't need to be oiled which is really cool. I liked how the trimmer has nine adjustable settings, and the #1 setting cuts the hair really short. I'd recommend using the #3 or #4 for a nice short cut. And at $30 (this was the price at the time I purchased it), it was a great deal. If you're looking for a good trimmer that doesn't need to be oiled and is a quick and easy and clean way to trim a beard, this is the trimmer for you.
