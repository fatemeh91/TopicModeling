review/text: In Japan, Amino Vital Pro is about three times as expensive, so I got this from the USA. The ingredients are stated as the same, yet the flavour is completely different. Furthermore, the Japanese one really seems to have an effect when I work out, whereas this one does not. It might have some electrolytic effect, but it seems to be a different product despite the recipe being the same.
