review/text: Over the summer I developed a 4th metatarsal stress fracture after running too much. It was reaggravated twice over nearly 3 months @ 3 weeks in and @ 2 months in despite resting and RICEing it. A friend's mom recommended Symphytum Officinale after her son used it to help with a bone break. Since staying off of my foot was not enough, I desperately decided to try this along with USP Labs Super Cissus Rx, which I read also aids bone healing. I used an order of each and continued to take it easy for an additional month. Once I finished both bottles, I slowly began increasing my activity. I ran my first mile roughly 6 months post fracture and can now run 3 miles regularly with no signs of reaggravation. It might have been the sheer amount of time I rested for, but I think this along with Cissus Quadrangularis is definitely worth a try considering how debilitating and unpredictable stress fractures can be. These taste fine/good btw.
