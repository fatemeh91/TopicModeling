review/text: I'm surprised by how well this is rated so I decided to add my two cents to the minority.The PROS: Fits snugly on any seat. We have round and elongated and it fits both no problem. Also, easy to clean. I also like the look of it; simple and clean. I put one in the guest bathroom and I can leave it there when I have people over.The CONS: By the time you get the seat cover up, the pants down, the seat on and plop you kid on the toilet he's already pee'd hisself.The slashguard - after watching my sons try to get up from it on there own I quickly realized they might end up eunuchs. Even with the stool and me standing there it is still dangerous; they have to be lifted. When they try to maneuver around it, the seat becomes dislodged from putting there weight on one side. I was horrified to hear that some boys actually pulled their skin open and needed stitches. I was even more appalled by some reviewers saying that the parents should have been more vigilant. With all the worry and guilt inherant in parenting thats just a mean thing to say; and not trure. The whole point of potty training is to get your child to go on their own. They can't learn if you are hovering every time.I bought the built in toilet seat instead. There are two seats in one so both children and adults can use it.
