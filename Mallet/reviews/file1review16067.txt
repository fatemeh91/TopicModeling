review/text: Incredible stuff! I used Herbal Ed's Salve on a sore that I got while traveling and had had for two months. As soon as I used this salve my sore began to disappear and it was clear within four days. I bought this salve because it was the only one I could find that contained propolis, which is a natural anti-biotic from bees. I am taking Herbal Ed's Salve whenever I travel as it is a perfect size and catch-all remedy!
