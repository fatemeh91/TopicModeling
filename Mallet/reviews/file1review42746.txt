review/text: My Braun recently died on me after serving me well for a number of years. My wife went out and bought the Remington and while I have no qualms about the shave itself (it does a decent job) the battery life is downright horrible. Does not hold a charge for very long and the most disappointing thing is that there is no visual indicator that it is low on charge nor can you shave while it is plugged in! Going back to Braun. You pay more but I find you get what you pay for.
