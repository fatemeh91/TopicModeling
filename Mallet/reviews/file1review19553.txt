review/text: Don't waste your money on any other trainer seat! The Baby Bjorn seat is the most comfortable for your little one, and a breeze to clean. I bought other seats (four bathrooms in our house) and ended up throwing them all away. This one is probably the most expensive, but its worth it when you are trying to teach a VERY important skill!!!
