review/text: I had a large wart on the palm of my hand that was bothering me. I purchased two items from amazon.com: this wart stick and dr. scholl's product.I tried Dr. Scholls first and was very disapointed. The medicated pad fell off easily and the bandaids didnt stay on my hand for more then an hour.So I started applying the wart stick on a daily basis and the results are astounding. It dried it up so fast. The package says to put a bandaid over it but because of the awkward place it was in, I didn't bother with the bandaid and it worked just fine like that.
