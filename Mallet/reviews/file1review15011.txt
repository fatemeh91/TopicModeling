review/text: I saw bladderwrack listed in the blood type diet book for Type O and have been taking it for years ever since then. I haven't noticed any weight loss (like some of the other reviewers) but I've got a small frame and don't really need that. What I do need it for is to keep my PMS symptoms at bay. Whenever I stop taking it I get a killer 2-day headache related to my menstrual cycle.I've tried other brands over the years but this one seems to work the best. The Eclectic Institute bladderwrack seems to be getting harder to find in the stores (and it never did seem like a common item in health food stores). So glad Amazon carries it.
