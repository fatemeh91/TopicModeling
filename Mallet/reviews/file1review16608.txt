review/text: i do find the felt a bit harder to lift up to fill than my other zippo, but its not a big deal. also, the finish is very scratched looking, makes it look more used, i like it, doesnt show wear and tear as much. for thhose of you who dont like it its a zippo, know what your getting, the method of it goes back for like 80 years, its how lighters all used to be. also, changing the wick in this piece is really flippin annoying
