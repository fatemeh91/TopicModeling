review/text: Ive tried different brands and flavors but nothing comes close to this. I've gone through 4 of the 5lb tubs already and will stick to this flavor.It dissolves easily in cold water. You can use a wand mixer for a thorough mix, but most of the time its not needed.Other brands tastes like chalk to me, so if you like the flavor of mocha, this one won't disappoint.
