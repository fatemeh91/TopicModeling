review/text: I purchased this foot bath based on the apparent depth of the water and the other reviews of people that had already used it. It fully meets my expectations. In addition to the usable depth, it also has a heater that actually heats the water. Other foot baths that I have used have very wimpy heaters or none at all. Of course, it gets pretty heavy. One should consider using it near where they plan to dump out the water.
