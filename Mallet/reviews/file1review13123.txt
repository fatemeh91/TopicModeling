review/text: It's not exactly how it looks in the picture. There are no "ears" that come up to the jaw and it's flatter. But does it work you ask? Well, I bought it for a hot pack and it does get plenty hot in the micro and it holds some heat for a half hour or so. And it's weighty so it lays flat against the back of your neck and spine. But the velcro closure in the front gets pretty hot so I don't close it unless it's cooled some. It's nice that you can wear it while you move around without it falling off. I think it's better than anything else I have. Haven't tried it as a cold pack because I already have some very good alternatives. I would recommend it. It's better than a neck buddy that smells like an old sock. There's no odor with this one!
