review/text: First off as a block oil, thuis works very well. Does exactly what it is supposed to do. Smell is pleasant, protects the wood well.However the ants go crazy for this stuff. I have an ant problem as it is but whenever I oil my boards or blocks the next day andfor about a week it is covered in ants. At first i thought it was a coincidence. Now that i have used it several times the ant thingis consistent. The amazing thing is that I searched the internet and there was nothing about ants being especially attracted tolemon oil, but there must be another ingredient in there that is attracting it. Unfortunately i will be throwing out a half used bottlebecause I cannot deal with it anymore
