review/text: I have lactose intolerance and find myself getting uncomfortable with alot of Whey protein powders I've tried before. Not with this one.It also easily dissolves in cold water, which I like. I don't even use a mixer, most of the time I bring a coffee sipper and swish it around there. I love the taste of chocolate mint with cold water, it's very refreshing after a workout.
