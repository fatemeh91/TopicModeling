review/text: This product works for me. I believe it could help you too. I work on my feet long hours and have used inserts for 15 years.It takes time to get used to them so follow the instruction. Four stars because I have used other inserts and I think they all do the same thing,(though the height adjustments are pretty good and others don't have them.) Look for a good price.
