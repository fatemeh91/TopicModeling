review/text: In 2006, I bought a dozen of the Gerber flat diapers. I liked them. They were a good weave, strong twist cotton. However, I went back to purchase more later and was sadly disappointed. The company had changed the fabric, weave, and how they were made. The old ones had a woven selvage and were serged on the ends with a soft thread. The new ones were serged all around, and used a different thread that was not soft. I returned the new ones, and wore out my old ones. A couple of times a year I open a package in the store to see if they are any different, but have not seen any positive changes.For anyone who wants to use them as rags or light towels, they may be just fine, but for diapers, they are nothing compared to the older ones.I also tried the prefolds with the "absorbent" middle. I finally cut one open after finding they would not hold even one ounce of liquid (lay diaper in colander, over a large bowl, pour one ounce water onto diaper, then measure what falls into the bowl) and discovered that they are filled with polyester batting. The batting makes them soft and puffy, but polyester does not absorb liquid.If you want flat diapers, look online for Indian or Chinese flats, or, maybe even something made in the USA! Same with prefolds. Gerber makes good pins and nice baby clothes, but don't waste time and money on their cloth diapers.
