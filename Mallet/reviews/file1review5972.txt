review/text: This is a great gadget and I feel that the results are pretty accurate. I have found that you really need to position this in just the right spot on your wrist, though, as it seems like an inch higher or lower makes a big difference. I've found that placing the lower edge about where the lower edge of my watch normally sits seems to have the most accurate readings (about 1.5" from my palm).
