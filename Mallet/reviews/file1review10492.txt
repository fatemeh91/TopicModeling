review/text: The rating for the over all sonicare brush I would give is a 5, but why make it so hard to match replacement heads to the unit you have? My brush says: "PHILIPS Sonicare" and then, etched into the bottom, "061009 HX9500". With Philips changing their models every year, you would think that Philips, or even amazon would list all compatable models with their replacement heads, but they don't. Why? Do they hope we'll give up and buy a whole new unit? So who does list this info? The only people who really care about selling small amounts of items at a time:eBay sellers!Doesn't matter what you're looking for, Google your model number, what you're trying to replace, with "ebay", and then click on the first eBay link on the list.
