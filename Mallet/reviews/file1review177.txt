review/text: I started taking this because I have irregular menstrual cycles and I want to get pregnant. So far I've been taking this Solaray Vitex for 3-4 months. I'm not pregnant yet but my cycles are getting closer to what is considered normal. They used to be anywhere from 30-45 days and now I'm running more like 32-34 days. On a side note, about two years ago I bought some Vitex for PMS and it didn't seem to work. Later I found out from reading that it's the Vitex Extract that is supposed to be more effective for these feminine problems and what I had purchased before was just Vitex Fruit. I'm not sure whether or not the Solaray Vitex Extract I'm taking now is helping my PMS crabbiness but I think it is helping with my bloating.
