review/text: we've been using this stuff to keep our 7 year old asthma free for over a year now. After 4 emergency room visits in a year, I decided to take a different route for my child's health. My research pointed to the DHA as a possible help. I decided to give it a try. Never did I imagine that it was going to be a cure to her asthma. I'm a believer..never a day without it now.
