review/text: I ordered a 12 count of these razors. I've used Gillette Fusion Razors for years and always bought them at a brick and mortar store. This time, I figured I would save a little money and ordered through Amazon. The ad pictured a sealed pack of 12 razors. Well, I received my package today. Eight razors were in a sealed Gillette box and the other 4 were received unwrapped. I'm pretty OCD about personal hygiene and to me, this is kind of disgusting. I have no idea where these exposed razors have been.Seller did refund my money, although he only needed to refund me for the 4 razors. Therefore, I changed my original 3-Star Rating to 4 Stars.Thanks.
