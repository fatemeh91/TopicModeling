review/text: I like the fact that these pads are made from renewable sources and can be reused, so i bought them for ecological reasons. I was also given some of the disposables. I have to say I'm going to let go of my idealism this once because the washable pads feel very inflexible and awkward under my shirt. If you are using no bra or a bra that is not ironclad, you will be able to see the pad protruding, since for some reason it does not adjust to your breast shape as much as the disposables. I also do not like that they produce fuzz that gets glued to my nipples when they leak, which is very hard to remove without soap. Somehow I do not like the idea of my newborn eating that fuzz with his meal--even if it is cotton. Surprisingly, I also felt that the disposables felt gentler to my sore nipples than these.So far, both types have managed to hold all my leaking so I cannot comment on this. However, it feels as if the disposable absorbs the moisture better and in that regard is more comfortable as well.
