review/text: Remains flexible even when extremely cold. I suffered a whiplash injury several months ago; I wish I'd discovered this cold pack back then. Comfortable to wear, will fit a large range of neck sizes, and extends down the back a good bit farther than the other cervical cold packs I've tried.I doubt that I'll buy any brand other than Elasto-Gel from here on out.
