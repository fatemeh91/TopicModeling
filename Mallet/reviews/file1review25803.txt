review/text: I was happy to find a 3-6-9 Omega that I could take. I have had no issues. I take this with Folic Acid and B-12 every morning and have no issues other than needing to eat something or drink coffee after taking it. If I don't, it will make my stomach hurt or make me nauseous. Other than that, no issues.
