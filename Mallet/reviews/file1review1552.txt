review/text: I rarely write reviews for products, but I had to for this one. I had a wart on my pinky finger that would not go away. I tried to freeze it multiple times and tried other products. My doctor even attempted to freeze it once-it blistered but did not come off.I decided to try this product. Within a day I could tell my wart was disappearing. It was amazing! I had no bad side effects like some of the other reviewers but I was careful to only put it on the wart. I highly recommend the Wart Stick. And it's cheap! I'm going to attack my plantars warts next!
