review/text: So when I put this product on it did smell like an old lady's perfume, but I found that if you put coconut oil over the top it does reduce the smell enough that it isn't over powering. It worked throughout the whole day of stress chasing around a 2 year old in a busy farmers market and festival. After putting it on at 10:00am (2 sprays) with a layer of coconut oil over the top to easy the smell at first. By about 12:00 the old lady smell went away and emerge a lovely rose smell which is still there at 6:00pm. I do recommend it is healthy and works, a great combo.
