review/text: Though OXO is a company dedicated to making durable, high-quality products, this is not among them. Utterly unsatisfying, the Soap-Dispensing Scrub Brush wastes soap, breaks easily, and doesn't really fit into tight corners. Ours broke after only a few weeks' worth of use, mainly because the tracks onto which the brushes glide can't take the stress. Ironically, the thing that makes it easy to add new brushes is also the thing which makes the device unstable. Also, there's no way of turning off the soap dispenser; it ALWAYS flows from the reservoir.OXO, fortunately has not been content to have just one soap-dispensing product, so if you're really looking for a good all-in-one soap scrubber, check out their Soap Pump Palm Brush instead. It's far more durable and less wasteful of soap.
