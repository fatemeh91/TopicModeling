review/text: This is an excellent value for the money. I had been buying my Bromelain with 600 GDU from The Vitamin Shoppe, but they stopped carrying the capsule form. So, I turned to Amazon for help and I found this. Since I don't use prescription medications to control my GERD, Bromelain is a very important part of my regime. With the 4X increase in GDU, I experienced a noticeable improvement in how I feel. I do recommend this product. I also suggest acquiring a copy of Prescription for Nutritional Healing by Phyllis A. and James E. Balch, for further information. I can't say enough good things about this bookThe product quality met my expectations and the delivery was well within the promised time period.
