review/text: I've had other meal replacement shakes and they've all left an after-taste in my mouth. I was skeptical about purchasing this one but, with the great overall reviews, I went on and ordered the 18 packets of the new flavor (cake batter). I have to say that this is day 2 of me drinking these shakes and I LOVE LOVE LOVE the flavor and texture (not too thick, not too watery) of the shake. It keeps me full even when it's time for me to eat a snack or meal. I will definitely be trying the chocolate shakes next!
