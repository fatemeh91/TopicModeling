review/text: And "junk" is too nice a word for it. The hands free thing never worked, and the part that flips over for you to put the diaper in when you open the lid doesn't come up all the way, so I have to cram the diapers in just to use it. We've only had it a couple of months too! A pail that costs this much should work more than two months! On top of that, those little filters are a joke. This pail stinks worse than any we have owned to date. Fortunately, my son has quit wearing diapers, so we just have our daughter's to deal with, but still...this pail is NOT worth the money and we are really upset that we wasted our money on this product.
