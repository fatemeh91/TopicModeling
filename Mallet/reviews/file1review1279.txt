review/text: This foot file is pretty good. I think the handle is too flimsy though. When you begin to use the file, the handle feels like it's going to break. So instead of holding it like the picture shows, I tend to hold it maybe 1/2 way down the file itself, to ensure it doesn't break while I'm using it.
