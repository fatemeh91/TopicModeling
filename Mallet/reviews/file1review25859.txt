review/text: Amazing! I have purchased a Panasonic ES8026 (the best panas. in our country - I think it's the same, maybe the battery is another...) only yesterday and this morning I tried shaving with with a shaving gel - I never had so close shave even with my Mach 3 razor (which also left lots of bumps and cuts on my face). I had shaved with a small travel shaver before, and the difference is great. I have very sensitive skin and shaving was always a nightmare for me. But this shaver changed everything! It glides over my face very easily and leaves almost no irritation. Beautiful!
