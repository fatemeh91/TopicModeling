review/text: I have owned a Harper 118 Broom for the last 5 years and it has been so wonderful. Friends and family who have used it have always asked where I got it, wanting one for themselves. It was a gift and I never could find anywhere locally that sold Harper Brooms. We needed a new broom for our shop and another one for our basement that is finished with bamboo flooring so I began my search anew, hoping to find the elusive Harper 118.I finally decided to try this one, the 108, it's different from the 118 in that the handle is hollow aluminum instead of wood but handier in that it has a hole to hang from. The bristles and sweeping are just as spectacular as the 118 we've enjoyed for so long. I know it sounds silly to gush about a broom, but the typical brooms you find at big box stores are just absolutely AWFUL by comparison. If you want to experience a broom that does a really terrific job, give a Harper broom a shot! I even LIKE sweeping up our schoolroom and playroom now. It's wonderful, I'm buying two more so we can have one on each level of our home (we've tile and hard wood/bamboo flooring everywhere). HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
