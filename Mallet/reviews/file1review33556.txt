review/text: I started using the Waterpik a number of years ago, and once one realizes how much more it does than a toothbrush, one will never again feel that ones teeth are clean unless followed up with the Waterpik.The reason I ordered this through Amazon is the fact that this model seems to have been discontinued by drugstores, etc. In fact, when searching for it, it was the last model displayed on the list of models.If you are new to Waterpik and if there seems to be no flow, make sure you press down on the connecting parts. Unless they are firmly locked in place there will be no or only minimal flow. Also, there are several positions for controlling the strength of the jet - start with the weakest one to find the strength most comfortable for you.Well, the Waterpik arrived securely wrapped and in good time.I would not hesitate to order from this seller, again.
