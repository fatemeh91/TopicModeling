review/text: Beware City Select owners : this does not fot at all! its way to small to fit! the strap is too short and the other velco part that suppose to wrap around the bars are also too small to fit around the city select frame bars!! dont waste your money. youre better off buying a bigger cooler bag if youre going to have to just put it in the basket anyway...which is what I plan on doing. Very disappointing.
