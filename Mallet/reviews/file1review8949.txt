review/text: Didn't expect it to be delicious, but man, really have to chug this as quickly as possible. I've found that if you use warm water it dissolves a bit easier and becomes less gritty.I use this as a breakfast supplement in the morning because I have a hard time finding the time and money to invest in cooking myself proper meals with vegetables. I've found that I stay sated until around lunchtime without having to snack. After about a week of daily dosing, I've found that I have a great deal more energy in the mornings, and muscle recovery time from training for my 5k has been lessened. Going to buy another tub when I run out.
