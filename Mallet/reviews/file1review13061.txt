review/text: I have cervical stenosis and my physical therapist recommended an ice pack to provide pain relief for my neck. I found that trasditional ice packs were difficult to use and impossible to move around while using. This therapeutic cervical collar can be used hot or cold and is easy to use while relaxing or moving about.
