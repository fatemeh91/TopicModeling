review/text: This is a good, durable tendon strap. I suffer from pain in my forearms, just below the elbow. I also sometimes get pain on the outside, just above my elbow. The strap greatly helps both. I position the gel pad where it hurts on my forearm, and I instantly feel better (it's a very comforting feeling having support against that tendon). I find that by using these for a day or so (including overnight) at the first sign of a flare-up, I can often avert what used to be several weeks or months of mobility-limiting pain. I'm not sure if it's because the strap actually protects the tendon or if it's just because wearing the strap makes me acutely aware of overuse (a flexed tendon really strains against the strap), but whatever the case, it works for me. I've been using these for over a year now, and I haven't had an acute flare-up a single time once I resolved the flare-up I was having when I bought them. I initially needed to wear them most of the time for several weeks. Once I got better, I only needed them for a while every couple of weeks. Now I only need them every couple of months.I've never used other brands of straps, so I can't say how these compare, but these are comfortable, easy to use, and effective. My only complaint is that the Velcro goes all the way to the edge, so when I bend my arm, it can rub uncomfortably against my upper arm, but that's a fairly minor point. I would definitely recommend these.
