review/text: Got this in the mail about a week ago and have been taking it faithfully for skin issues. It's working pretty well although at first it will "purge" the skin so to speak.Be careful never to take more than the recommended amount. The capsules are in a gel form and are easy to swallow and small, and for the price you can't beat how many come in a package. If you are deficient in vitamin A it's also great and easy to remember to take them, more or less. It's a high amount of IU's so it will get anyone's levels up. It's best to take them on a full stomach as I've experienced, but they have caused me no stomach discomfort even as I have upped my dosage ( this is only what I have done for personal purposes, it is not recommended to exceed one a day). I've used Now's essential oils before for various purposes and so far it's a very good brand.Overall, a great brand and It's part of my medicine cabinet now.
