review/text: This is the first sleeping mask that I've owned so I don't have much to compare it to...My wife and I got a laugh out of how closely the front of the mask resembles the look and feel of a bra. It does a pretty good job blocking light, my biggest qualm is it's not very comfortable. Regardless of whether I sleep on my back or side I'm always very aware that this thing is on my head. I think having the velcro straps is a nice concept. Unfortunately though they double the thickness of the straps creating almost a pressure point when sleeping on your back. Then when you sleep on your side the front of the mask tends to slide or bow just a little to allow more light in and sometimes it will get positioned to lightly touch my nose creating a itching or tickling sensation.I'll continue to use this mask for the time being however I'm not planning to sleep the whole night with it. I'll just leave it by my bedside and put it on early morning when excessive light starts to creep in.
