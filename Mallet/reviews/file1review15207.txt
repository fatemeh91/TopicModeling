review/text: The first time I tried a bar I found that it tasted like a chalky, dry peanut butter cup. They kind of grew on me after that but the recommended glass of water is mandatory! Calorie and fat wise they are too high for me to eat regularly. They also have no fiber at all. Compared to other similar bars, they aren't as tasty as some and really stick in your throat. If you're a major peanut butter fan you might like them.
