review/text: My previous experience with rechargeable batteries are theRayovac I-C3 15 Minute Rechargeable Batteries, AA , 4 batteries, and they blow the socks off these sorry things.I'll charge up a batch of four and often I'll find they're dead in a matter of days just sitting in a plastic dish. I'd recommend looking into another product, as I'll personally avoid Duracell going forward.
