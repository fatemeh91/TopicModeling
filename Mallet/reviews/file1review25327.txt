review/text: Okay, picture yourself going to the dentist and you do everything right! You brush your teeth at least twice a day and floss at least every day usually more. You use mouth wash and you think you are doing okay! Heck, you even buy the sonic care tooth brush and use it till the timer stops. You then see the look on your oral hygienist face and she has the look of disgust on her face. She tells you try scraping your tongue. She tells you "I happen to have a sample of the best tongue scraper available" and it is made by Breath RX. You try it, you love it! It works great! You go to the store to purchase one and low and behold no store in town sells them. So you purchase the regular kind that have a handle and on the other end is round. You find that it works like crap! You might as well scrape your tongue with floss or your toothbrush. Well, this happened to me and I had to find the Breath RX product! I use Amazon for convenience. I don't know if they are the best price but I know that Breath RX is the best product!
