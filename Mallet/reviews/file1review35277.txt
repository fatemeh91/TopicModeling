review/text: This product did not come sealed. When I tried to return it through to the Therapy Connection, they refused to return the product due to the fact that it isn't sealed. Well, how can I use it when it did not come sealed? Just as the company is not allowing me to return it for sanitary reasons I can't use it for sanitary reasons. Unless you don't mind a product of this type being opened and possibly used, buy from another seller and ask whether or not it comes sealed.
