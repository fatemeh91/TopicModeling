review/text: I received this product yesterday, and tried it out immediately. It has a much more powerful action than the Homedics spa it replaced, and the heater is very good at quickly returning the water to the desired temperature. The foot rollers are pretty useless, as stated by a previous reviewer. I was disappointed to learn that I cannot put in any salts or soaks--even though the Amazon site has them listed under the spa. Brookstone's customer service told me I can't even put any liquid soap in, or the jets may clog. This takes a lot away from the pleasure of the home pedicure, hence my rating of only 3 stars.
