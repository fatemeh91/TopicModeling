review/text: This easy-to-use stick has become my security blanket at work. I am an admitted klutz when it comes to eating anything with high splatter potential, and with unfortunate irony, I add insult to injury by ordering high-risk dishes just before presenting at some meeting in front of senior management. That's why I have one at my desk at work to address the out-of-nowhere splatter from a spoonful of tomato soup, the inadvertent coffee drip from the not-tight-enough plastic lid, and the telltale grease spot from an aggressive mouthful of the pad thai noodles. It's not completely foolproof, but it does an effective job in removing most of the residue from non-white shirts.I often think the stronger benefit of this product is psychological, the mere fact that you are doing something proactive to eradicate your sins. However, I wouldn't bother applying it if the stain has been on your clothing for more than an hour. It is likely a foregone conclusion at that point. With the feel of a magic marker, it offers the additional virtue of convenience, especially since you need not run to the restroom to moisten a paper towel anymore. Just like a pilfered pen from the office, a Tide-to-Go stick can be found in my jacket pocket, in my dresser at home and even in the glove compartment in the car. I am honest enough with myself to know I need 24/7 protection from myself. The Tide to Go is definitely worth purchasing in multi-packs.
