review/text: My first experience with Art of Shaving products was during a time-killing visit to a mall in Miami after a cruise. My wife and I found the store and found a helpful clerk who demo'd some products for me and went over blade shaving techniques. I ended up buying their travel-size gift package, with the pre-shave oil, brush, cream, and after-shave balm, in the Sandalwood scent. It was excellent.Having found some AOS products on Amazon, I went for the lavender cream and after-shave this time. (Personally, I never found the per-shave oil very useful.) I like it a lot, just like I did with the first Sandalwood stuff I used. The only reason this isn't a 5-star rating is that it's VERY SIMILAR to the Sandalwood; the lavender scent is not very strong, either in the cream or the after-shave, and so the overall character is extremely similar to the Sandalwood. I had hoped for more difference in the scent.Still, the stuff works, to me the comfort is worth the price, and I won't stop using it. I'll just stop expecting a big difference fro scent to scent.
