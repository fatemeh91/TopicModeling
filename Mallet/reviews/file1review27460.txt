review/text: I'm on a 12 week diet plan administered by my nutritionist. I'm no "protein expert" as some would say, so if you are new to this and looking for something that tastes good like I am - at least to jump-start your new regimen, I'd skip this product.I started with one whey protein type (name unknown), along with Optimum Nutrition's chocolate casein (heavenly!). So when the initial whey supply ran out, I thought that Optimum Nutrition's double chocolate would be even better given my pleasure with the casein.Wrong.The double rich chocolate is anything but rich. In fact, I've decreased the amount of water I put in hoping to make it thicker and more richer, but it is still bland. Cold, warm, semi-cold, semi-warm... it doesn't matter. Too bad.As far as results go, I can't attribute any *one* thing - including this mix - to my success because I'm doing many things differently that cumulatively are working.
