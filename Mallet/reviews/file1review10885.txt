review/text: This knee strap has helped me greatly when I'm having trouble sleeping from knee and foot pain. I don't like to take over-the-counter meds all the time (usually acetaminophen) and I refuse to use any prescription pain killers to be able to sleep. This knee strap helps relieve both knee and foot pain that I have been able to sleep most of the time without taking any meds. I sometimes use it while walking and it has helped relieve that pain too and support my knee well. The top strap tends to slide down a lot, but the bottom strap has never slipped. It needs some sort of side supports to help keep the top strap in place. (I bought 2 of these from different vendors, so I'm leaving feedback for both.)
