review/text: Why is the exact list of ingredients so rarely found on online sellers' sites? How can one buy a supplement w/o knowing, in the exact, nitty-gritty detail the composition of the product? Only a reckless idiot would do that! The exact list of ingredients for this product is available on the VitaCost website, google for it and check it out.Here's what I didn't like: The ingredients on the bottle list 10,000 UI of Vitamin A as 200% RDA. First, 200% of RDA of anything is nothing to be dismissive about. Second, 10,000 UI is not 200% RDA. The RDA is 3,000 UI for adult males and 2,300 UI for adult females. Therefore this product contains 330% of vitamin A for males, and 430% for females.Vitamin A is not something you want to overdose on: it's poisonous and it coincides with lung cancer and osteoporosis (for more detail visit Linus Pauling Institute website: they have nice writeups for all vitamins and minerals there; I'm not posting their URL 'cause Amazon tends to remove them). Actually, 10,000 UI is the so-called "Tolerable Upper Intake Level". And don't forget that you also get vitamin A from foods, so this is over and above the pure dietary intake.LPI recommendation, I quote (emphasis mine):"[...] we recommend taking a multivitamin/multimineral supplement that provides no more than 2,500 IU of vitamin A or a supplement that provides 5,000 IU of vitamin A, >>> of which at least 50% comes from beta-carotene &lt;&lt;&lt; [...] High potency vitamin A supplements should not be used without medical supervision due to the risk of toxicity."------------------------------------------------------------------------Exact list of ingredients (from VitaCost)------------------------------------------------------------------------Supplement Facts:Serving Size: 3 TabletsServings per Container: 45 ** Amount Per Serving ** % Daily Value-------------------------------------------------------------------Vitamin A (as beta-carotene) 10000 IU 200%Vitamin C (as ascorbic acid) 120 mg 200%Vitamin D (from fish liver oil) 200 IU 50%Vitamin E (as natural mixed tocopherols) 30 IU 100%Thiamin (as thiamin mononitrate) 10 mg 667%Riboflavin 10 mg 558%Niacin (as niacinamide) 50 mg 250%Vitamin B6 (as pyridoxine hydrochloride) 10 mg 500%Folic Acid 400 mcg 100%Vitamin B12 (as cyanocobalamin) 16 mcg 267%Biotin 1500 mcg 134%Pantothenic Acid (as calcium pantothenate) 30 mg 300%Calcium (as calcium carbonate) 600 mg 60%Iron (as amino acid chelate) 6 mg 33%Iodine (from kelp) 225 mcg 150%Magnesium (as magnesium oxide) 200 mg 50%Zinc (as zinc gluconate) 15 mg 100%Selenium (as amino acid chelate) 25 mcg 33%Manganese (as amino acid chelate) 10 mg 500%Phosphorus (as dicalcium phosphate) 300 mg 30%Choline (as choline bitartrate) 150 mg *Betaine (as betaine hydrochloride) 50 mg *Inositol 60 mg *Para Aminobenzoic Acid 50 mg *RNA (ribonucleic acid) 60 mg *Citrus Bioflavonoids 50 mg *Rutin 25 mg *Gelatin 250 mg *Papain 50 mg *Oat Straw Powder 75 mg *Echinacea Leaf Powder 75 mg *Horsetail Leaf Powder 250 mg *Asparagus Shoot Powder 50 mg *Cysteine 150 mg *Methionine 100 mg *----------------------------------------------*Daily value not established.Other Ingredients: Dicalcium Phosphate, stearic acid, magnesium stearate and silica.Free Of: Added sugar, salt, starch, corn, wheat, yeast, artificial colors or preservatives.Futurebiotics Hair Skin and Nails Directions: As a dietary supplement for adults, take 3 tablets daily with a meal or as directed by a healthcare professional.Warnings: Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6.
