review/text: I would have given this a 4.5 stars but since I can't I opted for a 5 star review. It's very comfortable. the material is breathable. It blocks light well, but not perfectly. I can not sleep without one. I have gone through about 4 in three years. They last a long time. I really do wear it every night. I wish it was a little thicker so the eye pockets could be deeper and that the nose cut out was a little higher. Otherwise it's a great product that I really can not live without.
