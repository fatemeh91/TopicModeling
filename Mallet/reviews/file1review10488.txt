review/text: Very nice product! Your teeth just feel very clean after using it, much more than with a regular brush for the same amount of time. The one drawback is that it's difficult to clean the under/inner potion of the brush head. So it gets a bit grimy with old saliva well before you're supposed to replace it (even if you wash it every week as recommended). But other than that, it works great, including good battery life.
