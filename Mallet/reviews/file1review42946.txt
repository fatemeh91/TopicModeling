review/text: In an attempt to use greener cleaning products and to avoid the noxious fumes of bleach and other cleaning substances I purchased this cleaner for my bathroom and kitchen sink. It works just as well as, or better, than traditional COmet for these areas. I feel more comfortable with the ingredients of this product also - as I have a baby playing in the bathtub. Cleans great. Very satisfied with this purchase.
