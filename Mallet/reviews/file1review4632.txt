review/text: My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside, I will make one confession about Gillette's Fusion blades: Astoundingly, I have not nicked nor cut myself once during the entire duration of use. After a length of time using these blades, however, I began to suspect that, like many skeptics have cited, the Fusion shaving system was perhaps uneccessary; somehow, the skeptics claimed, five blades was simply too many to utilize. This claim appeared logical, specifically since the classic single blade Schick Injector is renowned for providing the best shave a man can obtain. Thus, in light of this newly found curiosity, I reverted back to single and double blade razors, even using the Sensor, if I am not mistaken. While the Sensor is a fine razor, the nicks and cuts sprung up like toadstools after a storm. Nevertheless, I stuck with it, essentially to determine if it was merely my skin needing an adjustment to a new shaving apparatus. Finally, after my face had taken enough abuse, I decided to test the Fusion again. Quite simply, I was amazed at how smooth and efficient the razor was upon its return. My beard comes off without a hitch and the blades seem to last in a measure of light years. I recently purchased a refill pack at a price nearing fifteen dollars, but I am confident they will last a year. The Fusion shaving system is untraditonal in size; it is an unusually bulky piece. However, there is really no denying, at least for me, that it has provided a superior shave. Like anything in life that has value, it requires a trade off to experience its benefit. Nothing is perfect; sacrifice a small comfort for progress and you will not be disappointed.
