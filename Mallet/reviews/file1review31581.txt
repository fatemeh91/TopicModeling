review/text: As the title says, this cane is all of those things. A 20yr old coming off of hip surgery, I was told I needed a cane for support in the interim between crutches and unassisted walking. I didn't want a "fuddy duddy" cane and needed something inexpensive but well made to support me. This cane is a beautiful finish, no flaws in the hand part or the shaft, very affordable, extremely stable - even for being a collapsible style, and the hand grip is quite comfortable for being just wood without extra padding. 5 stars overall, and I love that its collapsible so I'm able to throw it in my bag just in case I get tired and need it while I'm out. Excellent product!
