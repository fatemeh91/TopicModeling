review/text: I really lke Sandalwood pre shave oil and this After Shave is a pretty good compliment. The only reason it did not get a 5 star is that I like "Acqua Di Parma" products more and When I give a 5 star it is because there is no other procuct better from my point of view. This product however is much cheaper than the "Acqua Di Parma" products so if you are looking for an After Shave and you like Sandalwood this product is pretty close the best there is and comes at a more reasonable price.One thing that makes this after shave nice is that it sqirts out so you dont have to worry about getting to much on your hand before you apply it.
