review/text: Omron HEM-711AC Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor with IntelliSenseI have been using this monitor for about one week. So far so good.Easy to set up and fast reading. Note: Read instructions with respect to placement of cuff on left arm vs right arm.This month its $10.00 off price, very good deal.(April 08)
