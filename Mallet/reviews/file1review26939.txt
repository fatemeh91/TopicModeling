review/text: I've been using this mix for over a year now with great results. This is a great mix of whey protein with great flavor. Whether making a recovery drink with milk, fruit, yogurt and oj or simply making a 'snack' with just nonfat milk, I've really enjoyed this drink. Muscle recovery was improved with this protein as well, and digests very easily...this is a good one for those like me with a sensitive stomach.The flavor is great, company is respected and the cost is right. The shake also mixes very well without a blender or shake-mixer, which you can't often say with good protein powders. Amazon is your best bet for cost on this one too, especially as a Subscribe and Save item...
