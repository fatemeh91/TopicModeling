review/text: As soon as my 5.5 month old starting sitting up without any support, i knew we were ready to move on from her infant sling tub, but not quite ready, to just put her in the tub. This tub allows her the freedom of being in the tub, but with the safety of an infant sling. She has plenty of room to move around and play in there, and if she slips and falls to the side, the inflated tub more than softens her fall. Its easy to wash her hair too - I just put her head back on the tub and wash it there. She loves it and so do I! I have a feeling we will use this tub at least for 6 months or so...
