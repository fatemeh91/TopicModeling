review/text: I take this multi-vitamin because I don't have to think about supplying more of any of the suplements in it. If anyone add calcium and vitamin C (Ester_C I recommend) they would be greatly protected. Obviously there are other things everyone individually need if they have other conditions or are over 40 or 45 years old when ourbodies need more daily suplements. When I stop taking this, I feel heavy and don't want to get up, once I take it, the very next mornig I feel like a feather. Try it! Once a day too...in tablets.
