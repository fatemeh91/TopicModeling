review/text: I greatly appreciate reviewer #2 alerting us to the incorrect measurement amounts of this product since it helped me to determine proper dosages for myself and my dogs. However, I have had great success in keeping both animal and human pain in check. Before purchasing this product I was spening as much as $45.00 for 260 capsules which, between one human and three dogs, went pretty fast. I see no difference in the health of my dogs and in my own pain management since I've started using these capsules. For almost 1/2 the price, plus free shipping, I'm happy to deal with some mis-labling.
