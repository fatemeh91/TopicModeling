review/text: Thermoskin arthritic gloves worked as expected and as recommended in the ad. I would start wearing them as soon as I start feeling joint pain in my knuckles and finger joints. I even recommended it to a guy who has been a big rig driver and have constantly complained of finger joint pains for years. He's quite big hands but told him to try checking it out online if they have extra large size gloves.
