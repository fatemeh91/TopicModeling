review/text: I recently remodeled my house and removed all the carpets then switched to area rugs. This little sweeper picks up the majority of the debris though it doesn't do a great job with dog hair. The handle constantly comes apart which was really annoying - really, do they not test these things??? - but double stick tape took care of the problem.
