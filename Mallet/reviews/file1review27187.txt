review/text: Mixes fairly easily like other whey proteins I have used. I put in two scoops, put in a little bit of milk just to cover the mound of protein in the cup, mix, and fill up the rest of the cup with milk after mixing. I got the double-chocolate flavor and it tastes just like chocolate milk when mixed with skim milk.
