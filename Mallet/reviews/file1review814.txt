review/text: I'm rough on my glasses. Both nose rests came off. All parts and screws are here. The repair kit at the grocery store is useless. NB: This is small repair work. I fixed my glasses with loupes that I already had. You may need a magnifying glass and fine tweezers to work with the screws depending on your eyesight (LOL) and dexterity.
