review/text: I was extremely disappointed in the performance of this deodorant especially after all the positive reviews I'd read. I followed the preparation directions to a "T". applied the cream Monday morning and by early afternoon, I had started smelling. Now, I'm 60 years old and the most strenuous exercise I get is a brisk walk. Monday it was 73 degrees and I had my brisk walk and started smelling. Not after two or three days but after only 4 hours. I decided to carry on for a few more hours and the smell worsened. Tried applying again being more careful to spread evenly and more widely and still the same outcome so I've given up. It's all fine and dandy to try to try and not use alcohol or aluminum based deodorants but when even I can't stand to be around me why should I inflict the smell on other people?
