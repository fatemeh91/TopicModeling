review/text: This is my first trip down the whey protein line, am working on bulking by the way. After reading a lot of reviews here and knowing I am not the chocolate type, I gave the French vanilla creme a shot and went for the 5pound pack. Very nice taste and blends very well with my blender bottle( which I also bought via amazon). You don't need to add any sweeteners as it's already sweet, just some cold water and you are good.
