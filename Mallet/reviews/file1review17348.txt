review/text: At the price of the Remington MB-200, it's hard to go wrong. It works great, the preset trim gauge works like a charm. Holds a charge for many weeks and cuts with out pulling. Can't do much better than that for under $15! It fits nicely in the hand, so makes trimming very easy. I use it once every 7 to 10 days and I have to admit I look marvelous!
