review/text: I tried another generic brand of prenatal pills that always made me feel ill, even if I had food in my stomach. I take these at night, usually hours after I finished dinner and have never had any problems with a queasy stomach. The other prenatal vitamins would actually make me sick enough to wake me up. Don't get me wrong, it takes practice to get these horse pills down - if I don't get them down with a big swig of water in the first gulp, they have a tendency to make me choke and gag just because they are so huge, but I have never had a problem with the smell or taste. And I don't know if it is the pills or the pregnancy, but my skin has never looked better!
