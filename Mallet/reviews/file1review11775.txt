review/text: The only flaw I have with this protein is that Amazon claimed that for cocoa-mochaccino 1 serving had 130 Cal and 23 g protein, when it only has 21 g.Other than that the amino profile is nice and the taste is absolutely amazing. I would drink this stuff over chocolate milk any day of the week. I've also tried the cookies and creme and that also tastes ridiculously good, almost as good as this stuff, but does have 23 g. protein per serving.Highly recommend this product.
