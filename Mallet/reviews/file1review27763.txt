review/text: I often start feeling depleted in the middle of the afternoon, probably because blood sugar levels are dropping. Rather than spiking those levels with sugary drinks, or eating fat- and carb-laden snacks, I've been mixing a cup of the French vanilla flavor with skim milk. This typically results in higher energy levels within 30 minutes and carries me until dinner.This is also very good as a remedy for diabetics who may start experiencing hypoglycemia from medication. While orange juice is the standard remedy, this works about as well with longer-lasting effects.
