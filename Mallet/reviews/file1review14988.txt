review/text: I just received them, i will be taking them 3x per along with biotin 2x per day. I wash and condition my hair once a week. Today is my 1st day taking them and my scalp has this tingling feeling to it, so i hope that means it's working i will be taking them with food since there pretty big and hard for me to swallow. I'll update my review in two weeks with results if any.Ok, these definitely work, it's been two weeks and my hair has grown half an inch, i never had a problem with my skill so i haven't noticed a difference, and my nails have grown. I only took this for my hair, I've just ordered my second bottle. So far so good, I'll update this again when my first bottles done.
