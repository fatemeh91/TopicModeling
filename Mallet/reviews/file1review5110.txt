review/text: I have been eating this Iron-Tek protein for over a year now and loved it, however recently they have changed the formula to a "new and improved taste"...it's horrible. It is not as sweet, and it tastes "protein-y" which is why I used to like about this brand because it didn't. If you are a long-time lover of this brand, the "new and improved taste" is not what you used to eat.
