review/text: It only seals if the bowl is al least 1/2 inch smaller, but then the edge hangs over making it hard to put in and take out of the fridge. I really wanted something I could put over a bowl and take to work for lunch (in a bag) so it's useless for that. It is OK for storing stuff in the fridge. I haven't needed to try it as a cooking lid so don't know how it works for that.
