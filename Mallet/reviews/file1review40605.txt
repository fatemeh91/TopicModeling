review/text: I have used the Earth Friendly Products Wave automatic dishwashing gel for almost a year and can't stand that it doesn't work! I can always find it at local stores for cheap, its not harmful to the environment, and smells nice but just doesn't work! We rinse our dishes when done eating and toss in the sink or on counter until there's enough to do a load, so it's not like we are throwing caked-on raunchy dishes at this detergent and still expecting it to work. We clean the dishwasher itself with vinegar and baking soda about every 6 weeks just to be sure that it's not the dishwasher causing problems. We always make sure to run the hot water in the nearest faucet until super hot to be sure the dishwasher is getting hot enough water. We have tried using the directions on the back of the bottle which says to only fill one detergent cup b/c it's 2x concentrated, we tried using more, less, and too much which only caused overflow problems. Nothing works with this stuff!When the dishes come out of the dishwasher the glasses are sparkling clear but with bits of food stuck on the inside, the plastics come out cloudy but no food bits stuck on them, and all the Corelle/Corningware/Vitrelle dishes are very clean except for the bits of tiny food particles stuck on! Any silicone bakewear or spatulas come out dirtier than when they went in! Stainless steel dishes come out with food bits everywhere, enamel-coated pans come out worse than they went in too! I love Earth Friendly products' Ecos laundry detergent so I assumed their dishwasher gel would work great too, but it just doesn't :-( After much frustration with this product I have switched over to Nellie's All-Natural Automatic Dishwasher Powder and couldn't be happier.I gave it three stars because it is earth friendly, it's dirt cheap, and smells nice without a chemically overpowering scent.
