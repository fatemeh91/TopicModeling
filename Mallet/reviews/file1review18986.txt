review/text: I ordered this product, but received a different product than the one I ordered (and I did recheck my order). Now it is difficult to locate the seller to make any kind of exchange. Amazon doesn't handle these requests. So now I am stuck with the wrong bottle! I have used the Magnesium Citrate for many years, so I know it is a good product! I give it 2 stars for being a good product, but unfortunately the seller made a mistake that wasn't handled.
