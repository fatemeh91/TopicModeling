review/text: I've used this product for nearly a year now and I hope it's available to me forever, and that the quality does not change. I've never taken the time to review a product, at least not that I remember, but I want do all that I can to ensure that this product stays on the market. It's a little annoying to read the negative reviews of this formula, because it all has to do with how it tastes. If we're worried about taste, we'll stick with McDonald shakes, but if it's a super, nutrient dense supplement you're looking for, then give it the 5-stars it deserves. I use this formula almost daily, and I disguise the earthy taste with yogurt, blue agave, berries, bananas, fruit juice and a few other special ingredients which transform it into a yummy smoothy. If you drink it with water only, it will probably act as a stomach cleanser and come back up, because the taste really is awful. But if you're looking for increased, energy, an improved sense of general well-being (with little added perks like nicer hair and skin) than I'm serious..this product is AMAZING. Be creative, and you won't taste it at all, but believe me after a few months you'll notice a tremendous difference in the way you feel, and possibly the way you look! I love it.
