review/text: The product is innovative, the flosser makes it easier to floss hard to reach areas but is ergonomically quite poor. My hand starts to cramp by the time I'm half-way done, mostly because of the odd placement of the button -- you need to hold it down for the vibrating action to work.I'm giving it 3 stars because I think it works better than regular floss and the non-moving floss kits in hard to reach areas.
