review/text: Not much to say except it does exactly what it's suppose to do. The biggest thing about protein powder is the taste. Despite this flavor being called Caramel Toffee, it taste like Coffee with little to no aftertaste, and I drink it with water. So that's really the big thing. The protein powder that I use to get had more protein per serving but was becoming too expensive. But one thing I like about Optimum Nutrition is the variety of flavors and they are highly rated among protein powder. Plan to continue buying.
