review/text: Hi this stuff is good to balance my protein intake. It's low on carb, fat and sodium. Watch the cholesterol though. I don't use it everyday but probably 75%. It can taste a bit chalky and metallic. I use it with water mostly and I whip it with an aerolatte (coffee frother). I find the taste is better with really cold water. It can also be made with a shaker. Most people make a shake with added frozen fruit and any kind of milk. I don't like to drag out the blender.
