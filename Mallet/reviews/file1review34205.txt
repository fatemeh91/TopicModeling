review/text: Unlike Preparation H and similar over-the-counter creams sold in the US (which are way too weak and do nothing for me), this one actually does something. I have thrombosed hemorrhoids which produce some of the most severe pain imaginable. Even prescription-only American creams like Lidocaine HCl 3% are totally useless for me.This Chinese cream actually does help with the pain a little bit, not a whole lot, but it cools the swelling and there is some relief. It's the first ointment I've tried that does something. As the previous poster said, it's like applying an ice cube to the area, with some anti-swelling agents. Expect some immediate relief, though partial.Hemorrhoids, particularly thrombosed ones, are a serious matter that requires strong painkillers like Ibuprofen and Percoset (there's not a lot that topical creams can do). But this particular cream can be used in conjunction, for maximum relief with the swelling. Recommended.
