review/text: After searching in the price range of under $30 dollars for a nose hair trimmer I realized that they were all going to be battery powered. I decided to go with this little "bad boy." Let me just start by saying that if you are looking to buy this product, you better have three inch nose hairs because this little device is unable to trim my nose hairs. Basically you have two small blades attached to two plastic hooks. The plastic hooks are spun by a plastic notch (hint: all plastic usually means garbage.) Since it is only powered by one battery it lacks power. Just to see if this thing really could cut hair I tried to trim a piece of hair on my head and just as I expected it whipped the piece of hair around in a circular motion failing to cut it. Bottom line, this is a very poorly made product (Made in China) with a Panasonic logo that should NOT be on this product. I have never purchased anything by Panasonic that was made this poorly.
