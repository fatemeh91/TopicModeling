review/text: I bought these after researching many different vitamins and I'm so happy I did. They have all the nutrients I need and they don't constipate me, though I do take a fiber gummy with them. They are pretty expensive in the store but the Amazon price makes them very affordable. Worth the extra money to know I'm not getting all the junk and lead that are in other prenatal vitamins. Yes, I said lead! See the link here for more info about lead in vitamins:[...]The Rainbow light complete prenatal system is quite a bit higher in lead however this prenatal one is fairly low.
