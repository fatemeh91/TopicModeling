review/text: What to say. It's got a nice strong motor so no snagging, just clean cuts, the battery charges fast and holds for a decent amount of time, the guard is easy to use, what with the click wheel, and easy to pop off, no risk of losing multiple small guards.However the guard itself is a big of a problem. The "teeth" of the guard are super, super soft. Any amount of pressure will cause them to be pushed down, lowing a 5 level to a 3 and a 3 to a 1 and so on. If the guard were made of a harder, less flexible plastic, I'd give it five, as it is, you have to be super, super gentle and not put any pressure on it, otherwise you'll end up with patches of your beard shorter than in other spots where you used a lighter touch.
