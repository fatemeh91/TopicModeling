review/text: I have been taking this product for a few months and it works for me. Not sure why it works for some and not others. It does have ginger in it. So if you are sensitive to ginger, perhaps this is the problem. I usually take a capsule with a big meal that might be hard to digest. I do not take it at every meal, nor every day. Once I sprinkled some of it on some beans and rice, and it liquified it. Also works very well if I have indigestion. I would recommend this product if you have trouble digesting some foods or after a very large meal. Also good if you are sedentary or are driving a lot and eating fast food. I recommend trying a probiotic (ultimate flora) for supporting the digestion of dairy products.I intend to buy this product again.
