review/text: I have been using Philips epilator which I bought in Europe for 10 years. It just died then I was looking for replacement. I did not know Norelco is a part of Philips, so it took time to find this one.This is almost same with the one I had. Does not need any more fancy technology, this is just enough for the purpose. From the experience of more than 10 years, this is the best method to keep smooth legs if you cannot afford laser hair removal all over your body.However, Using this machine is NOT painless procedure for first couple of rounds. If you have just kept shaving your legs, the more expensive models have some feature to reduce pain. If you do waxing, you must have used to pain. This model is good enough.
