review/text: This is more a question than a review. I love the Lysol Floor cleaner that I used to use with my Hoover Hardfloor cleaner when I had a house full of ceramic tile. I just bought a house with marble floors. I am wondering if I can still use the Floor cleaner and the Lysol. Anyone know???Thanks
