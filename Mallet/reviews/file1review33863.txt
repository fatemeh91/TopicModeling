review/text: I am not a medical expert and just bought the stethoscope to listen to my sons chest since he has "reactive airways". I have found it them to be quite clear. They feel quite solid as well and come with an extra diaphragm. The earpiece are a bit painful so I would not want to wear them all day long.
