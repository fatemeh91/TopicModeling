review/text: Read reviews on what seemed like hundreds of various products and decided to try this one out after reading the good reviews. Well, i am glad i did my research. When your choosing something that you know will get messy but you will need often....think simple and this little product is just that. Its very well designed for quick installation and no worries on it moving around, the rubber edge grips well. When you need to clean it, throw it in the shower spray it down with some bleach and voila ready for another go. If your on the market for a good product this is it.
