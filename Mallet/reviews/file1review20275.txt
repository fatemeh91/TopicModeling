review/text: I do not use these as diapers, but I couldn't live w/o them. When my baby was really little, I used them on the changing pad to keep from having to change the changing pad cover constantly. These are much easier to change and wash than those covers. These are also the best burp cloths. My daughter has really bad acid reflux, and not many burp cloths can stand up to a good spit up. I go through about 5 a day. They are VERY absorbant!
