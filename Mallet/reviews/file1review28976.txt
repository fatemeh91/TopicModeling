review/text: I used a Remington for quite some time, but then started traveling a great deal. The Remington could not withstand the shock and broke quite often. A razor repairman suggested that I try a Braun.The Braun cruzer Z-50 is an excellent razor. It's very sturdy, has a long lasting battery, many features and provides a consistent and close shave. I recommend it highly.
