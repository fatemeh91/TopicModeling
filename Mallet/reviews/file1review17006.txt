review/text: Bought this because my husband's last one died and we were desperate for another one! The price was right (around $15) and we like the fact that it has the adjustable height without having to change the trimmer head. It does a good job.We wish it would work when plugged in (if it has lost its charge, and you plug it in, you have to wait for it to recharge before being able to use it, as opposed to being to use it while plugged in).The fact that it doesn't have a "base" for charging (just a cord you plug in) doesn't matter to us, but it might to some consumers so please be aware that you'll have to lay it flat somewhere.
