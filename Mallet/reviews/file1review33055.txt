review/text: Wow. I've been using this product for years with much success. At the first sign of imbalance, I take this product and have found it to ward off numerous illnesses (or reduce the severity tremendously). I have always preferred herbal remedies to pharmaceuticals and this product is definitely one of the best! The true test was getting my dad (a die hard skeptic when I approached him with this formula) to try Wellness Formula. He always viewed my herbal remedies with disdain until he got sick enough to "try anything." I gave him what I had left of my Wellness Formula and he became a true believer! Now that's a testimony! The only problem when taking the formula is as mentioned before the size of the pills (the capsules are easier to take but it requires taking more of them) and a side effect of horrible gas (yes, thi has happened with all of my family when using the product). Doesn't matter since no body wants to be around you when you are getting sick anyway! Definitely a super product!
