review/text: We own several OXO products, and love them all...except this one. We liked the &quot;Good Grips&quot; handle and the rounded brush. Beyond that, it is useless. The sponge never recieves enough soap, which is frustrating, and the durability is nil. After less that a week, on average, the sponge separates from the plastic backing that attaches it to the soap dispensing handle, rendering it useless. The sponge is barely worn, yet you have to throw it out and buy a new one. This is disappointing for a company that seems to have such well made products. We sent an e-mail describing the design problem to OXO customer service, and did not recieve a satisfactory reply. I hope they listen to their customers and pull this off the market, and replace it with a more durable product.
