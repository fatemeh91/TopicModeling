review/text: This is a great product with versatility, but takes getting used to the girth. Use some lube for sure. The price is worth it after researching prices of similar products around local stores...save $10 or more on this product. It has a funny smell at first, but clean with some alcohol and it will fade. I also rinse in water, but probably don't submerge like others say...overall, you and your partner should have a fun time...or if you need/have to have some time for yourself!
