review/text: I'm very satisfied with this product. I've always used Edge before, and have never tried Gillette. But now I like Gillette better. I'll definitely switch. I cannot say any particular thing I really like about this product -- because I like everything about it. I shave better with this product. Also, I think it protects my skin better than Edge. I'd recommend this product to anyone who's looking for a shaving cream.
