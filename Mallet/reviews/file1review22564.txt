review/text: I am actually not into the insertion thing all that much and much prefer using what comes natural, but alas, I have to satisfy my long term partner (two months now...a record for me) and she enjoys using this toy. And let me tell you she does enjoy it...ergo, I am giving it five stars. Were I to complain about it...which I really am not, I would say that:I am built rather small down there and the girth of this thing is a bit difficult to handle especially in the early stages of love making. I most certainly need a lot of warm up time (which is a good thing I suppose as I do enjoy that phase of kicking it), and I most certainly must use a goodly amount of lubricant with this...again, especially in the beginning.It is rather sticky and must be cleaned immediately after use and stored in a nice clean place. To be honest, I rather like slipping a condom over the thing...at least my end...before use.But hey, she likes it and that is fine with me.
