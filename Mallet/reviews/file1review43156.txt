review/text: I've used this on the tub for several months. It actually does improve the soap scum ring with no more elbow work than simply spraying it around. Compared to all the nasty products out there that are supposed to do the same thing, the scent is heavenly. The trigger container is easy to use. The Daily Shower Spray does leave a bit of residue so that I see a tiny bit of soap bubbles in the tub the next time I run it, but that is easily taken care of with a super-quick rinse. Excellent product that looks nice, too.
