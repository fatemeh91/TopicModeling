review/text: I really like these! With the subscribe & save option I have not been able to find a lower price at any box stores. I did a some research on recommended vitamin levels for prenatal's & compared tons of labels on a number of different brands. This one seems to check all the boxes and is supper gentle on my stomach. I can take them with or with out food. This is saying a lot because I've never been able to take regular multivitamins on a empty stomach.
