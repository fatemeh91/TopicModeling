review/text: I have great skin, and I owe a lot of that to this product! It is a gentle, effective, and refreshing cleanser that has a nice light smell to it. I previously worked at a high-end salon and spa, that exclusively sold Dermalogica products. One of the estheticians that I worked with recommended this product to me after a very bad experience with Clinique products. I must say, I have never had a face wash agree with my skin the way this one does! I use it morning and night, followed by La Mer moisturizing lotion. You should most definitely try this product, you won't be disappointed!
