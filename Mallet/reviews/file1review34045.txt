review/text: This is hands-down the best lint removal tool out there. I have purchased so many different lint removal items it's ridiculous. This handles everything including pet hair. It's a miracle product! I suppose that's why they call it "Magik"! I officially own three of these, but would not be opposed to owning enough to have one in every room, every vehicle, and to give them away as gifts.
