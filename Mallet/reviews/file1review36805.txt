review/text: a number of years ago I had a hip replacementI purchased from a local med supply house a sock puller. It was excellent, but alas it wore out. I went to my local pharmacy and purchased a replacement. It was terrible, too stiff and large for my needs. It was made of plastic and very inflexible. I saw one on amazon which looked identical to my original one. I purchased it for less than the original. It works perfectly even better than the original. I am very satisfied with it. The only down side is that the pull straps are a little too short.
