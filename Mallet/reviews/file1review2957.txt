review/text: I have problems with severe anemia. While I took this product, I got my iron levels up and got fairly healthy. Unfortunately, it is not always easy to find Desi-Cates. When I stopped taking it my iron levels slipped significantly. Presently, I am working to get them back within a normal range. To help this process, I just located Desi-Cates at another source online. Given my past experience I know that works very well when taken regularly. I highly recommend it!
