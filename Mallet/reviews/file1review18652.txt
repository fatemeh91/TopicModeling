review/text: The Twist-n-Bend extra heavy hand bar is a solid tube of rubber. It comes coated with a powder that is to keep it dry in its sealed wrapping. A considerable amount of time goes by before the powder is removed from the rubber, even if it is washed in cold water. With use, a gritty residue comes to the surface of the rubber and the bar along with your hands have to be wiped off after the workout. Maximum force is necessary to bend and twist this hand bar, so it is not for someone who lacks superior arm strength. The X-Heavy model provides a good supplement to arm workouts and would be of great use for wrestlers, judo & jiu-jitsu competitors, along with boxers, bouncers, and anyone else that is in combat sports or situations.Average folks should use the medium, light, x-light or xx-light model of the Twist-n-Bend.For the price, its probably a better choice than the more expensive name brand model by Thera-Band.
