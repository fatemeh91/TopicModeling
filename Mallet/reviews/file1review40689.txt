review/text: After a few uses of this shampoo by both of my daughters, I wondered if maybe they weren't using enough of the shampoo, or just not taking their time. When I touched their hair, it still felt straw-like from the chlorine. So I helped my youngest wash her hair the next time she went swimming, but found it really wasn't doing the job of removing the chlorine. The shampoo smells great! But what I found is that regular clarifying shampoo has worked the best (as it was suggested by my hairdresser)!
