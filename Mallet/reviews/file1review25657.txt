review/text: This little gem of a self torture device serves quite well in ripping out hairs by the root. The so called blades inside the head do not cut but instead the wind up your hairs and rip them out at the root. The amount of blood flow I experienced far out did any of my less than sober attempts using scissors. So if you enjoy that excruciating pain of shredding the inside of your nose, please buy this device.
