review/text: The product is totally inferior to what I was expecting and advertised. I returned the item and asked for a refund. Hard to find someone to communicate with satisfactorily. When finally I got the money, it was substantially less than the money I paid for! Nobody cared to give me the explanation. All my emails went unanswered! I am terribly dissatisfied with this product, the company, and the service.
