review/text: I bought this product about a month ago (through Amazon) after reading all the glowing reviews. Fortunately, by the time it arrived, the episode cleared up and I didn't need to use it at that time. Fast forward to last night, I had another episode with severe pain. I remember I had the ointment and applied it. It is like the reviews say: the smell is much like Vicks Vapor Rub and once applied you feel almost a cooling, minty sensation - great for sinus congestion and after dinner mints, but not for an inflamedrectal region. I lied down to wait for relief and re-read the reviews to see how long it took others to feel a difference. That's when I noticed that the tone in each review sounded the same. Meanwhile, the "cooling" sensation kept getting stronger, but I persevered because I was desperate and really wanted to believe the product would work. The sensation lasted about 2.5 hours when I decided to clean off any residual ointment and scrap this product. In the hours following, the swelling got much worse as did the other symptoms. I can't say that the product exacerbated the issue, but everything I mentioned above was enough for me to throw the tube out. Overall, I would not recommend this product. If you are having hemorrhoidal issues, best to stick to what you know and calling your doctor. This is not the miracle ointment the reviews make it out to be.
