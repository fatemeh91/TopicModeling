review/text: I have been using the SleepKey for about 60 days continuously. I have suffered from sleeping problems since I was a teen. The SleepKey has enabled me to improve my sleep efficiency from a starting value of 57% to an average that hovers around 90%. This means that I'm getting about the same amount of sleep (about 5:45 hours per night) but am spending much less time getting it. This has given me many more hours to read, etc., especially during the weekends, because I don't sleep in anymore.One other benefit is that my wife is sleeping better, probably because I'm not waking up in the middle of the night which was disturbing her sleep.I strongly recommend this product. It is well made and the program it uses is well thought out.
