review/text: I used this product for about a week and a half then decided to stop using it. At first I had the straps adjusted too tight which made my foot and leg hurt from squeezing too much. Then I loosened them and thought it would be better but my foot hurt so much that I would wake up about 3AM in pain and would have to take it off and the sound of velcro peeling away at 3AM also wakes up the person beside you too. When you lay down your foot naturally wants to turn to the side and with this brace on, it put pressure against the side of my foot which was tolarable for a few hours but then it would really start hurting where the strap went around my foot. If I kept my foot pointed straght up then it did not pull but that isn't how my foot is naturally positioned when I sleep. It's a little pricy for what it actually is.
