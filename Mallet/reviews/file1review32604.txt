review/text: I have been drinking another brand of hisbiscus tea for a while now, and came across this brand, and decided to try it! I was not disappointed! It is very tasty with that kick of lemongrass. I add a teaspoon of honey and sit back and enjoy! It has the dark red color of my other brand, and from now on I will be purchasing both brands! Cannot say yet if this brand has lowered my blood pressure, but I know the other brand did and since they are both hisbiscus, I would imagine that this would too!
