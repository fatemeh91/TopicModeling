review/text: If you like using a waxing product, this one is great. I used it on several areas of my body and it did the job, was easy to use, and easy to clean up. I really liked the fact that there was nothing to heat up (just run the tube under warm water if it needs to be softened). I'd really recommend using this product if you like waxing. If you've never waxed before, make sure you try it on a small area first. It can take some getting used to and be painful!
