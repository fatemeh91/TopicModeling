review/text: After having numerous store-bought scales, always thinking, Geez, I don't weigh that much or WOW,I lost a few,only to find out the scale was the culprit. The adjusting wheel would only "Zero" the dial, and not correct the problem. The Detecto "physicians scale"Detecto 437 Balance Beam Doctor/Physician Scale, 400 lbs, Made in the USAis just what I was looking for. After an easy assembly and adjustment I checked the accuracy by putting various weights on the platform, from 25#s to 250#s and it was "right on". I wish I would have bought this sooner, and it's "Made in the USA" !!!!
