review/text: Great idea. Bad quality. It has some issues cutting long hair but you have the trimmer/whatever. Well, tonight the trimmer chocked and died on me on my beard. Basically the blades got enough "hair inside" that something got suck and stopped moving. I have had this product for about 4-6 months.Sorry but if a product is aimed at trimming beards/goatees, etc also, I expect it to work *and last*. Didn't.Went back to my Norelco for a second to finish my shave (it runs low on batteries even at full charge for being old) and I was surprised how much better even in non-trimmer mode it grabbed longer hair.My disappointment is that Norelco doesn't make an "all in one" product like this anymore. They charge high, but I have to say, they work better, and I think this is the first and last Braun shaving product I buy.Hint to Braun: you have the right idea. But it needs to last. Even if that means charging $20 USD more for it.
