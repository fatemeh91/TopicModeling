review/text: Not enough information is given in the product description: it is cumbersome to break off, bend repeatedly, peel off the backing from one (microscopic) corner flap, then push through the foil---all to liberate one chewing piece of gum! Nicorette is available in a much more user-friendly format, akin to other, regular, popular packaged gum brands. I should which type of packagedNicorette I am getting when I order! The gum itself is good. This comment applies to the 2 mg and 4 mg types.
