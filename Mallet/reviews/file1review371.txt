review/text: I have a very active household, so I was wary of getting ANYTHING that vibrates in fear of being heard. However, this is VERY quiet, I would say if you want to use it on the top speeds (although I haven't found the need to use it above the first) maybe have something like a desk fan to cover the sound if you want to keep it undetected. The twisting motion of the head can be a little more noticeable than the vibrating bullet, it's almost like a power drill on low, but it's muted. Again, anything above the first, you might wanna have some cover up.Also, something that wasn't covered in the description (if it was, I didn't see it): There's a panel with an increase button and decrease button for vibration and rotation of the head separately, so you can have all vibration, or a little of both, or just the rotation (there's also a button to switch the direction of the rotation) and at low, medium or high.I personally prefer more of an thrusting experience, so this probably won't be my favorite toy. I think I'll just stick to my boyfriend for now, hehe...however, it's not a waste of money. Definitely nice to have in the collection.
