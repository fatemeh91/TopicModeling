review/text: If you have post-herpetic pain from shingles, like me, you will probably try anything. This product did not help me at all and irritated my skin. Web Vitamins does not accept the return of opened products. Knowing the pain and itching, I would not dissuade anyone from trying anything and from the reviews, this product has helped some people. I would,however,try to find a vendor that will accept a return if the product does not help you. The good news is, fortunately, with time, the pain and itching is getting better. Also, a very simple moisturizing cream did help me.
