review/text: I use this to trim my hair and my goatee mustache/beard. The wheel adjustabillity is a big plus on this trimmer. With in minutes I am completely groomed every few days. I have the lengths down on the wheel, and they are very precise. It is also built very sturdy. Really recommend this trimmer.
