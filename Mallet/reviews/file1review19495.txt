review/text: We have a tall toilet with a long seat and I was worried this wouldn't fit. Somehow I missed in all the reviews and description that it has a WHEEL on the underside that you can adjust to fit ANY toilet. As a result, it fits our toilet perfect.My daughter started using this at 14 months old and has never had any issue falling through. We tried a few other cheaper toilet seats and they slid around and scared her. You have to be careful because this can scare a kid off for a good while. Also, the other ones left marks on her bottom and I had to hold her to keep her from falling through.You will love this!
