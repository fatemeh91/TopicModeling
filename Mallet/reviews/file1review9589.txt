review/text: I like the taste of the Protein Plus Chocolate Chocolate Chunk bars a lot! I cut them in thirds because these are the larger 320 calorie bars. I eat one-third before my workout and one-third after. I also enjoy the Pure Protein bars which are smaller but the flavor of these is awesome.
