review/text: I take plavix and aspirin at my doctor's instructions and I find that I bruise easily.A friend recommended the Arnicare and I tried it and I'm surprised that it helps. My wife agrees. The bruises go away a little faster. It's nice not to look like I just had a match with a Suomo wrestler and lost. Thanks Arnicare.
