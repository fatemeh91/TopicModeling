review/text: I started using this detergent after I purchased a front load washer. Back then it was not very easy to find HE detergents. I have purchased this locally several times. It is not always easy to find. Only 3 grocery stores in my area carry this detergent and they frequently run out of the Lavender scent (my favorite). The amazon price was lower than the grocery stores and I didn't have to pay for shipping. The bottles did not leak during shipment.
