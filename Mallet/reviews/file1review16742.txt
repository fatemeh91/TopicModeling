review/text: These are great panty liners. They fit in my panties well and people don't know about them. I wear one for everyday freshness and to keep me dry. The purse packs are great. Now, I can keep them in my locker and no boys will know about my feminine needs. When I get a purse, I will keep some in there too. I really enjoy this product as I feel very comfortable with a fresh and dry panty.
