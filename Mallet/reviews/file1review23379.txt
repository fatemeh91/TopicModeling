review/text: It has been several weeks since I ordered a cane, and it NEVER has arrived. I am very disappointed in the customer service of this company. I have e-mailed the company several times, with no response. If I want to contact them by phone, it is long distance for me. I want a refund. Buyer beware if you choose to purchase something from this company. Again, very poor customer service.
