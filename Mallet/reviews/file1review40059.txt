review/text: I got this for my daughter when I couldn't find her regular toothpaste she liked. Thought the BubbleMint would be interesting, and it actually has an interesting smell, but my daughter was not to excited about it. She normally loves breashing her teeth, lost some interest while using this, but was happy to brush her teeth once she went back to her original toothpaste. It might be good at cavity protection, but only if you can get your kids to use it. Although BubbleMint might sound good in theory, but the actual taste is not there.
