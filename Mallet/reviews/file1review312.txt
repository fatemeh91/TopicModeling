review/text: It does take some getting used to...it is a little big and I didn't like it right away...BUT trust me if you have problems with the size and the bunny ear position, BUY LUBRICANT it makes the experience WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY more pleasurable in my opinion.... also use BRAND NEW batteries , it requires 3 AA's that gives it way more power. This is defiantly the best vibrator for the price!!!!!!!!!!!!
