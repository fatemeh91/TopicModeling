review/text: This is the first time I bought this product. Actually I bought it for my father who is very naive in using advanced technologies. The manual version of this razor was perfect for him. He likes it so far. The precision of shaving is great. It is little expensive as compared to other available razors. But it is a great product for the amount you pay. I would recommend this one to others. I hope the blades will last long enough which I am yet to find out.
