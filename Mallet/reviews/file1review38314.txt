review/text: I was a faithful Epilady user for years. Then I got lured by the high ratings of the Braun 5270... and bought it...and hated it! A friend recommended the Epilady Optima, and life is back to good. It works fast and efficient. I can be done in 20 min (vs. over an hour with the Braun) and because it works well, it's actually much gentler on the skin in sensitive areas. So the Epilady gets my vote, hands down.
