review/text: I used these as a stocking stuffer last Christmas. My grown daughter had expressed a need one day in conversation. She was pleasantly surprised to have them appear. They were, of course, just what she wanted, she loved them and has used them up. Looks like I have one stocking stuffer checked off the list for Christmas 2012. Would I buy this product from this vendor again? Absolutely yes.
