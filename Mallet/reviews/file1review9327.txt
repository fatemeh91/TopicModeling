review/text: I bought this for my daughter and we find it pretty handy. Not only does it hold the pills for the week but you can take the day you need with you instead of taking the whole thing. I think it's a very good product - especially for someone on the go a lot and doesn't want to drag a large pill case with them. The only issue is maybe losing one of them if you're not careful.
