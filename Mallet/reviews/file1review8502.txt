review/text: I know, I know. Too soft? How else would they fit into the small neck of a baby bottle, right?Well, I have some scum in the bottom of these baby bottles and this is not working to scrub it out. No matter how hard I push. So while this fits into bottles, and will &#34;clean&#34; bottles that don't have dried milk scum on them, it won't scrub them. It's about as soft as a soft toothbrush. We have a dishwasher, too, so this is stuff that won't really come clean without some powerful bristles.P.S. The milk scum is from almond milk, which we gave my daughter when she was sick with a chest cold instead of regular milk, which makes the mucus thicker.
