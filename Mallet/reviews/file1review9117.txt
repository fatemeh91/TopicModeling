review/text: I wanted to get away from taking isolated vitamins and minerals so I now take Green Vibrance 45 minutes after breakfast each day. A couple sales people at Super Supplements recommended it over other brands, telling me that although there are less expensive alternatives, Green Vibrance uses high quality ingredients without cheap fillers to reduce the cost. And at $50 for a 2 month supply, it's a great deal through Amazon. I still take fish oil, CoQ10, and vitamin D along with a good diet so I feel I'm pretty well covered health wise.
