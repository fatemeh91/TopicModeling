review/text: I would love to give this product 5 stars. It is made from a very flexible but well insulating material, and the design allows you full dexterous use of your hands, and full fingertip use for intricate work.But after only a few month's use, the stitching is starting to unravel at the palm nearest to the base of the thumb.But use the sizing chart [ web search: "thermoskin arthritic gloves sizing chart" ] before ordering, and I strongly recommend moving one size up. You *WILL* lose some dexterity, but the larger size will mean less stress on the stitching when putting on or taking off the gloves, for longer life.
