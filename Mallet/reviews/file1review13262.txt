review/text: I purchased this liner to protect the mattress while my kids are working on night potty training. It is great. When my kids have an accident, it captures all of the pee without leakage. It is also wide and long enough so that when the kids move around a lot during sleep it is still under them. I had previously ordered other liners, but this one is superior (in terms of size and leakage). A great product I wholeheartedly recommend.
