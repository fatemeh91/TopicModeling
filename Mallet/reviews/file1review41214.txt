review/text: Being in my fifties, I've noticed issues with short-term memory and recall ability. I started researching brain vitimins and found that they helped. But when I needed to begin a new career, I decided to give Higher Mind a try since I was impressed with the makeup of their formula. I have noticed a big improvement. I have better recall and sharper short term memory. I will definitely stay with this product.
