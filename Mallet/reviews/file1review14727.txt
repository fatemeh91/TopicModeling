review/text: If you need immediate results for increased breast milk supply, you need to follow these instructions or grab another herb. Mother's milk is a great supplement to increase your breast milk as well as decreased stress, proper diet, and support! I took fenugreek and mother's milk supplements together and saw a great improvement. My stress level was also very high. (My husband was deployed) Take care of your body and seek help if you feel your breast milk supply is low.
