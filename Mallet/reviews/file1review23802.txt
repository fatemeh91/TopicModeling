review/text: Cellaplex has done a world of good for my knee problems. I need knee replacement surgery; however, have been putting it off for as long as possible because I can't take time off from work. Prior to taking Cellaplex, I was taking another glucosamine/condroitin medication, along with Tramadol, but this seems to do the trick amazingly well. I've even send a bottle to my brother in Seattle who has knee problems also.....I used to purchase this at Costco, but they stopped carrying it, so I was very glad to see that Amazon is carrying it so I can continue having a relatively pain-free day. As a note, I no longer have to wear the thigh-to-calve brace that my orthopedic doctor ordered for me....Cellaplex has taken away the need for now.
