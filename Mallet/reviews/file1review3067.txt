review/text: The condom itself seems fine, but runs a bit small. If you have a larger penis, you will probably feel like this is squeezing you a bit much, if you can get it on at all. Also, they are not lubricated, which isn't a problem for us, but something you should know. Otherwise, I've been informed that they feel less like wearing a plastic bag than other condoms.
