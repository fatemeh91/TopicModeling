review/text: I'm an amateur body-builder on a budget. Most body-building experts suggest a minimum of 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight per day. That's a lot. I used to eat several cans of albacore (tuna) to achieve the protein requirement but got concerened about Mercury levels in my body from eating all that tuna. Plus, you can only eat so much before you just get sick of it. This product makes getting all the protein one needs a breeze and at a cost signicantly less than that of tuna or any store bought food. In fact if there's a better grams-of-protein-per-dollar value available, someone please let me know about it! And from what I've read, Whey is the way (no pun intended) to go as far as protein supplements. Lastly, I think it tastes pretty good (close to chocolate milk) too, and doesn't have a lot (any?) of sugar, although it's hard to avoid clumps without a blender.
