review/text: Not only did it take from June 21st to July 8th to receive the deodorant, it arrived in what appeared to be a used condition. The sanitary cover for the actual deodorant stick was removed. And the top rim of the applicator had many cracks and a few small pieces missing. Anyone stupid enough to attempt to use this deodorant stick (and catch some rare skin disease) could possibly cut themselves under their arms. I wonder if this could have been a returned item or just one someone tried out before sending it cross country. Considering it might be contaminated I threw it out not wanting to go through the time wasting hassle of returning this piece of garbage.
