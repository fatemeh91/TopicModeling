review/text: My previous beard trimmer I paid around $50-$60 dollars for. It lasted a year.Burned by that experience I thought I try something a bit more budget friendly, and much to my surprise this Remington actually cuts better than my previous non-Remington model. It feels solid, is simple to use, and trims more evenly and with fewer retries over the same area. This one is a keeper.
