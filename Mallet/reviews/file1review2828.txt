review/text: This lube is really top quality. I saw a recommendation for it in a men's magazine, so we decided to give it a try. It lasts a very long time. There is a slight flavor to it even though it touts itself as being no flavor and no smell. It never gets sticky or goopy. Holds up to the job.
