review/text: While I found the device to be somewhat effective in removing hair (I did eventually grow accustomed to the sensation and it did indeed become much less painful than the first experience), I found that the rotating tweezers would break down and stop spinning after just a few months. I foolishly thought I would give it another try, so I bought another one and the same problem occurred. I might add that I noticed that the best results would occur when the product was new, and that it actually seemed to gradually spin more and more slowly over the course of use, until it actually just stopped working just a few months later. Perhaps my experience is unique, but I will certainly not buy the Optima again.
