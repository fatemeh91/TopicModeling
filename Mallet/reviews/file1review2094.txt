review/text: Bought these for my Dad & also his friend who are in wheelchairs in Assisted Living. Would HIGHLY recommend for use on a wheelchair. Just put the pockets on the inside of the chair, not the outside as shown in the picture because they get in the way of the wheels. When used on the inside of the chair, there is still plenty of room to sit in the chair and they are not in the way. They can put their mail in the pockets, they carry hand sanitizer in them and they can even bring leftover food from their meals back to their rooms in a small container.
