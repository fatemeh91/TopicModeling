review/text: This product has so many benefits to it! I am currently using it to help keep my nutrition in check as I am dealing with lymes disease. You mix the green powder with 4-6oz of a non carb drink. To be honest, it isn't very tasty! It tastes 'green' that's for sure! If they had this in a pill form, it would be a lot easier to want to take. I mix it with orange juice and drink it quickly! The benefits outweigh the taste though :)
