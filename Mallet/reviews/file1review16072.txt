review/text: I use Calm after a workout when I know I am going to be really sore. Its a natural pain reliever and works wonderfully. Just be careful because it is a bit of a laxative, which I don't mind but know that before you take too much. I drink it before bed most nights, especially after working out and it helps me get to sleep. We also put it in the bath with my granddaughter to relax her and she smells delicious afterwards. Love this stuff!
