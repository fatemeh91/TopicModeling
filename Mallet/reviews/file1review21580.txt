review/text: I've purchased other products from Interactive Health, including the iJoy (which is AMAZING compared to other massage chairs I've tried), and their Ottoman 2.0 (which hits the spot on the calves wonderfully).I bought this in hopes to get the same quality and effect as I have from their other products, but have been disappointed. The two massaging handles on either side of the pillow massage the sides of my neck well, but doesn't hit the back of my neck at all--and that's where my sore spot always tends to be at! The "pillow" itself is hard and can be uncomfortable, so you have to position your head carefully in order to really relax.I wouldn't recommend purchasing this massager at its expensive price. However, should you find this massager on sale, it's a decent product. I'm still in the pursuit of a more effective neck massager, though...
