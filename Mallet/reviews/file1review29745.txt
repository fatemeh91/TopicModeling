review/text: I used the Lasinoh breast pads, which were disposable but since I plan on breastfeeding a while, I felt the expense would add up. These absorb okay but my milk has through through the pad or right out of the pad many times since I am forced to be using them for a stretch of 6 hours. So in terms of absorbancy, Lasinoh has got them beat hands down. Lasinoh also were thinner and stayed in place much better. The only reason I am still using these is because I just put them in the wash every week and don't have to worry about buying a constant supply of breast pads. I imagine I would need to replace some of them but the turnover is much longer.
