review/text: "Mostly" means they don't give it enough credit. The directions clearly state it is not to be used for blood. I recently got blood on my shirt because I didn't notice my forearm was bleeding due to overzealous loving from a pet. I first wet the spots with Shout (I get no payment for this plug) and dabbed them alternately with a wet, then dry, wash rag. The the faded telltale stains remained. I applied the Tide toGo and the remaining stains disappeared instantly. I've used the stick many times at work to successfully remove mustard stains - yeah, I'm a sloppy corn dog fan.
