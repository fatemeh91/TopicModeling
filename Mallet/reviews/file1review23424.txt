review/text: I love this stethoscope! I bought this for nursing school and have been comparing it to others, most of the time Litmans, and have to say- this stethoscope is awesome! It has super comfortable ear pieces, has amazing accoustics, and have had people who can never hear out of stethoscopes say "Wow, I can actually hear out of that stethoscope!" You will be amazed, considering the price!
