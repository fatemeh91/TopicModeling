review/text: Here are the supplement Facts per soft gel for Cod Liver Oil "Lightly Lemon" and the Cod Liver Oil with "Low Vitamin A":Vitamin A: 150 IU (3% Daily Value)Vitamin D: 80 IU (20% Daily Value)Vitamin E: 2 IU (7% Daily Value)Omega-3: 230mgEPA: 85mgDHA: 100mgIf you buy the Carlson Cod Liver Oil "Super 1000mg", be aware that it has high contents of Vitamins A, D, and E which can be toxic if you take too much:Vitamin A: 2000 IU (40% Daily Value)Vitamin D: 250 IU (63% Daily Value)Vitamin E: 10 IU (33% Daily Value)Omega-3: 240mgEPA: 90mgDHA: 120mgI believe the "Lightly Lemon" taste the best plus it has low Vitamin A and it gives you about the same amount of Omega-3. If you buy the "Super 1000mg" which Carlson recommends to take 5 soft gels per day, that means you will have 200% Vitamin A which is not good for your health. In my opinion, by swallowing the soft gel with water might be better than chewing the soft gel because the Cod Liver Oil is better absorbed in your stomach instead of the mouth.Also on the bottom of the bottle says best used by 2015, I bought this in 2011, so expiration is about 4 to 5 years.
