review/text: I'm happy with this sweeper. I have hardwood floors with a few large carpets, and I use this to keep my carpets clean in between vaccuming, because my 3-year old is terrified of the regular vaccuum, so I can't use that as often. There's actually not much to vaccum when I do, this sweeper works so well. I knocked off one star because it doesn't work as well on hardwood floors. I thought I might have problems with the handle, because it just sticks on with no screws, but I haven't, and I use this sweeper every day.
