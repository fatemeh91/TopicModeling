review/text: Having had a series of fantastic hot stone massages this last summer, I was hoping to at least approximate that experience at home. The stones in this set are tiny, they retain heat very poorly, and there are too few of them. The massage therapist recommended buying a large set of basalt stones and using a crockpot to heat them, and that's what I'm going to do.
