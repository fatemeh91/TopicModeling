review/text: We had heard that peppermint soap was good for dry skin, so we ordered a few different bars to try. I admit i liked the feel of this one most of all, as the almonds provide a very nice exfoliant and a pleasant aroma. However there needs to be a stronger peppermint scent to them. We ended up going with the soap that had the heaviest peppermint scent as that helps us wake up and get the blood flowing. Don't get me wrong, if you have a really good sense of smell you won't have a problem with this soap. I really enjoyed it and may get an occasional bar for the winter to help keep from itching so much due to our hard water.
