review/text: The reviews were great on this products, that is why I bought it.But when received mine in the mail and tried it out, It was completely useless, I think the worst 10 Dollars I have ever spent.It would not grip any hair of mine, the quality felt very poor, I had better experiences with tweezers from Walmart.Really disappointed.
