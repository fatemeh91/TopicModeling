review/text: I LOVE this facewash !!! It is gentle on the face and gets my eye makeup off as well. I have sensitive skin and this facewash has never irritated the skin on my face or eyes. There is not artificial fragrance in it. This is a product I have been using for about 5 or more years and stick with a good thing. Even though Dermalogica is expensive, I feel it is a value to purchase the bigger size as it lasts so long. I am 55 years old and have dryer skin as I age, and this product does not dry out my skin. I would highly recommend it !!!
