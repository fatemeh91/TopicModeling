review/text: This product has been extremely effective. I used it in hopes of preventing contipation, a comm side effect that commonly occurrs from taking narcotic pain medication which I had to take when I had rotator cuff surgery recently. This was a very painful surgery and recovery. The last thing I needed to deal with was additional discomfort. I recommend thus product for anyone needing an effective yet gentle cleanse, help establishing regular elimination pattern, or assistance combating medication side effects.
