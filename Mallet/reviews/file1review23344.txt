review/text: I have to say, I am very impressed by Duocal! We started using it back in May for my 3 yr old's chronic weight issues - Failure to Thrive for 18 months. I was very conservative about only putting in a teaspoon for an 8 ounce container of Pediasure. But then I started reading the directions and found out you can do 1 spoonful for every 2-3 ounces, so ... guess who added more?! Yep! And at my son's last weigh-in, he was ON THE WEIGHT CHART! Not only was he ON THE WEIGHT CHART, but he was also TENTH PERCENTILE! Yes!!!Now, I am not claiming Duocal did it all. It's the whole shebang, everything, that caused the weight gain. (And by everything, we are literally doing everything to battle Failure to Thrive ...) But Duocal was a part of the team and was likely one of the tipping point factors to break through the glass ceiling of weight maintenance and move us onward to gaining weight. So I am impressed and loving this stuff.By the way, please do not use without a doctor or nutritionist advising so.
