review/text: The rounded daily pillboxes are more comfortable in my pocket than my previous rectangular ones with sharp edges, and they snap shut tightly and stay shut (which isn't the case with some other pillboxes).Unfortunately, the tray that holds all 7 pillboxes has only shallow slots for each to rest upon, so even a gentle nudge or jostle of the table it's on, or to the side of the tray, will send all the pillboxes scattering. It's happened dozens of times already and is rather frustrating. If they'd get a better tray to hold the 7 boxes more securely, I would definitely give this weekly pill-minder a better rating.
