review/text: Be careful when you purchase this item. I purchased it to deal with my handfull of nighttime and morning meds. I wrongly assumed that the 2 compartments had separate lids, this was not the case, its just one big lid. This means that you cannot just open the pm side and empty it into your hand, you either have to cover the am side with something or pick the pills out.The pods are made of a flimsy feeling plastic. The tabs by which you open the lid are thin, so thin in fact that after filling each pod and using it for 2 days i have already broken 2 tabs.The concept is a good one, there are, however, better ones available.
