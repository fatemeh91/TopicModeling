review/text: I bought this for my husband who has had 2 neck surgeries within the last 4 years. He said that the collar fits perfectly and is very comfortable, but does not stay warm as long as promised. He warmed it in the microwave according to the instructions (making sure not to overheat it) and said that it lost all of it's heat in between 5 and 10 minutes. It was promised to stay warm for at least 20 minutes! He was disappointed because he said it would be perfect if it would just stay warmer longer.
