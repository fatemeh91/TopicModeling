review/text: Well, I got it at a local store for $2 after using a $1 coupon, and although I had read the previous reviews, I figured it just couldn't be as bad as so many others had claimed. And it's not ... if you don't mind oily lip smudges and melted on cheese and random streaks. I agree with the other reviewer who suggested it might be better to use no detergent at all than this stuff. How they ever got away with marketing this is beyond my imagination. If you put the dishes in perfectly clean, they will come out that way, but otherwise you will not want to eat off your own dishes. If I were Amazon, I'd take this stuff off the site entirely.
