review/text: I bought this heated footbath for my man who suffers from pain in his feet and legs due to nerve damage. He loves it and I enjoy using it too. It gets really hot, which is very therapeutic. It is made well, very sturdy. The jets work great, and the pumice is nice for sloughing off dead skin. I had been searching a while for a quality HEATED foot spa, and I highly recommend this one.
