review/text: I have used the Gillette Fusion razor since it first came out. I really like the shave I get and the blades are comfortable and fast to use. With 5 blades I don't have to shave the same spot on my face multiple times, the first stroke gets it done right. This eliminates razor burn for me and results in a more comfortable shave.I like how the blade assembly follows my face and provides a good shave by keeping the blades at the right angle and in full contact with my skin. I also like having the one blade side for trimming my mustache and side burns. The lubricating strip is a nice feature as it improves the gliding motion of the blade head and also acts like a blade wear indicator. I get a lot of use out of these blades as they seem to me to last longer than other brands and blade designs.Out of all of the types of razors I have used for many years, there is no comparison to the Gillette Fusion. I even hate to use another brand or razor because I am so used to the comfort of this design.
