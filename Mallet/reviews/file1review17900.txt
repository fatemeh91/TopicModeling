review/text: When exercising, I was having trouble breathing through my nose. I tried these strips. WOW! What a difference!! I then tried them for sleeping. It has made sleeping easier because I don't breathe through my mouth and wake up with a dry mouth anymore.The strip will feel funny at first. Though it doesn't take long until you forget it's on your nose, and you must remember to remove it.
