review/text: I rate this poorly because it does not fit my toothbrush. I thought "oral-B" meant it would fit my brush, and that "sonic" referred to the type of head. I did not see anything that said "this brush head only fits the sonic style oral-b" and because all the models I have ever had and the models my friends and family have take the same brush heads. Whenever I buy Oral B heads in a store they fit my toothbrush. Therefore, I will describe this site and/or this brush "not user friendly". If not all your heads fit all the models, you should make it clear. This was a big waste of time and money for me so other consumers be forewarned. I saw the high rating on this product and that made me trust the purchase. I am pleased to lower the star ratings on this to warn other customers. From now on I will buy tooth brush heads in a store even though that is less convenient for me.
