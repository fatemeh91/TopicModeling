review/text: I have been using an oral B rotating brush head for several years. This sonicoral B is by far superior. I have been using it for about a month and my teethare almost to a point of "dental hygienist" clean. It has a timer which ishelpful plus cuts off if brushing an area too hard. Love this brush!!
