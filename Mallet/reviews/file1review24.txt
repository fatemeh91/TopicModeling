review/text: After almost a decade on various medications to relieve my anxiety I was tired of relying on and paying for medications. I did research on GABA as a stress reliever and started taking it. First on an as needed basis, and now every day. GABA along with a B Complex vitamin have changed my life around, and for the first time in almost 10 years, I am off of prescription meds!! Back in October I spent 4 weeks out of state to take care of my dying father. Even though it was incredibly difficult and sad, I was able to keep it together without medication. GABA taken at night promotes a restful sleep and together with B Complex has given me a new found relaxation and peace.I do not recommend that anyone takes themselves off medication without their physicians ok - especially for severe depression or overwhelming anxiety. But I highly recommend that people experiencing excessive stress or anxiety issues give Kals GABA 750mg a try along with a quality B complex vitamin
