review/text: I actually use this product on a regular basis, only in a different scent. I find that definitely goes on clear even though it is white. It doesn't rub-off onto clothing. The odor protection is excellent. The antiperspirant protection is only about average, however. After about five minutes of moderate exercise, the product fails at being an antiperspirant.
