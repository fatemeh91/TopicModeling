review/text: This is a terrific supplement for keeping joint pain at bay, with the added benefit of healthy hair, skin, and nails.I've been taking MSM for at least a decade (started it after a horse-related injury) and I usually useJarrow Formulas MSM Sulfur Powder, 2.2 Pound, just mixed in plain water & I occasionally pair it withJarrow Formulas JarroSil, Activated Silicon, 2 Fluid Ounce (60ml), which I think improves the absorption (I've noticed that my hair definitely grows faster when I use both Jarrosil AND MSM).These tablets are large but easy to swallow & I like the convenience of the tablets (1000 mg each). It's easy to adjust your dose based on your joint's needs for the day. I definitely can tell that my flexibility is improved when my MSM levels are optimal and I would POSITIVELY recommend this over any NSAIDS (ibuprofen, Tylenol, etc.). In my opinion, this is a MUCH safer anti-inflammatory (basically, it's natural, odor-free sulfur). Just be aware that supplements like this rarely give "immediate" results; it will probably take a few days of beginning MSM to begin reaping the rewards and several weeks of use to see the changes to skin and hair. And, start with a low dose and gradually work your way up to avoid any chance of stomach upset.Jarrow's quality control is excellent, in my book; highly recommended!
