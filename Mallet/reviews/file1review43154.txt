review/text: The bottle says it smells like Ylang Ylang. Now I personally have never seen, touched, or otherwise experienced a ylang ylang plant but if I were to imagine what it would look like based on the smell of this shower spray I'd guess it crawled on all fours and wears a diaper. I'm not sure what it is, but something about this scent reminds me of a baby or a nursery.Beyond the odd scent, it works rather well. I started with a clean shower and used the product after after shower, misting the walls and curtain. The curtain has remained mildew and residue free as well as most of the tub, and the faucet and other chrome fixtures have remained shiny and clean much longer than normal.I also appreciate that I'm not filling my bathroom with chemical fumes every day.
