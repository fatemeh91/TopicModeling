review/text: Bought one of thse brushes years ago that has a black handle and still have the brush this day, using it EVERY DAY to clean my coffee pot, parts and cup at work. Bought this new Oxo brush with the white handle to use at home and left it in the hot dish water and found that the bristles are so soft that they warped on one side just sitting in the dish water. In any case, this brush is absolute junk compared to the old Oxo and the company ought to be ashamed.
