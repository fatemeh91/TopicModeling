review/text: I also did come across an National Institutes of Health laboratory review [...]which concludes that the Omron models 705cp and 711 are "suitable for clinical use". Also, that most companies use different algorithms in their computations. This means that many, if not most, other models vary immensely in their readings. Wrist units are less accurate than upper arm units. I have so far found nothing qualifying any wrist unit for clinical use. For 50 bucks at Walmart, I'd be perfectly happy if anything this consistently accurate, this cheap, lasted 6 months of everyday use, let alone a year. On the bright side, at least I know I'll outlive it :-p
