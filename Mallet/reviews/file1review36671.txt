review/text: I love the Irish Spring Brand Soap. I remember the familiar green spring scent from when I was a child. Being able to Test Drive the sport scent was a treat. The soap has such a pleasant and delightful smell. It's also anti-bacterial for added protection against bacteria. The soap is smooth as silk going on and washes off like water. It's a little harsh on sensitive skin, but otherwise I really like this soap. It's a brand and scent that everyone in my family can agree on.
