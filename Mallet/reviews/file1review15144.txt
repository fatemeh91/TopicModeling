review/text: I have tried a lot of energy bars and I have to say, Balance cookie dough is the best I have ever tasted. (I'm not saying all the Balance flavors are as good as this one- I have tried and not liked other Balance bars.) But the cookie dough flavored one is awsome. It is covered in chocolate so it's like eating a chocolate bar, except with a lot more nutritional content! Try this bar if you really want a great tasting energy bar.
