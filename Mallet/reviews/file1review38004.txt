review/text: I am an ERT member at work where we have had AEDs for over 3 years. I can state with certainty that they are incredibly simple to use and offer the most significant increase in survivability should someone suffer cardiac arrest. In our training however, there is one important point stressed: The machine will deliver a shock only in the case of fibrillation. If the heart is stopped completely these units do not pack enough energy to offer the kind of jolt you seem to see at least twice on every medical TV show. That is a minor limitation, AEDs are a critical part of the four step approach mentioned in another review. 1)Early activation of EMT (911) 2) Early CPR3) Early defibrillation 4)Early advanced life support. As a citizen you can easily accomplish the first 3 with minimal training and relatively minimal dollars. $1500 is still spendy for something you may never use. If possible you might pool your money with neighbors or family and come up with a plan to keep the AED accessible to all. It might not be used to save your life, but it will feel just as good if it saves someone elses.
