review/text: These Gillette blades are substandard They pull your beard and are too painfull to use. Comparing these blades with the same Gillette blades purchased locally I find the following differences: 1) The lub strip from the local ones are much more slippery.The blades purchased on line, they hardly have any lub they appeare to be hard plastic. 2) The orange coating is coming off in large pieces I have never had this happen with the ones purchased locally. 3) The edges on the online ones appeare to have a extra honing process that is not evident on the locally purchased ones. In my opinion these blades are either seconds or knockoffs!
