review/text: i just received my dr scholls foot massager yesterday and am very glad i purchased it. i asked for this item for christmas but hubby got the wrong kind. he got me one of those with heat and massage but has a hard surface top with bumps on it. i did try that one out but found it to be too hard for my feet. i suffer from several foot ailments and when im really hurting, i can barely touch them to hand massage them, much less place them on a hard surface. i returned that item and bought this one instead and im so glad i did! its SO soft and warm.you can turn on just the heat, or just the massage, or both, or neither! if youre looking for a soft pillow for your feet that can massage them and warm them or just give the a soft place to rest, then you should buy this product!the one thing that it doesnt do is allow you to control the massage speed. it alternates from a high to low speed automatically but theres no manual control to do that yourself.one good note to point out, the cover on this comes off so it can be washed. thats not mentioned in the description and was one thing i was hesitant about when trying to decide.overall, im happy that i purchased this item. my feet are being comforted by it as im writing this review!
