review/text: Exact replacement for my Norelco razor, but somehow I do not feel the same smoothness of my shave as the blades that came originally with the razor.On a scale of 1-10 the replacement blades were 8 in comparison.Don't know if there is a manufacturing lot difference betweem OEM and replacement spares. Otherwise good value for money though I must say they are expensive, but this is how manufacturers make money.... make the product lower cost them make the money on the spares to keep it going.
