review/text: My husband and I have been using this kit for almost a year, and we love it. It's easy to use and easy to clean. He has medium thick hair and we have had no problems. I have also used it on my Mother-In-Law's fine hair, and it worked beautifully. I've recently purchased another kit for my Father as well. I expect it any day. This kit is definitely worth every penny!
