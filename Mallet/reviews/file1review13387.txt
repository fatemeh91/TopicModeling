review/text: I purchased 3 of these for my disabled child who wets through significantly overnight, even with a depends on. After only 3 months of washing and drying, the waterproof lining has already started becoming separated from the outer layer of the underside of the pad - or getting stuck to the inner layer? Either way, where that one inch spot is ripped, any urine will leak through the pad and onto the sheets. Bought same size pad in the "Original blue max" brand last month and can already see they are more durable...and they were $3 less each!
