review/text: This is a nice clipper set, but the combs are plastic (and you know what will happen if Fido or Muffy get their jaws on them), and the blades are non-adjustable.It's good value for the price and fits the hand well, but in my estimation works well for a small dog like our Cairn Terrier, but if I had a large dog I would want a more powerful set. It comes in a nice permanent plastic box, and has a good set of scissors with it. It's fairly quiet and didn't terrorize our dog.If you have a large dog or a dog with a really thick coat like a Chow Chow, then I would recommend you invest in the more expensive professional model. The demonstration DVD, while not elaborate, is very helpful, and my wife and I got an acceptable result in our first attempt. Practice (on our part and our dog's) should really improve the result.
