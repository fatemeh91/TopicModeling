review/text: [...]This product, while smelling very chocolaty, tastes like unsweetened baking cocoa which isn't good by any means.I've been using protein powder for at least 7 years now and use it everyday with breakfast. I know protein powder can taste pleasant if not good. There are better products available for those who plan on using a product every day and don't care to take the time to blend in extra ingredients as I do.
