review/text: I really don't get what everyone's complaining about when it comes to the smell of this product. It smells like baby powder, which last time I checked wasn't a disgusting aroma that made people want to flee. The scent is strong, so I always spray right after the shower, so that the bathroom has a little bit of time to air out before someone goes back in. Even if they do, however, it's natural, so other than the strong scent, breathing it in won't hurt you.I can't vouch yet for the effectiveness of this product. I've been using it for a week or two and so far haven't seen much, if any, improvement in our grout. There seem to be some spots that are brilliantly white, while others are still black or red (gross!). I'll write another review if the product shows improvement over time, but for now I'm not sure.
