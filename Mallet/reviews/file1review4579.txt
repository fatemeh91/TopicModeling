review/text: Gillette has hit a 3 run homer over the wall with this razor. I've been using it a month now and it is perfect in all respects. The only safety razor I've ever owned which has not caused even one knick, it is very smooth and the separate single blade for sideburns and under the nose is a great feature. Absolutely the best razor and blade combination ever conceived by man. Some may complain about the price, but as in most things in life, you get what you pay for.
