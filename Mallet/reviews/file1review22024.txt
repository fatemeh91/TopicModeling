review/text: My daughter gets wasted every time she gets sick. She gets the most horrible coughing spasms, causing a lot of lost sleep (for everyone) and major frustration for her. This is the only thing that will calm her cough long enough for her to be able to get some sleep. Like another one said, it's not a miracle product, in that it will cure your ailment. It just allows you the much needed break from the coughing, that prevents you from getting the rest you need. Not even regular cough medicine helps like this does. And I love that it's natural and not chemical.
