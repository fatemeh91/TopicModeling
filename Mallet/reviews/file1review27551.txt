review/text: Have tried all kinds and and all flavors of whey proteins that are out there. The gold standard whey works great for my digestive system (I am trying to gain and go thru like 13-15 scoops a day). Have seen great results, love the taste, the price and the results. Banana is my fav and I think least 'powdery' of all the other flavors when you are mixing it with water. Be sure to use an electrical blender though.
