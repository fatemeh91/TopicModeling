review/text: I thought twice about spending so much for a pair of tweezers, but I decided to go for it after so many years of blunt tweezers that couldn't easily get small splinters. To my delight, these tweezers were just what I have always wanted. They are needle sharp, have perfectly alligned points, and can reach anything small. I presume they would be good for ingrown hairs, but I will use them for tiny splinters. One warning: I would definitely not give them to small children because I could imagine accidents. Otherwise, these tweezers are in that too unusual category of products that do just what they are supposed to do--making them a real pleasure to own.
