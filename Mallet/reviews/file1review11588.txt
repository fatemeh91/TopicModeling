review/text: I have used alkaline Duracell batteries for years and have always been satisfied with their quality. Recently I purchased a number of these rechargeable NiMH batteries and have been sadly disappointed. They won't hold a charge! The only way that I have found them usable at all is to take them from the charger and use them right away - otherwise they are dead before they get started. Sorry, Duracell, but you have really hurt yourself - and your faithful customers - with this poor product. Even though I have a number of these and they have been used almost not at all I will likely toss them out and buy some other brand that will work when I need them.
