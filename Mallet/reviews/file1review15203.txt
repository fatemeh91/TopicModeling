review/text: My whole family loves balance bars as a quick way to get a breakfast start when there isn't a lot of time. We used to get them at Trader Joes. My youngest son and myself love the mocha chip the best. My other two like them too but I can get them a couple of other flavors. They stopped carrying any of our favorite flavors at Trader Joes. I decided to try a find them directly- online. When I did they came up on your site which we consider reliable and trust worthy and you had a good price and shipping deal. So we can't miss. Just don't buy too many at once so we don't get them too stale. The first shipment seemed like they may have been on the truck awhile. But we love them and have orded on 3 occassions and plan to again.Thanks.Lisa
