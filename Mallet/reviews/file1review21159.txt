review/text: This is the only heating pad I have found that gets hot enought to really help if you have chronic muscle pain. I have one that I have been using for years. Inside the pad the heating wire is looped around pieces of lead and it has 3 fusible links that will melt if it overheats. That never happened but over the years the connections at these broke on my old pad - easy enough to fix if you dont mind a little soldering and sewing. I have fixed my old pad a couple of times and am still using it but just bought a new one since my daughter has started using the old one. For me this pad is better than anything and I have used them all.
