review/text: This product works incredibly well. A family member was having hip replacement surgery and needed the safety of grab rails for the bath and others. Problem being who wants to bolt a bunch of rails all over the bathroom?The suction cups on this work as you'd expect, I'm over 200lbs and this can take most of my weight. I never did pull it off the wall.It even works on smoothish walls/painted sheetrock, outside of the actual bathtub. Pretty amazing.It has trouble on tile, the suction cups of course can't handle a grout line, but that's really to be expected I think.For a temporary solution withut marring the walls, this cannot be beaten. And it's only $20something.
