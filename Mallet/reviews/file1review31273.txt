review/text: It's exactly like I remember it from when I was a child. I started taking it when I felt a cold coming on and it knocked it right out of me!. As for the taste... I think it's pretty good. Just make sure you shake it well each time to mix it up, or you might end up with too much cod liver oil on your spoon. Now that's nasty. I'm about to order some more Father J. Love it!
