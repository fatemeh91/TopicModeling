review/text: Compared to other epilators, this one is great at removing hair. It has two heads, so it seems to be twice as fast. The little roller bar that is meant to dull the sensation does dull the prickly feeling, but for me epilators are not painful anyway. Also, it got most of the little hairs that the other Emjois often miss. The heads pop out very easily, so this is the easiest to clean of any epilators I have used.Now the down side. Terrible ergonimics! It is very short, about half as long as other epilators, and very wide and squat, since it has two heads. The cord is placed right on the side of the squatty little thing, so it is always in the way. There are no thumb grips or any other things that might help. I found that the cord got in the way, especially for the underarms and bikini areas. I dropped the thing three times in one session, and kept getting my fingers in the way of the tweezer heads. If it were not superior in hair removing abilities, I would return it due to poor ergonomics. If you have any kind of grip problems, or large hands, I can't imagine you would be able to use this. Go with the Braun silk epil, it works about as well, and you can get a grip on it, or the Emjoi Gently Gold Caress, which is rechargeable. Don't give up on epilators because of this poorly designed little thing.Emjoi, fix this design and you will have a great product.
