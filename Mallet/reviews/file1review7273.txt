review/text: On the plus side: I wanted a foot spa that truly kept the water warm. This spa does this by recycling the water while reheating it. The jets are adjustable, moveable and strong. The motor is quiet and it doesn't bother my husband while we are watching television. There is a plug for easier emptying. On the negative side, it is one of the more expensive foot spas on the market. It is bulky and heavy to move around especially when filled. The foot rollers on the bottom don't really do anything and could be eliminated in my opinion. You can't use anything but plain water per the manufacturer. Mine did arrive with a small crack in the blue water shield but I didn't want the hassle of sending it back as overall, I like the machine and my feet come out of it feeling great. I need that as I'm a nurse who works 12 1/2 hours shifts on my feet.
