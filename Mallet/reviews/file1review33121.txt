review/text: This product works especially well when you have that slight tingle in your throat and it's probably going to turn into a full blown cold/flu...the bottle says to take 6 pills=one serving size. I really really do feel like it gets you out of the woods. It doesn't seem to work if you are already full blown sick. Every one of my family members uses this product..It's worth every penny...about $20 to be exact..they carry it at my local Sprouts.
