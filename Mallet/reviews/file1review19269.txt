review/text: My infertility specialist recommended this product for my husband after my first IUI. After 1st month of taking the vitamin, the doctor ran a test and was happy with the result. 80% of the sperm were alive and they are moving at a 3 (the doctor said 3 or 4 is the best). However, we didn't get pregnant this month. My husband continued to use it for the 2nd month. At the end of the 2nd month, the doctor was REALLY thrilled with the lab result. 90% of the sperm were alive and they were moving at a 3+. This is my 3rd IUI, and I am pregnant this month!
