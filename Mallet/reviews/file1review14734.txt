review/text: I bought the item from VitaminLife because it said "In Stock". They sent an email that said differently. Basically, that the product was NOT in stock and may not be available from the supplier. I immediately cancelled my order. They say my card hasn't been charged. My advice, buy from a different company - one where the company can be relied upon to have what they claim. By the way, when I went back to Amazon to see about writing this, I see that the company is STILL claiming it's in stock. Buy elsewhere.
