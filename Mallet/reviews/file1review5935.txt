review/text: I am using this shaker for my Slim-Fast shakes, which use 8 oz of fat-free milk and ~1 oz of powder. The lid is tight, the milk stays cold (inside of an insulated lunch bag), and the powder is contained. Everything cleans up easily, no clumps of powder in my drink, and the 'ice wand' is great! I'm going to buy at least one more. The Fit & Fresh Chilled Shaker is exactly what I wanted.
