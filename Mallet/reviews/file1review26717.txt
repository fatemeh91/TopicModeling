review/text: I'm always afraid to buy a huge quantity of something to have it taste bad (hello, CostCo). This Double Rich Chocolate tastes pretty good and isn't as chocolate-y as I would have expected, which is good for me. Like anything powder-based, you can add more water for less flavor and less water for more.The little spoon was kind of hard to find in the huge tub of powder, but I used chopsticks :]
