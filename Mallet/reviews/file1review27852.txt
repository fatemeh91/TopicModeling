review/text: I'm now over half-way through my 2nd Double Rich Chocolate 5.15 pounder and in a month or so I'm sure I'll be on my 3rd. Occasionally I try to research the best protein for a pre or post-workout snack, but my brain usually starts hurting and I have to lay down. The consensus at least seems to be that protein isolates are the most effective form of protein--and this stuff is mostly just that, with some whey concentrate and whey peptides blended in as well. I figure that covers the bases a bit. And it's got those amino acids you're also craving. Whatever. In the last 6 months I've added ~100 lbs to my squats/deadlifts and ~50 to my bench. I attribute this mostly to a new 80/20 workout program I'm trying, but obviously nutrition must be playing some part, and I am gulping down a protein smoothie daily. The same smoothie too. The exact same smoothie for weeks and weeks and weeks. I think that speaks for the taste. This has probably already been posted but my recipe is a banana, 1 protein scoop (sometimes 2), 1 tbsp of peanut butter, 2 cups of milk, and a splash of coffee (if its handy), blended up with a hand mixer. Every day. It was pretty delicious months ago and it's only now starting to bore me, so I might move on to Vanilla for my next tub and do the standard strawberry, banana, milk & honey thing. In my opinion, chocolate protein and strawberries do not mix. Oh yeah, this stuff dissolves pretty completely which is nice, although my Kitchen Aid hand mixer is pretty mean. On the rare occasion I'm spoon-mixing, I get a little bit of the protein globs which feel weird swallowing and cement themselves to the side of your cup. The only real complaint I have about ordering this is trying to find an existing flavor/size combination. Those drop-down selectors include a bunch of imaginary options. Somebody knows what I'm talking about, right?
