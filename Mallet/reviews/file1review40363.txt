review/text: I take airborne and lots a vitamin C when I get colds. Thought what the heck, why not give Gaia Herbs Quick Defense a shot. I didn't realize you take 2 pills 5x a day. Wow that was difficult. I have a hard enough time swallowing 1 pill one time a day. I tried it & have to say I didn't notice any difference. I did end up with a horrible cold. Lasted 2 weeks. I have to say though I started it on the night of the second day. Maybe that had something to do with it. Not sure, although probably won't try it again unless they come out with a better dosing instruction with less pills to take daily.
