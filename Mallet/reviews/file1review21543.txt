review/text: I was glad to find these replacement heads as they are becoming increasingly scarce. They are impossible to find locally anymore.In addition they don't fit the oral B handle as well as the originals, they are probably meant as a one size fits all arrangement, which they don't. Hence the three stars rating.After these wear out I'll probably have to find a new toothbrush altogether.
