review/text: I remember these nutrition bars from when I was a kid and was thrilled to find out that they are still around! I'm not particularly a health nut, but I am concerned about the types of snacks that I feed my kids. These bars are a healthy alternative to much of the kids snacks out there which tend to be high in sugar and low in nutrition. My kids love them (think they are a candy bar), and I get to feel good about what they are snacking on. It's a win-win situation!
