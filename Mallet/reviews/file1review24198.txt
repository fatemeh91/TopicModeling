review/text: I drink several cups a day, sometimes decaf, sometimes regular. I haven't lost a single pound. I keep drinking it because I like the convenience and the taste. Would I recomend it to you if you really want to lose weight? Not a chance. It does curb my appitite for a few hours but again, I have seen no decrease in my weight and I actually do exercise two to three times a week.
