review/text: I cannot comment on the health benefits of this product - I have to trust the manufacturer that this is as good as it says it is. What I can comment on is that these pills are HUGE and difficult to swallow. The outside of these pills are a bit rough and are harder than all others that I've tried to swallow. I'm going through the bottle while alternating with other pre-natal pills but on the days that I have to take these I dread swallowing them. I normally do not have a problem swallowing any pills so believe me when I say that these are tough to swallow.
