review/text: I have tossed my sponges and use Oxo good grip brushes for household cleaning jobs. I have only had this brush a few days, but find myself using it constantly. It is perfect for cleaning the crud out of the seals in the garbage disposal, cleaning the burners of the stove and the vent hood, and all the other cleaning jobs that require getting into crevices. The brush can be put in the dishwasher, or easily cleaned by hand and soaked in a chlorox solution for a few minutes. This brush cuts my cleaning time in the kitchen by several minutes per task. It is definitely a good value for the price.
