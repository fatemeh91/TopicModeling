review/text: I have a fair amount of anxiety when I'm in big groups of people. Kava definitely helps reduce that anxiety. These pills are good because they don't cloud my mind too much. They do make me feel a little drugged up though (even one capsule! maybe i'm just particularly sensitive), but I'd rather feel slightly drugged up than really anxious. It's more subtle than illegal or prescription drugs, and it definitely works for me. The only downsides are that it will sometimes make me very hot after taking it, but that subsides, and that it might be a little too strong, but to combat that I can just take it earlier so the strong effects wear off.
