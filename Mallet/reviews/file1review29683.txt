review/text: I purchased 2 packs of these pads with my first child 4 years ago. I really liked them and with my second, I needed one more pack due to a few being lost in the years in between. They still come in a great washable mesh bag, but the new pads are smaller and using very different materials than my first sets. I do not like this new style,OLD Version:4.5" diameterPoly lace exteriorJersey knit interior (only negative- it feels wet quickly)Overall very absorbentMolds to breast shape to create a concave pad interiorNEW Version:~4" diameterPoly lace exteriorFlannel interior (positive- it doesn't feel wet)Thin and not very absorbentStays in a flat shape and doesn't mold to breast shapeThe only plus with this last set is the flannel interior. Overall I do not like the smaller size and don't think these are nearly as absorbent as the older sets that I have. I will keep these as my emergency pads while my older sets will remain my everyday choice.
