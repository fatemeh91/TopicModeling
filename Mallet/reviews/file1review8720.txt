review/text: You get what you pay for...always. You pay a little more at times but you get something that's worth the investment. This item is well worth the $$$ and I would always want others to give me a heads-up when something is worth the purchase (and the time to review the item).I use this cleaning tool to scrub my cutting board. It does the job and keeps it's shape. The bristles are firm and do a good job of cleaning.OXO Good Grips Corners and Edge Brush
