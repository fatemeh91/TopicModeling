review/text: I heard Dr. Norm Shealy recommend Perfusia-SR in a teleseminar interview. It seems to reduce my blood pressure about 20 points. In my understanding of the call and discussion of this formula, this particular brand is unique in that the L-Arginine is time-released. The metabolism of L-Arginine in the body is very fast, so time-release provides a steady benefit to the body.
