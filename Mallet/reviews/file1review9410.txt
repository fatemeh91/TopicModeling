review/text: I am horrible when it comes to remembering to take pills. I got an IUD a while ago because I could NEVER remember to take my pill. This has been a life saver - expecially since I now have to take an antihistamine every morning and a multi-vitamin. It is convenient to bring along on out of town trips and the containers are easy to open - great buy for the money.
