review/text: Picks up things just as good as the Bissell electric sweeper...lasts LONGER than it too. I had an electric one and it didn't even last me more than a couple months.PROS:Easy to empty outLightweightSweeps up dust, pet hair, and crumbs in just one sweepCONS:While sweeping, if you bump the sweeper into something hard, it tends to spit out what it just swept up. Doesn't happen often.
