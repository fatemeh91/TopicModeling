review/text: I would definitely recommend Dry Idea to friends and family. I was very pleased with this product. I didn't notice any white residue on my clothes like I get from many other products. I really like the roll-on liquid better than the sticks that I usually get. I was very surprised at how well it worked. In my experience, unscented deodorants sometimes don't work as well because they don't have the mask of a fragrance. I would buy this product again.
