review/text: Pros: Perfect size for Slim Fast shakes, the divider breaks up the powder and the separate powder keeper at the bottom allows me to mix when ready. Also wonderful for correct serving sizes of cereals.I love these cups. I originally had the Curve version and lost the chiller insert and it took me forever to find another one just like it. I agree with some of the other reviews about the double threading of the cap but after using these cups for years I have mastered the feel of when the top is on correctly. I tend to shake over the sink when I mix to make sure and have had no problem with leaks. I also use these to take cereal to work everyday allowing me to put the correct portion size of my cereal in the bottom while measuring the correct serving size of milk. All I have to do is pore in the bowls and I am good to go.
