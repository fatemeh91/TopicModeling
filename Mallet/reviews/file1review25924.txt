review/text: I've seen several poor reviews, saying the charge light comes on for 20 minutes and then goes off, without indicating a full-charge. This is true, if you're using it in another country. Amazon's description is somewhat misleading, as it says "travel," but doesn't specify that the travel must be in the US. You have to go to the manufacturers website, where they clearly inform the public this charger is only intended for use in the USA!!!If you use it as intended, it's a great product, with very innovate features (car charger, etc.).
