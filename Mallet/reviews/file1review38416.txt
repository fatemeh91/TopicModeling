review/text: I am so happy I went ahead with this purchase. I was so sick of shaving my legs and being spikey by the end of the day. I hated waxing as I would have to hide my legs for weeks while the hair grew to the required length. The Emjoi AP99 is the perfect solution for me. It seems faster to use than an older Emjoi I had a few years ago, and I love the shaver attachment for when you just need a final touchup. I don't even think it hurts and I have course thick, what I refer to as man hair on my legs. Too much information?:)
