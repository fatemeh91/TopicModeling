review/text: I first used ConvaTec's products while in the hospital, so when my father needed a good bodywash/shampoo product that was both gentle and easy to use, I ordered some Aloe Vesta bpdy wash and found it to be just as mild and easy to use. The minimal sudsing make it ideal for home care and left his skin noticeably softer. I would recommend for anybody who needs a good, dependable body wash. It works great for home care, whether it be sponge baths or cleaning babies with a warm, wet wash cloth. It's very economical too, as just a litte does the trick. Will ddefinately buy from the again, and the shpping was incredibly fast.
