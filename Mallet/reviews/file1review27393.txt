review/text: This is still my favorite protein next to their Pro Complex series, which I occasionally switch to for the higher protein content, depending on the training. Both the Gold Standard and Pro Complex lines blend, digest and absorb very easily and aren't all loaded down with sugar like CytoSport products (although they are sweetened with Sucralose). For my money, I want great quality, and when it comes down to it, you can't beat brands like Optimum Nutrition,BELDT - Force Thermogenic, MusclePharm, and MRI. Especially when locked into bouts of high-intensity training.I normally blend the Gold Standard double-chocolate with ice and water, but cheat days I'll toss in a couple scoops of sugar-free vanilla ice cream. Beats ANY Muscle Milk.
