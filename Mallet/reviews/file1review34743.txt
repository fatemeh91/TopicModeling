review/text: I am using this and it has worked better than the other natural deodorants (Tom's and one that begins with an A). I love the effectiveness but as a woman, the piney scent is overpowering and I have to spray in the bathroom then leave for a moment. I will happily try another Aubrey deodorant, though. Vinegar, baking soda and other natural remedies didn't work and had to be applied several times daily.
