review/text: I decided to try a sample-size of this cleanser from a local beauty shop. It worked so well, and we so gentle (on my dry, sensitive skin) that I wanted more! I ended up buying it full-price at a spa after a facial. HUGE mistake. It cost me like $75!!!Then I found it on here for $36!! What a pleasant surprise!! You only need a little bit, so the 8.4oz. bottle lasts for quite a while! Especially if you use the pre-cleanser first! (which I thought was total BS initially - but, in fact - is a HUGE help).It smells a tiny bit - a little weird, but not offensive - it's too subtle (and I have an overly sensitive sense of smell, so most probably wouldn't even notice). it's totally clear, so you don't have to worry about any artificial coloring and they definitely didn't use any fragrances.It gets my face nice and clean without drying out my skin - but, it also doesn't leave it oily. Perfect combo. Great stuff!! I'm sticking with it!I know that it may seem like BS but for those of you with dry skin like me, I'd get the pre-cleanser and hydro-booster with this. My skin has never looked better! :)
