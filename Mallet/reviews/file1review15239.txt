review/text: I thought these nutrition bars were quite good. I've tried nutrition bars in the past and have always been disappointed. These bars not only tasted good, but they actually filled me up. I'm a college student and a lot of times I don't have time to stop and eat a full meal between classes. These bars were perfect for an on-the-go burst of energy. I've already recommended them to my fellow roommates and they all enjoyed these bars as well.
