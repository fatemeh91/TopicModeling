review/text: This Thermometer seemed like a wonderful idea. Unfortunately, it didn't work as well as I had hoped. I tried this a couple of times when my baby was just a newborn. However, even though the package states 0-5 years this did not work for a newborn. She kept gaging on it because the nipple was too big. I didn't use it for quite some time but recently tried it again now that she is a bit bigger. She is used to a different type of pacifier so she wouldn't keep it in her mouth, which doesn't make for an accurate reading. I will give it this though, it does give me an idea of if I have anything to worry about, I tend to over react and think that she has a temperature, this will do a good enough job to let me know if she is fine or if I need to get out the dreaded &quot;traditional&quot; thermometer.
