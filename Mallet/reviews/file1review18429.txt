review/text: This breathalyzer, I'm convinced, isn't totally accurate. However, it does tell when you have quite a bit of alcohol in your system. So if the number is incredibly high, it does not mean you are that number but it does mean that you are probably unsafe to get behind the wheel of a car. What I also like is that anybody can use it. You don't have to put your mouth around it, simply blow air towards the reader. Not a bad product for the price.
