review/text: The guided imagery is excellent - I like the subliminal suggestions as well - have always found that they work. The music is excellent as well - extremely peaceful. Very well done. One just needs to relax let go and put yourself there. I noticed a difference immediately in an infection I have been fighting. I am so thankful there are people out there helping others with cd's like these.
