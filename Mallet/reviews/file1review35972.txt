review/text: I got this product as I ran out and needed a new supply. This was made by the same company I had originally so I thought ok cool. However, the color and flavor are not the same as what I've been using. It was a bit of a surprise since I have used this company's product for some time now... anyway, not entirely certain why the change and it threw me off a bit.... I'll have to see if there is a difference somewhere that I did not identify prior to purchase. Don't get me wrong... its a fine product but there is just something &#34;different&#34; about it that I can't place my finger on. Hope this helps
