review/text: Wonderful epilator. This is the FIRST TIME i have ever used an epilator and it is wonderful. I have very dark and coarse hair and it comes off very easily, that is, when it is the right length. To me, it did not hurt much at all. It feels as if you are getting a wax or plucking. In my opinion, tweezing hurts much much more. The epilator yanks the hairs out much more faster and easier. I have tried many forms of hair removal methods on my legs and this is the best one yet. I recommend this product very much to anyone in need of it. I call this a product in need due to many problems i have had with hair growth on my legs. No one likes hair on their legs and by using this product the hair is removed quickly. You will be left with redness on the areas used but that goes away within a couple of hours. To everyone, i RECOMMEND. Excellent product!!!!! Very happy customer...FINALLY A PRODUCT THAT WORKS!!!!
