review/text: Not much to add, just wanted to throw in another 5-star review. My package was not from this vendor and included 60, not 14, Formula 2 capsules. My package didn't have the audio either.You have to want to quit -- the program won't make you not want to smoke. But I'm in my 4th week now, and I can say I'VE FELT NO PHYSICAL COMPULSION TO SMOKE AND NOTHING IN THE WAY OF WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS. Admittedly, I was a light smoker -- strong cigarettes but rarely more than 6 per day; over many years, however; and I loved smoking!I waited until I had a mild cold, which cut down my inclination to smoke, and then started and followed the program. Another Amazon reviewer recommended also going to [...], and that was a good suggestion as it boosted my relatively weak motivation.
