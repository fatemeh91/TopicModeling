review/text: I needed an "intermediate" strength for computer work, as my current eyeglasses were either for distance (the top) or close-up reading (the bottom). I was getting constant headache and neck strain from trying to tilt my head back and getting up close to the computer screen so I could focus through the reading portion of my bifocals. These intermediate strength lens (intermediate for me, that is) let me sit a very comfortable 18 inches from the screen and focus with no problem. What a great change!! Thanks for a very economical solution to a widespread problem.
