review/text: The reason I purchased this brush is because I hand wash all of my dishes and needed something to get my Mason/Ball jars and other narrow mouthed containers clean. It works fantastically in that capacity. However, like a few other reviewers, I think it'd be a bit nicer if it had more bristles and/or that the bristles covered more of the brush head because it does leave bits behind every now and then.Not that I'm complaining. I'm not. Hand washing dishes can be a pain, and I generally use a sponge to wash mine. The problem with that is sponges tend to get kind of gross if you tackle the wrong substances with them. Like bread dough. Or batter. Now, rather than get my sponge all grody, I just whip this brush out & quickly scrub off all yucky/sticky/dried on food prior to washing the dish with my precious sponge. The yucky/sticky stuff rinses off very, very easily & this brush creates a pretty awesome lather if you use it in conjunction with dish soap.Needless to say, I've gotten much more use out of it than I anticipated, and I've come to rely on it where matters of dirty dishes and jars are concerned.
