review/text: Who knew? Internet orders work! I ordered 2 of these hard to find items just in case (given the shipping costs). The product came to Canada from the US but arrived promptly without issue. The batteries seem identical to the OEM batteries that had lost their umph. I have had the new batteries for a month and they seem to work fine. Looks like I managed to successfully extend the life of the headsets that they fit into. In retrospect, one battery would have been sufficient.
