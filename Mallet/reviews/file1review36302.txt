review/text: It is the right length from what I can tell, but it seems like more hair is getting caught in the blades with this attachment on as opposed to my previous one. I've made sure to oil the shaver too. It's gotta be a bit of a fit issue. Can't really complain too much for a couple bucks.And FYI, it's black, not red.
