review/text: This product is unbelievable. I have not seen nor heard a mouse since plugging this bad boy in! Thank GOD!!! It is in the basement and works great! You can hear a slight high pitch noise if you stand right next to it, but that is it. We have 5 dogs and 2 cats, it does not bother any of them. Thank you for a great product that works!!!
