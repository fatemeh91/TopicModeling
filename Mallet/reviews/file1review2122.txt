review/text: You won't find a better cleaner for your coffee pot. I worked many years with different types of coffee pots and NEVER found a better pot cleaner than Dip-it! I would recommend this above all other home remedies. The best way I found to use this cleaner professionally was to put this in the basket of the percolator as directed on the box, then run the coffee pot according to regulations on making pot of coffee (except you are using the dip it in its place). When brewing is complete, turn pot off and wait 15 minutes. Using a bottle brush was the inside of the pot and the inside of the spout. Dump the pot out until empty then fill with cold water until fullest line of amount of coffee that could be made in your pot size. Brew that water until perk light comes on. Then unplug and wait until cool enough to safely dump water and finish washing pot as usual. It is time to shine the outside of your pot with window cleaner. Enjoy your next cup of fresh coffee from your beautiful sparkling pot. This cup of coffee will taste as good as your very first cup did when you purchased this pot. ENJOY!
