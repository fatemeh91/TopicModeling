review/text: This has been one the greatest tools for stretching my neck, shoulder, and back muscles. An inexpensive method for a tool that lasts forever. I have a chronic pinched nerve at C6 that frequently refers pain to my left back shoulder and I use the Back Buddy to put pressure and stretch that muscle. I also use it on my neck muscles that flank my spine. I highly recommend using it on a regular basis if you carry your tension in your neck, shoulders, and back. I've been using it for a couple of years now; whenever I go on a trip for even one day, it goes with me too. A good buddy to have; no pun intended.
