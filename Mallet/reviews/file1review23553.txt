review/text: My Wife has been searching brick and mortar stores for about a year for a good mirror to help with her makeup application. All were either too cheap or too expensive. After searching thru the extensive Amazon mirror selection I settled on the Infiniti by Conair BE86. She is very happy with all aspects of this one. Quality of the delivered product was excellent: nice heavy chrome surface, touch type 3 position lighting power adjustment and good quality, clear mirrors (plain, 10X and spot). Her only complaint is due to our bathroom layout, not the mirror. Namely, we had no room at a convenient location for a wall mounted type so she has to bend over to get the right distance from the mirror. We may experiment with a stand of some kind to set the mirror pedestal upon.
