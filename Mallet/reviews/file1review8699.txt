review/text: I have plenty of Tweezerman tweezers, these are by far the worst. The product was as described, but as far as tweezers go stay away if you're using these on yourself (especially if you have fine hairs). It requires a lot of pressure to grab the hair, and it's really difficult and uncomfortable to do it on yourself. I'd recommend every and any other model of Tweezerman tweezers over these.
