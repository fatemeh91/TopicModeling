review/text: It works great!Let me start by saying that this unit is not cordless, although it is a good length. All the pictures I have seen show it without the cord. Turning it on is the scariest noise in the world. It sounds like some sort of torture device but it really does work once you get brave enough to actually put it onto your skin. It is not for fine hair. It will just break the hair but if the hair has a thickness to it, it will pull it out by the roots. It's best to take a warm bath/shower before to open up the pores so you don't feel the yanking as much. It also hurts less if the hair is not too long. A few days growth after shaving is best. If you have long hair make sure to put it in a ponytail before you begin, that is if you want to keep the hair you have on your head! You will have redness afterwards and it does hurt but you do get used to the sensation of having the hair ripped out by the roots. I use hydrocortisone cream afterwards to soothe the redness and the stinging and that seems to help. I have not been brave enough to use it on my armpits but I'm sure that I will. It's a bit hard to use on my shin bones and knees probably because there is not a lot of skin to press the unit against. I also find it hard to use in the bikini area simply because the head of the unit is very large. The shaving attachment is great too, but be careful with the trimmer, it is sharp. Hope this helps all of you that have been on the fence about purchasing this epilator! I will never use a razor again!
