review/text: Rosivin Rhodiola is helping me more and more. I take antipsychotic medication that was making me very, very tired and lethargic. I was needing to sleep 13 hours a day sometimes and wake up feeling tired still. Through out the day I was feeling drained. Since taking the Rosavin I am slowly, steadily yet surely getting better. I feel different now. Have more energy and am getting by on 7-8 hours of sleep again. I highly recommend it.
