review/text: This product has been a god send to me. For years I have suffered from constipation. I have typically resorted to laxatives which leave me with a terrible cramping feeling and sometimes don't work at all. After I tried this, I will never use another product again. It worked to relieve my constipation without any cramping or negative side effects. I found a lower doseage than the recommended amount was more than adequate for me, so that is something I believe that may vary for each individual, but overall I can not say enough good about this product. I love it and will recommend it to anyone having issues with irregularity or simply wishing to do a bowel cleanse without going to the expense or extent of having a colonic performed.
