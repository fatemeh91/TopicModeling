review/text: I have used this tea for several months and find that it does help me maintain weight. But I am a bit worried about the strong smell of insecticide which was present in several shipments. This odor not only came from the package itself, but was equally strong in the tea that I brewed. To be sure it was not an overreaction on my part, I asked someone else, "What do you smell?" The response was "bug spray." This box of tea was not the first time this has happened. Several times before I noticed the same smell, but stupidly continued to drink the tea. In fact, my daughter refused to drink it saying it smelled like bug spray. So beware.
