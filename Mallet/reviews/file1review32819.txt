review/text: The shake tasted a lot better than I had thought it would. I tried the strawberry a few years ago and hated it so I had threw this product out of my mind completely. Then I saw that they had a french vanilla flavor.. and since I usually buy a french vanilla cappicinno every day, I figured that this would be a good substitute. It tastes very sweet to me and reminded me a lot of vanilla cake batter. I haven't tried mixing it with anything but skim milk, but it doesn't seem necesarry to me. I like to drink them around 6pm so that they keep me from snacking late at night bc not only do they keep me full but they satisfy my sweet tooth. I haven't weighed myself since I ordered them.. but I'll update this review when I do. I'm deffinately a fan!
