review/text: At work we're all too lazy to plug in the loud heavy vacuum cleaner, and every bit of dirt shows up on our carpet, so we bust this thing out all the time. If you're complaining about how its built, look who built it. I put it together and its sturdy, to the people who keep saying the handle falls off, try graduating kindergarden.
