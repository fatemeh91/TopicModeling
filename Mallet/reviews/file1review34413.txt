review/text: We got tired of the thicker gels such as KY because they don't stay wet and because they get a bit sticky after a short time. We tried the Wet Platinum and WOW! A dab will do you with this stuff. It is very thin, but it makes everything it touches slippery and it stays that way. Surprisingly, however, it washes easily with soap and warm water. The only negative I can think of has to do with the bottle. It says on the label that the bottle may leak unless it is stored in an upright position. Since I usually store those types of things in the drawer of my nightstand, this is an issue. Maybe I'll just buy smaller bottles in the future.
