review/text: Two of these in the house have worked pretty flawlessly for months. No, it won't turn a mold-fest into a sparkling clean shower. Duh. But it does a bang-up job of keeping a clean shower or tub clean, with regular use. Just don't change the batteries when the thing is wet, and it works great. Not sure how people are burning up so many batteries in these. Mine has gone through one set in 5 months, and that's using it at least once a day.
