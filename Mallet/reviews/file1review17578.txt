review/text: I grow light, soft facial hair as opposed to the manly stubble you would see on television commercials, so finding the right trimmer to keep my facial hair looking short and fashionable has been difficult. I have purchased several beard trimmers over the past few months, including the wahl 9818 $70 trimmer which I returned the same day it arrived.This little Remington mb-200 has worked out remarkably. Its solid, powerful, and the length guard cuts pretty close to the face without having to make numerous passes over the same area. It keeps me looking as though I have 3 days growth on my face 7 days a week, which is exactly what I am going for. And that's not even the shortest setting.I totally recommend this trimmer for its performance, extensive length settings, and the right price. I'm a Remington guy from here on.
