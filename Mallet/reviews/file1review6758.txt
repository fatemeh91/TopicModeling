review/text: I love my Back Buddy. I bought this because I have chronic pain in my right trapezius muscle near the shoulder blade from years and years of competitive swimming. This is almost an impossible area for me to reach on my own and the pressure needed on the area made it very hard work for my husband. The Back Buddy is awesome because I can get to the affected area whenever I want and apply the pressure needed to get relief of my referred pain (the tennis ball and corner methods pale in comparison). My quality of life has improved since purchasing it. I would recommend it to anyone suffering from hard to reach muscular back pain.Thanks for taking the time to read my review, and I hope you found it helpful in making a purchase decision.
