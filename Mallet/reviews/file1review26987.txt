review/text: This is one of my first protein-powder purchases from the Optimum Nutrition brand. I'm amazed how quickly ON's whey protein powder dissolved in a liquid. I usually add 1 serving of ON (24g protein) to a couple of ice cubes and soymilk or skim milk in a blender to make a delicious protein shake, and it keeps me filled and satisfied for a couple hours. I like its consistency and smooth texture; it doesn't have that extra "stuff" that you can detect and taste in other protein powders, likeCytosport Muscle Milk Collegiate, Vanilla Creme 5.29lbs. The reason for 4 stars? Although you can smell the vanilla ice cream flavor once the container is open, the vanilla intensity just isn't enough, especially when you mix it with water.
