review/text: I have been taking 1 tablet of this product 3 times daily as directed for a little over 4 years now. I make it a point to take those three doses roughly 5-8 hours apart as that seems to be the most effective regimen for reducing my inflammation and pain associated with chronic non-bacterial prostatitis. Following that routine (along with a twice daily enteric coated premium fish oil supplement) manages to reduce the formerly unbearable pain associated with my condition anywhere between 90-100%.Nothing else I have tried (and I have tried basically every type and dose of OTC pain killers, pollen supplements, other quercetin based supplements, etc., etc.) has significantly reduced my pain and inflammation. These tablets from Source Naturals simply work, and they do so at a fraction of the cost of the other "Activated Qercetin" supplements that are commonly directly marked toward prostatitis sufferers. I really believe I have tried about every prostatitis relief supplement currently in production and it is safe for me to say that this is by far the single most effective product I have ever found for this problem; it has truly given me my life back.p.s. This product also seems to significantly reduce the number and severity of allergies during the spring and fall months. Since I began using it I notice that I feel like I have a little more stamina during my workouts and I also feel like I get sick less often--likely in part due to the large dose of buffered (i.e, non-irritating) vitamin C that this product contains.
