review/text: I was very disappointed in the Now Foods Amino Complete.First of all, I was under the impression that Amazon was required to disclose allergy information. These capsules contain powdered milk in the form of whey powder. People who are allergic to milk or are avoiding dairy should not buy this product. Also they are in gelatin capsules instead of the more common cellulose capsules.I used these 3 times a day for 2 weeks and did not feel any benefits. I even tried opening the capsules and mixing it with water and it does not dissolve. I imagine it doesn't dissolve any better in your stomach.I ending up throwing away the rest of the bottle. This was a complete waste of money!
