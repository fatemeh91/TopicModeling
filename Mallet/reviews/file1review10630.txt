review/text: I recommend these if you want to check pH. Sometimes, in between colors for reading, but gets the job done. This is a good price, under $10. Fun to check pH of things like toothpaste, shampoo, HBA products, etc.It is good to eat an alkalizing diet like fresh fruits & vegetables. Lots of good books out there on the subject.
