review/text: For the first two weeks after my hip surgery I struggled to put on my own socks. My husband would help me, but he grumbled. This sock helper is amazing. I can put my socks on my self without pain (I am supposed to avoid doing anything that causes pain according to my surgeon and physical therapist). I would recommend this sock helper to anyone who is having a hip surgery or has difficulty putting on their own socks due to limited mobility, balance issues, or pregnancy.
