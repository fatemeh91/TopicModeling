review/text: [Bought more than a year ago.]After researching a while I settled with this. There are better products than this but at a different price level. I felt this is the best choice and it is. After a year of using it, it's still like new - gets a little hot and noisy after a while but that's just the way it is.I wrote a blog post about it, which I now think is funny! You will find it if you google "first time self haircut" with before and after pictures!
