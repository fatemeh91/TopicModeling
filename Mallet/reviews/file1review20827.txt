review/text: After thirty years, and five Norelco electric razors, I decided to live on the edge and try something new. This razor gives a much better shave than I've ever had from an electric shaver. While I don't believe that any electric will come quite as close as a blade, this is the best I've ever used.Now in regard to some of the negatives I've read in the other reviews, I have not experienced any of those problems. The razor is no louder than my last Norelco. The build quality appears very good, with exception to the plastic travel case. The auto cleaning works wonderfully. I've had the razor for ten weeks, using the auto clean every day, and the original cleaning cartridge is not empty yet. I expect I'll use three or four of the disposable cleaning cartridge per year, but for about a nickel per day a clean, sterile, and just plain good smelling razor is a bargain.I suppose I wouldn't have any credibility here if I didn't have a couple minor negatives to report. First, the cleaning/charging base is a bit larger than I expected. Next the wall plug is big and sticks out further than I would have liked. And finally, the cleaning cycle does make a bit of noise as the razor cleans and flushes itself. These a very minor complaints.Overall, I would not have taken the time to write this review if I hadn't been exceptionally pleased with the performance of this product. Thanks for reading!
