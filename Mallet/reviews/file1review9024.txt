review/text: After reading the reviews I was afraid of what GV would taste like. I decided I was going to take a quick shot. I mixed 1 scoop along with 4 ounces of Cold water and 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar.......To My surprise it didnt taste as horrible as I imagined..It was totally easy to drink. I used a shaker bottle to mix it up fast.Yes it does smell like a fresh mowed lawn but the taste is easily doable.Amazon shipped the Item Super fast!!I have just started taking the stuff, so I cant comment on Energy or a miraculous life change, but I wanted to give quick feedback. I will let you all know if it changes my life lol
