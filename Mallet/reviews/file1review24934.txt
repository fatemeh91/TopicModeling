review/text: I started taking Fertilaid in September 2012 as a final self-help method before seeing a doctor. We'd been trying to conceive for almost 3 years so I was not optimistic as I'd taken other fertility supplements without success. I'd read all the rave reviews on Fertilaid and figured it couldn't hurt to give it a go. By December I'd run out of the 3 month supply - I'd read to take it for AT LEAST 3 months, so I bought another 3 month supply. I also got the CM product. I got my husband the men's Fertilaid - he took it intermittently, as most men do, they forget to take their supplements! A few days ago we got our first positive result! I'm sure a few other factors such as lifestyle change also contributed, but I attribute the positive result to Fertilaid as well. In addition to the positive result, the supplement also made me feel more energetic and really helped my acne skin and strengthened my hair and nails considerably.
