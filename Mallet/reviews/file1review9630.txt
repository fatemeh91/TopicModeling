review/text: The majority of anti-parasitic herb complexes available have so many extra synergistic herbs added that, unfortunately, often they can be compromising to our furry, four-legged friends. Eclectic Institute's "Intestinal Support" is a combination of black walnut, clove, and wormwood--and no other herbs. I keep my dog on a regular cycle of these pills, especially in the summertime. It is harder for me to tell their effect on her, but when our one cat had a lot of nasty red blotches all over his belly (which my hubby said reminded him of the blotches his one childhood cat had when it had internal parasites), I started giving him an opened capsule of the herbs in some 'tuna water' from a can of tuna every day, cycling the use of the pills similarly to that of our dog. Within a month or so the red blotches disappeared, and he stopped being so uncomfortable-looking/acting--wonderful! So I try to keep these pills on hand, as I have found them very useful in our household; it goes without saying that they are a nice choice for people interested in a more natural approach to ridding the body of parasites, as well.
