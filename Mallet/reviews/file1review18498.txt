review/text: I bought several concentrates from Dynamic Health and was always pleased, but they did not have pomegranate with free shipping. So, I bought from Jarrow Formulas. I don't think it is even Pomegranate. Whatever it is, it is really nasty tasting. I had to throw it away. I do 95% of my shopping through Amazon; clothes, shoes, HD television, computers, musical equipment, sports goods, books, etc. I have been buying through Amazon for almost 10 years, and this is the first time I have been disappointed. This time, I am not only disappointed, but feel that i might have even been ripped-off. If other subscribers have tried this product and liked it, I'll back off from the "ripped-off" part of my statement. But disappointed - I'll stick with that part of the statement.
