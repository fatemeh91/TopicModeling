review/text: Looking at the ingredients list, it looks nutritious and has a decent nutritional profile; however, I can't stomach it. I tried to drink a whole packet, but could only stomach half of it, before I felt too nauseated to finish it. Dumped the rest.Both this stuff and Myoplex I can't drink. They both taste like melted plastic.I'm sticking to Optimum Nutrition stuff. That stuff tastes lovely. Like strawberry shake. No plastic-y tastes coming from it, and has a similar nutritional profile.
