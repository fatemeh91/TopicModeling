review/text: This stuff goes down smoothly and breaks up nicely with just a few shakes in my blender bottle. It tastes great as well even with just water. I'll blend this with some frozen blueberries and blackberries and fat free milk and it goes down easy. Even the kids enjoy the taste so I'll make them a small batch every once in a blue moon.
