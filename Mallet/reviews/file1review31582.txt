review/text: What a great cane! This cane is strong...and so pretty. I bought it for my own satisfaction...but get many compliments on it from others on how nice it looks. It is very sturdy...I trust the Drive Medical company...also have family that has used them for a wheelchair and a rolling walker...so I thought this would be a good item as well. I have been proven correct...and I am very happy!
