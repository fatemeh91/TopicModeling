review/text: I have been battling with TV for many years but had no idea what it was until recently. I've been using Clotrimazole for several weeks with little progress. Just got thePediFix FungaSoap Cleansing Wash Value Size,13.5 Ouncesa few days ago and I love it. Like many others have stated, it does have a fairly strong smell but I love the Tea Tree Oil fragrance so it is no problem for me.After each use I feel a little tingle where the TV is located. (If you've ever used the Pureology hair conditioner with mint... kind of reminds me of that.) I follow up with the Clotrimazole and after only a few days I already see it fading. I highly, highly recommend this soap. I'll probably continue to use it even after my TV is gone - just because I love the smell and how fresh I feel afterwards!ETA: November 28th changed from 5 to 3 stars. May have just been a coincidence that I saw improvement but nothing changed. Still battling the TV and will be making an appointment with a dermatologist soon. I love the soap's smell but it is a little too expensive for me to use just for the smell and tingle.
