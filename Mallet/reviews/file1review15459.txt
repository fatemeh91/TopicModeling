review/text: Got this in the mail and the tag attached to this changer pad is DISTURBING.Do not want anything near my newborn with a tag that reads: that there may exist trace amounts of chemicals in this product known to cause cancer and birth defect or other reproductive harm. Was shocked Target / Million Dollar Baby would even sell a product like this. Who would use this on their child with a tag that has this warning? I would like to meet that parent....
