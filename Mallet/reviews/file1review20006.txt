review/text: I had this very same tub 5 years ago for my daughter. It worked out great, to answer the age old question about newborns slipping and sliding, well this tub doesnt come with a sling or sponge to place the newborn in for the 1st couple of weeks or so until you or baby can get that pefect grip. It only cost like $4.00 or so to buy a sponge or sling to add to it. Personally I never did have one of those for my daughter and the tub worked just fine. I recently got this tub again for a shower gift for my 2nd child, and I am so happy for it, because I know the tubs potential, it will grow with your child. It fits in the kitchen sink perfectly, it doesn't leak if you don't overfill the tub. I used the tub until my 5 yr old was 9 months old or so when she was ready for the tub tub, I plan on doing the same for my new baby.
