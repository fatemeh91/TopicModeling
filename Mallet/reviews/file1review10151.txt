review/text: The other reviewers don't like the taste - I like it just fine. The issue is that that it has that sickly-sweet flavor that diet drinks have instead of real sugars (although it uses sucralose instead of aspartame). But if you like diet drinks (like I do), then with this shake you get 46g of protein with only 3g of carbs (and 0.5 g of fat), which is the best ratio of protein to carbs and fats that I have been able to find.
