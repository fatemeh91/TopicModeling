review/text: I couldn't get along without this product. As soon as the hot weather comes I have a hard time controlling the itch in my feet (fungal problems). This product works wonderfully - I use it as the last thing I do in the shower and the effects last most of the day. I hardly have to resort to anti fungal creams at all. It's just terrific.
