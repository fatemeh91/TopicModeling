review/text: My feet and hands crack easily on the heels and finger tips. This is the only item I have ever found that actually heals those cracked areas. I have worked as a retail pharmacist for over 30 years, and have recommended this product to many people. This is a great value for a product with 20% urea. Urea is the ingredient that allows the moisture to penetrate the skin. The thicker the callus, the higher the concentration of urea needed.
