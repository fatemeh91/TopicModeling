review/text: I wrote a mostly decent review for this product about 4 days ago, but for the sake of people who might be reading it, I MUST edit it. For some reason, though, I can't edit the stars.This stuff is WICKED. Unless you have a wart that is equally wicked (meaning, huge and stubborn) DON'T USE THIS PRODUCT. It's 40% salicylic acid in a waxy base. This makes for a very dangerous combination, as the acid is more than capable of burning off perfectly good skin and the wax holds it in place as it does it. My desperation to have the tiny warts on my hands gone superceded my biochemical knowledge, and I put on a little bit more than the directed "thin layer." Now, I am nursing first degree burns wherever I put on the product.If you have a monster of a wart, this stuff will rip right through it. It will do the same to your skin, though, so be very, very careful. I went to my doctor, and he prescribed Aldara cream. It's much easier on my skin.
