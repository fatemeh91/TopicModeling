review/text: I highly, highly recommend this product! It removed my wart in two weeks (with less-than-consistent usage). I recommend using the isolation method described in another review as a precaution, but I didn't notice any damage to the skin around my former wart. Also, remember to alternate treatment with airing out (if nothing else, letting the wart dry shows you how the treatment is working).
