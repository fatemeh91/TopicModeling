review/text: These are the best condoms I have yet to use. not only are they ribbed and durable enough to withstand alot of punishment (have yet to break them, which is more than i can say for some other brands), but they are not so thick as to cut out alot of the sensation. They are also flavored, which is a good thing if your significant other has a problem with the taste of latex. while they only come in a strawberry/fruity flavor, it is still better than latex. Makes all sorts of oral foreplay fun and exciting.
