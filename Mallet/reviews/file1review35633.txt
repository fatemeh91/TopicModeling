review/text: The lighter your skin(like me)the longer could take. I have been using this product for months because by experience I know that Hydroquinone works. It comes in a 4% prescription strenght which it works much faster but usually doctors are reluctant to prescribe it. I discover Nadinola by chance with a 3% concentration so I bought it to compare which is better. Both cost around the same....The reason I gave this product 3 stars is because the results are slow and I also understand that for 5 to 7 dollars that's ok....
