review/text: After looking at several drug stores,I was happy to find this product on Amazon because I had used it extensively at friends to relax my neck muscles following a whip-lashing rear-ender auto accident. It fits nicely around the neck and also drops down a bit onto the upper back. It is easy to warm up in the microwave and it is warm enough to relax muscles but not so hot as to burn. I have not used it cold, but I am sure it works equally well on neck and upper back.
