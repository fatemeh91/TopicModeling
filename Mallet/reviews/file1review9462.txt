review/text: I purchased this on August 6, 2010 (according to the yellow bar at the top of this page, courtesy of Amazon) and am coming back today to purchase the product again. Yes, the one tub lasted me just over a year. The high upfront price is offset by the fact that it will last you a very long time. The cream itself is great. I started DE wet shaving a year ago and tried out a few different products in different price ranges. This is easily my favorite. It lathers quickly and you get a very creamy end product with little work. You'll want to use a shave brush/mug combination to get the best possible shave with this cream. It's billed as "unscented" but there is a lavender scent that is not overpowering; just keep in mind that this is not void of all scent. I won't rewrite what other reviewers have said but I plan to use this cream for another year.
