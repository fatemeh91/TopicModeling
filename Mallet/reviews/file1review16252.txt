review/text: I'm not reviewing the condoms themselves, but the "variety pack" altogether.Like other reviewers say, I got a lot of Durex condoms. If you don't like Durex then I don't suggest buying this pack.I also received about 12 condoms that expired within 6 months after I purchased the pack, when the product description guarantees a minimum of 2 years.
