review/text: This picks up as well as my vacuum, is less hassle to empty and clean, and is so quiet I can use it when the kids are asleep even in the hallway right by their doors. I would recommend it to anyone.Tip: When it says you have to hammer the pieces of the handle together strong and solid, it means it about being strong and solid. You have to really pound the handle together when you're assembling it, to get it tightly put together. After that, it works great.
