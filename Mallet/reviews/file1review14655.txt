review/text: taking piracetam, centrophexine, ALPHA-GPC, l-theanine for upcoming promotional test. I just added vinpocetine this morning. As soon as I took it I immediately felt a warm rush/tingling to the back of my head. I know for a fact it is working. I just studied for 1 hour and 45 mins on flashcards and my memory is improving everyday....but today with the vinpoectine, I definitely feel more focused.
