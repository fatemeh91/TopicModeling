review/text: The only razor I use. Wish they were cheaper but what can you say. That seems to be the trend. These things should cost pennies when really they cost several dollars a piece. These do stay sharp for a long time and that is part of the reason I still use them. I see no reason to switch at this point. Hoping the price comes down a bit.
