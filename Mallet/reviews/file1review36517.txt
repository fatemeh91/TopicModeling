review/text: This deodorant is really lovely and very feminine . It reminds me of rose water. It definitely smells like roses and it also smells natural. I am very sensitive to chemical fragrances, so I was happy to find out that this is natural and does not negatively affect me.I would recommend it and you don't have to use much as the scent is strong.
