review/text: I bought this shaver based upon the reputation of Wahl supposedly being good quality. I didn't mind paying over $60.00 for a decent quality shaver. I am terribly disappointed!The construction is of light, cheap plastic. It does not have a solid feel to it. I could have lived with that if it gave a good shave. After charging the shaver for the required time I tried it out. It sounds like a lawnmower. It vibrates almost as much as the 5 hp vibratory plate compactor I use to compact stone with! My hand and face were both numb from the intense vibration after I finished shaving. As I went over parts of the jaw bone I felt my teeth tingling from the vibration.It gave an okay shave. I've had better from a $20 Remington AND without the discomfort the Wahl gives!This is going back.Save your money and get something else.
