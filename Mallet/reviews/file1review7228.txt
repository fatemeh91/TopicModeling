review/text: I purchased this unit about 3 months ago and have been somewhat dissapointed. I am on my feet alot at work and run alot outside of work, so you could say my feet are in need of some pampering! This machine has a very light touch, and i was looking for something with more umphh behind it.The roller balls are pretty useless, and the water jets are lacking in action, however the heating element is excellent. I would prefer a unit with some massaging/vibration action. I will continue to look for something to replace this unit.
