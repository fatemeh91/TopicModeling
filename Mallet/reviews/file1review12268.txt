review/text: I decided to take this for my 2nd pregnancy. The first time around I took the prescription vitamins and I was told that a food based vitamin is better. The prescription vitamins made me a lot sicker than these do. These are pretty easy to swallow and I have not gotten sick from taking them.I do feel more energized with these vitamins than the prescription ones. After reading the back of the label I did notice that it had more folic acid than the prescription vitamin. One thing my midwife says is that I should take a normal vitamin and then take an iron supplement at the end of the day. She says when you take a vitamin with iron it blocks the iron absorption. Since I already bought these I'm going to finish the bottle. When they run out I'll do as she recommended.I think I might take these vitamins even after I'm pregnant because they make me feel better!
