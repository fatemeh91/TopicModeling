review/text: I repeatedly buy this product for my grandparents who can't take solid foods consistently and need something that is filling and energizing. This Whey is the best we've bought out of the many we've tried. It stirs in easy, no clumping; it tastes really good and consistent; and it's not overly sweet. I recommend this if you need a solid meal replacement for old people in your family.
