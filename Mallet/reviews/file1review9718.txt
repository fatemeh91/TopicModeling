review/text: I have smoked for 25 years with quitting numerous times. Quit never lasts. With smoke away I quit 4 months ago and it helped me over the hump.You have to want to quit and educate yourself,start at WWW.WHYQUIT.COM. Nicotine lasts in your body for 72 hours, with patches,gum,and inhalers you are putting nicotine in your body and making your cravings worse. Smoke away is a herbal supplement to help you overcome your cravings,with no nicotine. It is a daily job to tell yourself that today you are not going to smoke.Today I have been smoke free for 121 days and have saved $595.00 by not buying cigarettes.Smoke Away is a great investment!!!
