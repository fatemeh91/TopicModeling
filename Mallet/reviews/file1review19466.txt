review/text: Great so far...my 2yr old (well 2 and 3months) has been using his step stool to get on the toilet as well as just holding the door handle and hiking himself up and over. This seat is great for boys as when they are this little standing up to pee can be a mess, because usually the urine does not even reach within the toilet bowl. The little cup in front allows them to see and watch and still ensure all his 'business' is making it into the toilet! The only reason I didn't give it 5stars is because the little latch that tightens so that it clasps to the seat doesn't seem to fit our toilet seat...so it's very easily moved or removed at this point. But, it hasn't hindered his safety or interest...it's just frustrating knowing it's not secure. Otherwise we just bought it with thoughts of potty training in a few months when our son is a bit older, but he's already excited and using it while at home. I prefer the attachable seat vs the mini toilet chairs because this gets them familiar and trained using the real toilet. Quality is great, and have always been satisfied with BabyBjorn products.
