review/text: I received and started using this product (5 in 1 Pest Repeller PC51 - Ultimate Pestcontro Unit Which Includes 5 Powerful Features) just over a month ago. I live in the country where rodents and other pests are a common concern and the ad stated "Anywhere rats, mice and other critters are a problem!". So I was hoping this would solve my pest issues and I would not have to resort to poisons. But it seems that it has not. The traps are going strong and I cannot say if the "Ultrasonic Rodent Repellent" part of this thing or the "electromagnetic function" is doing anything at all.As an update. The traps have been empty for a few months now. It is currently winter, Dec 2009, and I still have no sign of an rodents of any kind. It may just work on rodents, but I have no way to be sure or prove it. It has had not effect on spiders or ants to date.
