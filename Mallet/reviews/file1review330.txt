review/text: This is the first Rabbit product I ever owned and I was a little skeptible. However, to my suprise this "Bunny" works like a charm and I must say, I am in love. I have read a lot of complaints about the size is too large, sorry girl, this is just right; I only wish the the vibration was a little bit stronger. With something like this, men watch out, you can slowly become obsolete.
