review/text: There are other types of protein that I have tried over the years, and this is by far my favorite. With various different flavors to choose from, my personal choice is the Vanilla Ice Cream. With the vanilla base and a blender, you can create fantastic protein shakes by adding strawberries, peanut butter, or even chocolate. Drinking protein shakes every day, I prefer the option to change the flavors, without buying additional flavors of protein.This is also an effective protein source that I have had personal success with, and I highly recommend it for anyone wanting to add muscle.
