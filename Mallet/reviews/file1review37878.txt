review/text: I put 3 tablets in the last bottle of the day for my teething 6 month old. It seems to soothe him. Before we tried these he would be fussy about 30 mins after going down for the night. Now he seems to be sleeping more peacefully. They do seem to make him a little drowsy so we tough out the sore gums during the day. I was concerned b/c of the belladonna that they contain, but my pediatrician said it's perfectly safe in the recommended dose, but like all medications to keep safely away from baby to prevent overdoses.
