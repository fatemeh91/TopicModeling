review/text: This stuff is wonderful! I feel like it's perfect for Americans who for the most part have acidic diets. I have not gotten sick at all since I have taken this. I think it's been almost a year now. I notice on the days I miss taking it I feel more anxious, and have less energy, and tend to not be as happy. When your body is happy that makes you happy. I really believe that we are what we eat. I highly recommend this product. I recommend, however, even if this is a food and not really a vitamin, to still start out with a small amount because people can have bad reactions to anything. This is a wonderful supplement! Thanks Green Vibrance!
