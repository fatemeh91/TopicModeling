review/text: This product is really good, right now i'm and the ending of my 7th month and i've used this about 3 to 4 times. I feel you should only wear it when your back hurts, because when I put it on when I'm ok, my back then starts to hurt. Another thing is, my baby hates it! She starts kicking and moving around I guess at times it may feel tight but if I loosen it, it then does nothing for my back! Last thing the color, it's only in white and that sucks at times. But At whole this works and I would buy it again.
