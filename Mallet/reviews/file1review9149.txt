review/text: So far, of all the products I've tried, I have to say that this is the best. Easy to use, quick acting, and relatively long lasting. The price is right, too. The only down side is the strong smell when spraying it on. Boy, the whole house will know it's being used! But, it stops the throbbing it my legs, so I'll always have it near by.
