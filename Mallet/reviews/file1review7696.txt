review/text: In my opinion, this bucket is not the bestseller it should be. That's one of the problems with Amazon's bestseller lists. People shop the top 10 and bypass the real deals that are buried further down.I've used this bucket for over two years. Its primary use is mopping the floors in a two-bedroom apartment. It supports this very well. I fill it from a bathtub tap with no problems. You can probably slide it under the kitchen sink tap, but that might take more effort. I prefer the rectangular shape because this makes it a bit easier to slip the mop n and out.The bucket is easy to carry unless you fill it right to the brim, but I don't do that. After two years, he bucket shows no visible signs of wear, and construction is very solid. The spout indentation makes it easier to pour when the time comes to empty it. And the price right now (about $13) makes it a bargain.I hope this helps.
