review/text: My personal physician recommended this and I bought at goo.gl/QzjGQ ,with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!I was told that inflammation is the cause of all diseases. With Curcumin it helps the body rid inflammation and heal. It is a powerful antioxidant that is also anti-viral and anti-bacterial and it seems to have great potential to fight cancer, especially colorectal cancer.1. It can inhibit unwanted bacterial action in the stomach and intestine.2. It is a significant anti-inflammatory.3. It boosts crucial cellular glutathione levels.4. It is a powerful antioxidant.5. It can help prevent liver damage.6. It can prevent and treat cancer.I caught pneumonia around Christmas which cleared up after a round of antibiotics within a couple of weeks. But for several months, I suffered from severe sinus issues which resulted in the production of copious amounts of phlegm which in turn led to vomiting anytime I ate something, no matter how insignificant - even a donut! There was no allopathic solution and I tried numerous natural anti-inflammatories that I had in my house. Nothing. Finally I tried this. I took one easy to swallow capsule in the morning and one before going to bed. Before I even knew what was happening, no more phlegm, no more coughing, no more hawking up, no more spitting into a bag, no more vomiting, no more embarrassment! We're talking like 2-3 days at most. It happened so fast, I didn't even know what hit me. This, after several months of suffering! My wife then demanded a bottle because of its wide ranging health benefits. I intend to spread the word. I'll never be without at least one bottle of it!
