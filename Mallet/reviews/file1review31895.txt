review/text: I take these during my pregnancies to treat and prevent heartburn. Maybe I don't have a predisposition to heartburn, BUT the fact that my esophageal muscles seem to take longer to get food down during pregnancy makes me think otherwise. When I have started to get heartburn I know I can squelch it out by taking 2 of these with a small glass of water. Works every time. Hope it can help for others too. It is natural and will also aid in digestion so your baby may not have as many or no food allergies. I take these with most meals as well as probiotics to avoid developing food allergies with my children (I breastfeed too).
