review/text: I have peripheral neuropathy, which is a painful nerve condition in my feet. I was looking for something to stimulate circulation and warm my feet.This unit does that. The twin jets are pretty powerful and the heat feature allows me to extend my massage time significantly over units without the heat feature.However, the unit is slow to heat room temp water and at 1200 watts, it consumes a lot of electricity to get it to spa temperature. I recommend adding lukewarm water to start and use the heating element to keep the water as hot as you like.The "massagers" are just rollers on the base of the unit, that do very little, especially with people with large feet like me (size 13). You have to roll your feet over the rollers and there is hardly any room for me to do that.And Brookstone does NOT include a battery for the remote. Of course it is a button-type so you have to make a trip to Radio Shack to buy it, instead of raiding your home battery supply drawer.I use the unit in my whirlpool tub (I used to do a whole body whirlpool, but sometimes just wanted my feet massaged). I run the water till lukewarm, put the unit in the tub and fill it. Then I sit on the side with my feet in the unit. It makes it easy to drain as well, being in the whirlpool.Overall, it is a keeper for me.
