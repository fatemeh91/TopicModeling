review/text: August 4 2002 my father, a healthy 54 year old, had a sudden cardiac arrest without any warning or symptoms. It took an ambulance too long to reach him, and despite my mother performing CPR on him he was defibrillated too late and was dead before reaching the hospital.If something like this was available back then, I would have made sure my parents had it with them. As hard as it is to believe, I had premonitions and nightmares about something like this happening to my dad. Just a year before his death I tried to purchase one from Galls catalog, but they refused to fill the order until I had a physician's prescription, which I couldn't get because my dad was not in a "high risk category"Now that this is available over-the-counter, I think it would be great to have around. I will be purchasing one as soon as my next tax refund comes in :)While I am a licensed EMT and know how to work a regular defibrillator, an AED has the advantage in that absolutely anyone, without training, can easily use it.Hoping you never need one...Katie
