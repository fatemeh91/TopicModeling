review/text: I discovered these beautiful little gems at the Sci-Fi Dine-In Theater restaurant at Walt Disney World in Florida. In a darkened atmosphere like the Sci-Fi Restaurant, these cubes show up great.I would recommend them for holidays or theme parties as favors for your guests. Use lots of candlelight during your party rather than overhead lighting to provide a &quot;darkened environment.&quot; Litecubes are economical and will certainly provide entertainment for your guests.This would be a five-star product if the batteries would provide more than 10-12 hours of use. Figure on using them for 3-5 cocktail parties before replacing them. Batteries are not replaceable (unless you have the capacity to reseal the Litecubes). Store your litecubes in the refrigerator to slow the battery's decay.
