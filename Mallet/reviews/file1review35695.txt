review/text: Its says the product only lasts 30 days after opening it and the 2.5 yrs shelf life is only if not opened. It would have been nice to know that beforehand. How could I possibly use this much in 30 days? The product does work okay but the 30 day shelf life is a real deal buster for future purchases. If it was 30 days for a single application that would be different. I have two bottles and will only open the new bottle when I really have to. I will have to find another product that once opened will last years.
