review/text: We now own 2 of these toothbrushes - one for my wife and me, the other for our children. Having just returned from my six month visit to the dental hygienist, I can confirm that this brush is very effective. I can also confirm that our children benefit from the simple smile timer. A very worthwhile purchase.
