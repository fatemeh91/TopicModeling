review/text: I have acid reflux and cannot tolerate eating acidic foods. I used to eat a lot of yogurt, but these days, I can't even eat Greek yogurt without it hurting my stomach. This supplement provides all those active organisms to be found in yogurt and then some, without irritating my stomach.One capsule of the supplement contains 13 billion organisms, consisting of L. Rhamnosus, L. Casei, L. Acidophilus, L. Plantarum, L. Bulgaricus, L. Salvarius, Enterococcus Faecium, S. Themophilus, B. Longum, and B. Breve. These organisms are being studied for their possible beneficial effect on diarrhea, lactose intolerance, colon cancer, cholesterol, and blood pressure.It also contains 300 mg of Fructo-Oliogosaccharides (FOS), which functions as a prebiotic. Prebiotics are what the probiotic organisms eat, so it's supposed to stimulate the growth of all those good organisms in the capsule.I don't know about all the extravagent health claims. What I can say from my own experience is that my stomach is calmer since I've been taking this supplement, and except for a few times when I overindulged, I haven't had much trouble with the acid reflux. In fact, since I started this supplement, I've stopped taking Prevacid. I definitely would recomment this supplement as "Worth A Try" to anyone with acid reflux. Just remember to keep it in the refrigerator-once you open it, it has to stay cold.
