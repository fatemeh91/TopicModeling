review/text: I was disappointed with this deodorant. I live in Asia, and deodorant choices here are limited, so an herbal deodorant with pine scent sounded great. But it sure doesn't smell like pine to me. Even Pine-Sol bathroom cleaner has a more natural pine scent. This scent reminds me of some cheap deodorant some of the guys used to use in the locker room in high school. I can't believe how many people gave this product a high rating; I'll be more careful to read all of the negative reviews before I buy something from now on.
