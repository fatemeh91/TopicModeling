review/text: I purchased this product per the advice of my acupuncturist. He said it provides long lasting moist heat to the affected area. Even with following the directions, I found that the heat does not last more than 10-15 minutes. It is also a chore to heat up as you need to heat it up in water in a pan on the stove each time you use it. I much prefer the rice packs that you can stick in the microwave. Will probably use it, but would not purchase again.
