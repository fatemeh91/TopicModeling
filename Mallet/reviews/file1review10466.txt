review/text: I love chocolate, so I thought the flavor of these sounded great. Other reviewers say they tasted great. So I purchased them. Um....GROSS! They are totally disgusting tasting. I want to gag when I eat them. I gave them two stars because they do the job they are intended to do. But I'm sticking with the fruity flavored TUMS. I just couldn't "stomach" these.
