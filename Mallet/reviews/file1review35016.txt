review/text: REVIEW FOR CHOCOLATE PEANUT BUTTER PURE PROTEIN BARS...They thought I was lactose intolerant. Turned out to be calcium caseinate. And Pure Protein Bars are about the ONLY Protein Bars that do NOT have that awful stuff in them...I always get the Chocolate Peanut Butter Pure Protein Bars. They taste great. And they make me feel really good. They are good for after working out. And they are good to have around for blood sugar leveling.The Carb to Protein ratio is even great!Love Them!!
