review/text: Wow! You get a good-sized bottle (4 oz) of this oil for a very small price and it lasts forever. Fantastic for lubing all kinds of clippers - we use it on the dog clippers as well as my professional human clippers - works equally well on both. Save your money and buy this oil rather than the more expensive ones sold for human hair clippers. It's exactly the same product.
