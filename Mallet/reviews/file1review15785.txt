review/text: This is a great pen as many have said, and as others have also said there are flaws.I have not had a single problem with the turning mechanism as some have. My problem is with the color and the cap. I purchased the Satin Black pen and after about 6 months of use I noticed that the color was fading a little; this is especially noticeable around the turning mechanism. It's not a big problem you can't really see it all that well when the tops on.The cap was the biggest problem. I lost it. It's small and can be lost easily. I actually lost it, I think, getting in and out of my car - some how that motion unscrewed the cap.After losing the cap I sidelined the pen for a few weeks; it looked funny without the cap. I was thinking about buying the same pen, but I thought I would see how much Cross charges (around $50). On their site I found a section for replacement parts. The cap was not listed on the website so I called customer care. The caps are $3 a piece and shipping is only $1 (it does take a LONG time but $1 shipping is nice).When I received the replacement caps (I ordered 5 because I knew I would lose more) I began using the pen again. Three weeks later I caught the clip on something and tore it off damaging pen. Now I have a damaged pen with no clip and 4 extra caps.Overall, I am going to buy another pen. I miss the convenience of red ink, black ink, and pencil. It's a great pen. Plus it seems silly to keep 4 caps and no pen.UPDATE:I did end up purchasing another pen and again, it is a great pen. I am happy I bought another one. Having three in one is a great feature. No problems with the replacement.
