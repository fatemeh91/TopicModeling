review/text: I bought the Trial size combination and really did like it. So this time around I purchased the full size bottles.The After Shave Balm even though in a much larger bottle still had the pump dispenser to ease dispensing the balm. That made it much easier to deal with.I love the way it works on my face and head. I shave both Head and face so I Need a lot of this stuff to cover and keep my head from braking out in a rash.It does seem to work quite well. Thanks folksdrayPS I use a Straight Razor I got from VSR it is hard to beat a Dovo but the Buckinghams seem to do very well also.
