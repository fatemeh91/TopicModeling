review/text: Having bounced around a few times between this and EASs Whey protein powder products,I give a nod to Gold Standard. Its lower cholesterol content combined with less sugars, tips the scale, at least for me. I do have to pay attention to my cholesterol levels; despite what some would have you believe, dietary cholesterol intake does influence those levels (it's not simply related to saturated fats in many cases). That said, EAS's chocolate flavored whey protein powder has a slightly sweeter chocolate taste, something I actually prefer, but overall, Gold Standard's the product I consume most often.
