review/text: I've tried multiple flavors of the Optimum Nutrition, and all of them have been pretty decent. This one tastes to me like the Hershey's style strawberry syrup. It is still slightly chalky, but it mixes well with other things like in my oatmeal, in a milkshake, etc. It's a pretty nice flavor.
