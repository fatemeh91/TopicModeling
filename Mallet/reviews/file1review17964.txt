review/text: This is the first time I ever used a stethoscope, so be forewarned that this is a review by a tyro. The 'scope is purchased for home-use and it seems fine for that purpose. Noises in the lungs can be heard fairly clearly, including congestion when it happens.The unit comes with one set of spare ear buds, so that is nice in case the originals ever get damaged. There is also a name tag that can be installed on front of the 'scope (at the triangle) - not a necessity for us, but I can see how this could be useful in a busy lab.
