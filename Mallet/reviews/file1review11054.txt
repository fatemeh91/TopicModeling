review/text: This product is excellent. I was orginally introduced to a similar product on TV. I tried it and was absolutely amazed, but thought the price was to expensive. I did some research and found Chlorofresh had the same ingredients at a fraction of the price and it works exactly the same. Now, I am not a stinky person, but if you're like me and have a bit or morning breath this product completely eliminates it in only 2 days!! It really is worth it, so give it a try. You won't be disappointed.
