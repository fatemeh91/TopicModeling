review/text: I was so excited to give this a try. When I got it I excitedly opened it. 2 seconds later when I read the ingredients my excitement disappeared. Parabens are all up in it. I know I should have read the ingredients but I thought since it was a "high" end lube it wouldn't have junk in it. My vagina is super sensitive so this lube won't be coming near it but I opened it so I guess I will use it on my partner. I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because it I do like the texture. Still super disappointed.I recommend:Sliquid Organics Natural Gel 8.5 fl ozIt's long lasting, vegan, organic, and paraben free. This stuff is amazing. I wish I had never tried anything new.
