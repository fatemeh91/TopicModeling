review/text: If anyone has ever drank coffee in the morning or drink caffeine products regularly, then you'll find this product just fine. Those that say it makes them crazy or wanna die? That's just ridiculous. I have taken all suggested serving amounts and have had no side effects. It gives the energy boost I need with no jitters at all. I think it's just crazy the kind of reviews out there..If anything, this is one of the weaker diet pills out there. If you want a diet pill to try at a cheap price, this is a no brainer. I have had no feeling of not wanting to eat, still get hungry, but just a great energy boost. Nothing else to say about it, just a mediocre diet pill at best I guess...
