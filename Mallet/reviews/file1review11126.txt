review/text: I was introduced to Emergen-C in 2001 and have used it since. It's a great burst of Vitamin C. Just open the packet and add to water. It fizzes up and then you drink it. When I have a cold (or even when I feel one coming on) I use it and feel a burst of pep shortly thereafter. I take it along when I travel too. I find it more economical to get at Wal-mart or Trader Joe's but if you don't have one nearby it's still a decent price online.
