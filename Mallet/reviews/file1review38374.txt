review/text: It has been a couple decades since I have used an epilator. Wow, how they have changed! I am wishing I had tried this one years ago. I love it. I have thick coarse hair on my legs and it grows very fast; shaving doesn't last long enough and I do not like the stubble. Waxing is painful and expensive. This device did't hurt. It is more of a quick tugging kind of sensation, much like what you would have with tweezing only it does more hairs at one time. The results on my legs and underarms was very smooth skin. I recommend exfoliating before and a couple days after to help prevent ingrown hairs.
