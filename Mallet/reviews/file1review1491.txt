review/text: After reading all the great reviews I was thinking that this stuff was really strong and going to work. I was expecting to feel a light burning sensation so I could tell that it was working. I tried using this several times and it did nothing. I don't know if I just got a bad one because it looked like it was somewhat melted when I opened it. Too me, I felt like I was putting chapstick on a wart and hoping it would work.
