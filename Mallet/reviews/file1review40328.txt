review/text: Here's why I really like this: whenever I take products like Airborne and Zicam, I worry about going overboard with the vitamins because I also take a daily multivitamin. So I'm left wondering if it's really okay to take all the extra vitamins, or if it'll upset my stomach or even cause toxicity. (And sometimes I do get an upset stomach from Airborne.)This, on the other hand, doesn't contain vitamins. Its main ingredient is echinacea, which is one of the few herbs that has actual scientific evidence backing its usefulness. It has proven itself in clinical trials as being effective against the common cold. (So has zinc.)So I can take this and still take my multivitamin and not worry.Now the downside: Directions say to take two of these five times per day for two days at the onset of symptoms. Of course it's tough to remember to do anything five times per day, but aside from that, it means you'll use up the bottle in two days-- so you'll need a fresh bottle every time you start to feel a cold coming on.If this bottle could guarantee me that it would stop (or lessen) every cold I'd get, I'd gladly pay the price for it. But it is hard to spend that kind of money and then get sick anyway.I've used up my bottle because I started to feel a sore throat after a very stressful and sleep-deprived week. On the second day, after about 6 or doses, the sore throat did subside and hasn't turned into a cold yet (as it normally does for me). So based on this very limited experience, I'd say it's effective and I'd give it another try.
