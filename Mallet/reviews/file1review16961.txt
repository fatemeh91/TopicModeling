review/text: I started growing my present beard 3-4 weeks ago. My only complaint is that the directions are sorely lacking in how to use this trimmer. There is no picture with the adjustable length attachment in place & not nearly enough words to save stress in figuring out which way to use it without cutting your beard very short or at the desired length. I finally figured it out this morning & with fear tried it & I had figured right. It worked great, but had I not thought it through for the past couple of weeks, it could have been a beard disaster. I think I will enjoy using the trimmer now that I figured it out and tested it. I have had beards previously in my life with no electric trimmer but this time will be a more pleasant experience at controlling the length & style. So the only reason I did not give the trimmer 5 stars is because of the crummy directions.
