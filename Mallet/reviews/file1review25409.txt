review/text: I don't know why this is getting so many bad reviews. I've had this for about 5 years and it works well. It takes some getting used to, but it works. You need a little experience and need to play around with it a little, but you'll get the hang of it. The battery will work for at least 50 trims (has for me). For those who dropped and broke it, I think that's less the fault of the device than the person. Most of all, it's cheap! I used to use nail scissors to cut my hairs, but now I just use this. It's quick and easy. I even use this to trim ear hair and eyebrows now.
