review/text: My 3rd Gopher just broke. ALL 3 have broken after a short time with light use in the exact same way; The suction cups fall off of the screws because the plastic inserts crack.I am a foster/adoptive mom. My hands are full, as well as my minivan! I needed a grabber so when I have all the kids in the van, I can pick up dropped items, hand things to the kids in the back row with ease, etc.I purchased the Gopher because it was easily accessible at Wal-Mart. In hindsight, it seems that all I may have done is waste more than $30 of our hard-earned money.I contacted the manufacturer, Ontel, right after the last one broke. This was their response, "We will send you a 1-time complimentary set of the SUCTION CUPS W/SCREWS and directions on how to reattach, we will also include an order form so that you can order more whenever needed. You will receive in 3 business days."I still need a grabber, so in a few weeks when the latest set of suction cups break (and they will) I will invest in one from a totally different manufacturer. I will buy one that has the highest customer reviews and that will last me a good long time!This is how I would sum up my review:Fool me once... Well, I'll gave it 1 extra chance because the 1st one may have been defective.Fool me twice, shame on Ontel.Fool me three times... OKAY, THAT'S IT... shame on me.
