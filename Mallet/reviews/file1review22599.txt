review/text: I started using this product after much researching ...... that I should be on a bile supplement since I have had my gallbladder removed (35 years ago). I have had off and on digestive difficulties, some constipation, but nothing horrible.Since I am a believer in complimentary medicine, the rational seemed right. I have been on this about 2 months, using one with most meals. What I have noticed is that I have lost about 12 lbs without changing anything. I eat very healthy and exercise most days but have not been able to loose weight (I am about 20 lbs over). I have tried everything too, FOR YEARS !!!!!...I eventually blamed menopause and that was that.Now, I believe that I am digesting better, getting more nutrition from my food and that is is causing the weight loss. I feel great and am finally fitting into my size 8 jeans again. I will never be without this supplement.
