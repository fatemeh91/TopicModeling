review/text: BLACK 7 DECKER HV9010P pet series cyclonic-action corded dustbuster & blower, is the pet hair retriever I have ever had. I have two long haired cats, that shed 365 days of the year. I've slways had pets,cats & dogs(most with long hair) I've tryed just about everything! This is the best. The best way I found is to put a strap on it, so you can put it on your shoulder when using the hose. (I used a shoulder strap from a piece of luggage, works great! Its stronger then my hoover,& does a much better job, & its a great price.
