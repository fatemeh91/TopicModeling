review/text: I will say that it is easy to use and comes in a nice travel case. But when I went to the doctor's office to compair numbers against their monitor, it read much higher then it should. I liked the monitor, I just wish that the numbers would be closer to the right number. I'm not happy with it and it has just been sitting in the case.
