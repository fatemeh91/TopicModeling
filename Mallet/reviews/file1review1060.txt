review/text: I say that I'm biased because I am selling one on Amazon at the time I'm writing this, and wanted to offer full disclosure (too bad our politicians don't do that!). I bought one of these for my wife about 6 years ago, she loved it and still uses it to this day. Being a typical husband, I was shopping for a thoughtful gift a couple of years ago and bought her this unit, not realizing it was the same one she already had (oops). She is happy with the one she has since it was pink (the new one was white). It works well in the shower and she likes the massage it gives when exfoliating. The first one is still working great so we have no complaints about the quality or durability of the unit.
