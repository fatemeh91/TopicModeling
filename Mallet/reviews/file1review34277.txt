review/text: I originally gave this product only 2 stars, citing a mild burning (yet cold) sensation that I found slightly uncomfortable rather than relieving. I surmised the reason might be because I am sensitive to products like BenGay, Tiger Balm, and mentholated creams (they don't help my muscle spasms, they just feel like a sunburn to me). So I figured I was having a similar reaction to this product. And I wrote my review after that one-time external use of the ointment. Well, I noted something about 3 hours later - my pain had reduced significantly. I have a small fissure that is causing a chronic anal spasm (very painful, can't walk or sit). Just applying this ointment externally relieved some of the internal spasm and pain within hours.I now believe my initial discomfort was simply due to the intensity of the effect on my fissure - it was helping it heal. Suddenly I could at least put my legs down when I was lying prone. For the past couple months I could only lay on my back was with my knees up (it gets tedious a the first couple weeks).So I decided to take a chance a use the insertion tube to apply some more ointment internally - again very intense the first time, but again after about 3 hours I could walk for the first time in while without feeling like I had sandpaper in my bum.Within the next 24 hours my ability to at least stand and walk comfortably increased by about 50%.I am now on day 3 using the ointment twice daily as directed and I feel 80% reduction in my pain overall. Can't sit yet, but I find myself relatively comfortable for the first time in months. Amazing. Didn't think I'd feel this much better for another month or more. I am hopeful about what the next 3 days will bring.Regarding some of the reviews that showed concern over infection, I have to say that I'm also wary, but with results like this I can't say I am feeling much regret. Guess we'll see what the future holds, but for now I am calling this a 5 star product.
