review/text: Better than a simple washcloth for lathering up and for exfoliating dead skin. Just the right texture for scrubbing in moisturizing cleanser in the oily parts of your nose, yet soft enough to use with soft bathing soap all over. Since the mesh is plastic, no bacteria have a chance to grow - it's easy to clean, just run it under hot water and hang it to dry.
