review/text: Before I bought this carpet sweeper, I carefully read all the Amazon reviews. So when my sweeper came, I carefully followed the directions enclosed and took to heart the advice posted by those who said they had no problems with the handle. Well I'm here to tell you -- I pounded that handle within an inch of its life -- but it still pulled apart. Nonetheless, it works well on carpets, bare floors and is spectacular on throw rugs and it looks quite sporty with the red electric tape holding the pieces of the handle together. My theory is that perhaps the quality control/inspection of handle pieces might not be all that it could be. And the price was certainly right.
