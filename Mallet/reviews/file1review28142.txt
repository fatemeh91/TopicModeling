review/text: I have no reason to give this product anything less than 5 stars. It is a high quality protein, tastes great, is offered at a GREAT price and was delivered quickly. I used the shipping subscription service and I think ended up paying $36. That's pretty darn good for 5 lbs of high quality protein powder. I have no idea what other reviews are talking about when they state that it does not taste very good. I think it tastes great. I always want more when I'm done with the shake. I mix it with skim milk. Even if it tasted mediocre I would give it 5 stars. It's PROTEIN people! It's not supposed to be some gourmet treat you would find on a cruise ship. However, with that being said, it sure doesn't taste like protein.I have ordered Syntha 6 before this and I do enjoy that product more due to the combination of different protein types, as well as the fact that it tastes like ice cream. I actually did gain strength on that (with nothing else changing). However, it's a bit more expensive and you only get around 52 servings (with Gold Standard you get 73). Seeing as I use 2-3 scoops a day you can burn through it pretty quickly. If I wasn't an average person with average means (and 2 children in day care) I'd probably stick with the Syntha 6. However, this is reality....and what you get with this Gold Standard is darn good.This is a fantastic product and I am going to stick with it for a long time as I cannot find a better value anywhere.
