review/text: After my first ADC pediatric stethoscope was recently lost or stolen I needed a new scope fast. I loved the last one so decided to replace it with another ADC. Not before I peeked at the Littmanns though... $73-125?? Believe me, they are no better acoustically! Paying extra (2-4 times as much)just because they advertise on "ER"? The only thing the other brand has going for it is a better color selection (but only on the peds model) and slighly more comfortable ear tips, although the Adsoft rubber tips aren't bad and I appreciate that it comes with extras. It arrived faster than I expected, too. All I ask is that if you need a good stethoscope buy your own ADC and leave mine alone!
