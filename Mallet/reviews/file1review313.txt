review/text: My boyfriend bought this for me for Christmas, i have to say at first (without using it) i was a little disappointed with the rotation i thought it would be stronger after using it though i thought this thing was absolutely amazing. my boyfriend seems to be a little jealous off it but i guess you'll have that lol. Ive used it in the shower now twice and i have had no problems at all. like other people have stated it does have a new rubber smell to it but its very faint to begin with and will fade off you really cant smell it unless its right up by your face. as far as width though... wet or lubricated Ive had a hard time getting it in. there's been times where i just gave up and didn't even bother because it hurt but once its in its actually very pleasurable. deff. not a toy for people who are inexperienced that's for sure. all in all great product and especially for the price I'm very pleased. : )!!! ill probably buy more here very soon lol
