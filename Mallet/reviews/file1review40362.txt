review/text: I was starting to get a runny nose and started taking this as directed. It did not seem to make a difference, and I was sick for about a week. I do not normally take anything other than a multivitamin, so I don't know if that makes a difference. Everyone reacts differently, and I don't know if I had a virus (I want to be fair to the product). It is fairly costly, as this is a one treatment box! Also, there seem to be too many contraindications for my liking, and they recommend consulting your physician before taking. I wouldn't use this again, nor can I recommend it.
