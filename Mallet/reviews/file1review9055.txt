review/text: I was never the vitamin taking type. When I decided to do the research on vitamins, I was overhwelmed. Luckily, I came across the reviews for Green Vibrance. I've been taking it for almost a year now and the results are like night and day. My family was the first to notice my that I was more energetic, then my hair and skin looked better. I'm 54 years old, but,I swear I feel 15 - 20 years younger! This product works and I've recommended it to everyone I love! Tastes best with apple juice or another sweet juice... TRY IT :P
