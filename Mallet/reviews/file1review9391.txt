review/text: Each of the 7 portable plastic containers is labeled with a day of the week and divided into two compartments, AM and PM. I find them to be easy to open, though some will have difficulty, and they've never opened accidentally. You can keep them in the tray, or throw them in a bag or even a pocket whenever you need to. There's easily enough room for, say, 5 large pills twice a day. Overall, I'd say that this is a good deal for anyone who needs to keep track of more than two pills at a time, or who is taking a medicine that requires a complicated schedule.
