review/text: I grew up in China and using herbs was a standard. I have used all the ingredients listed here echinacea, black elderberry and ginger when I was young.Recently I came back from a winter trip where I shook hands with quite a few people who apparrently were inflicted by colds. Then I found out half of my office mates were sick with colds too. My throat started to hair up. So I took this for a few days with some additional vitamin C or simply just more fruits and vegetables. I was fine through out this period.At another instance, hubby complained about a sore throat and tiredness. I felt it too. So we both took this with what you call healthier foods with a little less meat, fat, sugar... but more fiber, greens, and hot SOUPS. It turned out well for both of us.The only thing I miss - in the traditional chinese way, herbs, especially preventive herbs to increase your immune defense, were taken in the form of herbal tea. It became a life style and a holistic way of care for the body. Taking pills is easy but really nothing to be savored.
