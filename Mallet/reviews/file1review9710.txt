review/text: Well, I tried this stuff due to all the good reviews which I now realize are fake! cuz if you search the web for reviews on this product you find those exact same reviews , with the exact same wording!! but sometimes the names are different. so I'm pretty sure the company who makes this product cut and pasted them into Amazon!anyway the kit came intact, haven't watched the CD yet; the Formula 1 pills make me sick even just to smell them! even though I take them with food I feel pretty nauseous an hour later! and the homeopathic pellets are nothing but sugar !! nothing seems to curb my appetite for cigarettes so I guess it has to be all down to will power!!!I'm gonna try to get my money back or at least part of it anyway! since I can't even stomach the pills!!!I'm still on the lookout for some herbal smoking cessation pills that makes cigarettes taste awful. I knew of something like this years ago, but forget the name of the company or if they even exist anymore.anyway to all the rest of you out there: this is a REAL review and I say this product sux!!! don't waste your money, I guess maybe Chantix is the way to go!
