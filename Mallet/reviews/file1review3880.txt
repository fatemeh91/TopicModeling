review/text: I apply these once a year to keep my teeth whiter, and just brush often the rest of the year. The premium 7-day pack is more convenient than the two week, and premium plus is pretty rough on the gums. Things to take into consideration is the mild discomfort associated with tooth whitening, it can make your gums ache and your teeth sensitive. Some people with already sensitive teeth should probably find another method for whitening, still though, they are a heck of a lot cheaper than having the dentist do it. Also, the dentist usually does such a good job whitening teeth that they look like you brush with radioactive toothpaste or something..I've always stuck to the principle that your teeth shouldn't be any whiter than the whites of your eyes, that way they look nice and white, without that freaky whiteness. In that regard this product will get you where you want to be. Plus, if you brush regularly with a whitening toothpaste, you can maintain your results for a year.
