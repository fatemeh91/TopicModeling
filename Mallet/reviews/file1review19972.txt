review/text: I received The First Years underarm thermometer as a baby shower gift in 1998. I also received a Braun ear thermometer at the same shower. The Braun seemed easier and much faster to use so initally that is what I was using. After using it several times I realized that it didn't seem to be very acurate. I ran across the The First Years underarm thermometer in a box of items I had put away after the shower. I decided to give it a try. I was so pleased with it that I told every new mom I knew how great it was. It is easy to read and gives you an acurate temperature in a very short amount of time. If you are using it on an infant it is very simple to hold the childs arm next to his side until the thermometer beeps. The same is true when your child is old enough to understand simple instructions on how to hold their arm for a few minutes. It is a little more difficult at that in between age when they don't always understand that they have to sit still of a few minutes. Overall, I would say this is a must for all moms, new and experienced alike. ALSO, AN EXCELLENT BABY SHOWER GIFT!!!!
