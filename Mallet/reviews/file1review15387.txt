review/text: The description of this product states that there is no added starch and yet the first ingredient is cornstarch. My boyfriend took this when I ordered it for him after checking the ingredients on amazon but without reading the fine print on the bottle. He is on a starch free diet because starch makes him flare up. Well now it has been about three days and he is still in severe pain. I am extremely unhappy with this and I have learned an important lesson; you can't trust that the product you receive will match the description online.
