review/text: These bars look decent in theory. Only 1g of sugar, high protein, moderate carbs. You'd think they would be great for your blood sugar, but they're not. These bars spike your blood sugar as much as a moderate GI carbohydrate would. I suspect it's the massive amount of sugar alcohols in the bars. I don't think I've ever seen a protein bar with as much sugar alcohol in it as these bars have. I would only use these bars in a pinch if you need some protein to satisfy your hunger, and/or fill your protein needs. As far as this being a low GI treat, forget it. While it looks that way in theory, it doesn't play out like that in the body.Lastly, eating these makes my teeth hurt, as if I just consumed straight sugar packets. I'm not even joking, I can eat a Snickers bar and my teeth won't hurt, but these bars make my teeth absolutely ache.In closing, there's really not much benefit you're going to receive from these bars, other than satisfying hunger temporarily. They have no nutritive value. Yes, they added some vitamins and minerals to the bar, which are in a highly unusable form (the kind you'd find in a cheap Centrum vitamin, which your body can't even utilize). This bar has no fiber, is loaded with sugar alcohols, is horrible for your dental health, and has denatured, overly processed protein, which I'm sure can't be digested and utilized because of how overly processed it is. This is an "old school" protein bar, meaning, it's been outdated for 30 years. Protein bars of the 2010's have fiber, superfooods, omega-3's, isolated proteins, and whole food vitamins and minerals.Met-Rx needs to get with the program here. This is 2012 (almost 2013). The bar Joe Weider created in the 1950's doesn't cut it anymore, with what we know about health and nutrition.
