review/text: I've had this gizmo for many years. It's far superior to the mechanical unit that I had before that didn't cut at all. This gizmo has worked fine and has never failed. However, it just won't cut the hair. I have to buzz and buzz and buzz to get the job done, which really only should take about 5 seconds per nostril.
