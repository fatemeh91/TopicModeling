review/text: These tablets are amazing. Within 5 minutes of giving 2 tablets to my daughter, her whole attitude changes back to the sweet little girl she can be. With my son, I would give him Tylenol. I felt terrible for his pain and felt like giving Tylenol almolst every night wasn't a good thing. I found these and am so glad that I did. My dauther loves the taste and there's no waiting for the Tylenol to kick in. I mentioned to her Pediatrician that we were using these and she had nothing bad to say about them. My husband and family were amazed at the effects of the tablets so I checked to see if the ingredients were safe, just to make sure. Everything in them is natural and safe for baby. Wish I had used these for my son. I highly recommend these and have already told my pregnant friends about them.
