review/text: Typically I'm skeptical of "premium" brand names, but I've used mach 3, a few generic razors, and earlier Gillette models, and I have to admit the Gillette Fusion cartridges are the best. Using these blades while sharp I almost never nick myself. My facial hair is a little tough so I used to have trouble getting a clean shave on the first try. With these razors that's never been an issue for me.Granted, these are the most expensive razors you'll typically see in stores. However, the amazon price is great (especially with subscribe & save). Moreover, using tips I saw on another razor review, I can get an individual Gillette razor to last about a month. By rinsing the gunk off with hot water after shaving, spraying the razor with shower cleaner, then propping it against the wall the durability improves dramatically.Honestly, if I hadn't discovered I could make a single razor last a month I wouldn't bother buying these. I think they're the best, but they're not THAT much better than other razors. A dull razor is a dull razor regardless of brand. Yet, if you can make a razor 12 pack last a year, and they're so cheap on Amazon, why not buy the best?
