review/text: I just got this thing yesterday and used it today. Because of a review I read here I also got a foam insert. I ended up putting the insert halfway into the tub and leaning my son's head against the molded headrest and his behind against the insert and WOW!IT WAS SO EASY!!!!In the infant tub he was always listing sideways (he's 3.5 months old right now, technically too young for the snug-tub and he can't sit up by himself yet though he's great with support) and thanks to the contoured headrest in the snug-tub he did GREAT. He also had more water around him so he wasn't cold while I washed him like he was in his infant tub.He sat there and would not stop smiling at me! And my back didn't hurt from holding him constantly with both arms AND washing him at the same time, though I had to lean over the bathtub!I've decided to recommend this thing to EVERYONE I know who is having a baby!
