review/text: I first tried these Ricochet Mints at work. The person in the cubicle next to me suggested I try them and I'm really glad I did. That fact that these mints are sugar free, have all natural ingredients in them, and that they taste great makes them a joy to eat every time I use them. The flavor is not so strong that you will hate it. I originally ordered these because Amazon.com was out of the licorice flavor which is my favorite. I'd highly recommend them to anyone who wants a decent breath mint and who likes the taste of fruit punch. They are definitely tasty.
