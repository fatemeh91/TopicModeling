review/text: This thing smells SO gross, like harsh, toxic chemicals, that I can't even use it! I've washed it in HOT, super soapy water, cleaned it with alcohol, and even let it "air out," all to no avail. I tried using it and the smell was seriously distracting. I took it out of my drawer, after all the washing, to show it to my boyfriend and while i was still a good four feet away he said, "Ewww, what's that smell." I found it to be WAY too large, too, and I've had kids. Sadly, this will be going in the garbage.
