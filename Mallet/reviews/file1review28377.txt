review/text: I've used this same product for about a year now and am really happy with the quality. I felt sick at first drinking this because I guess my body wasn't used to it, now it's part of my daily diet. It helps especially when I'm strength training particularly hard. I haven't compared it to many other products but the ones I have also claim to be the best which don't come close to this. I think I really like the fact that I get everything I need in quanity while maintaining quality and ontop of that I get my chocolate fix! mmm chocolate
