review/text: I got these because I have high arches (nothing freakish) and require support for my "everyday" work shoes. I needed a 3/4 length because this pair of shoes don't have much spare room. The 3/4 length works great for that. Also, the carbon strip along the bottom is great for medial support and keeps the structure of the shoes while I'm walking. Also, the heel cushioning is pretty nice.The reason I only gave 3 stars is because these are supposed to be arch supports. I don't imaging you have a huge need for arch supports if you don't have high arches. Although I notice a slight improvement in support of my actual arch over the plain shoes, these definitely do not support my full arch. I'm sure these would help someone with a low-to-normal arch who has too much flex in the middle of their feet when they walk, but if you have low-to-normal arches, why do you need something called an "arch support"? I have other inserts that definitely give better support to my arch.All that said, the heel cushion and rigidity of the midsole make my feet feel better with them than without so I'm keeping them, although I won't order another pair unless they increase the actual support to the arch.
