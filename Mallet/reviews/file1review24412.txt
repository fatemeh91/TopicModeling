review/text: I've used Valerian root for sleep before with some success. It doesn't put me to sleep, but once I fall asleep, I sleep deeply and feel more rested in the morning. Deep Sleep contains Valerian root, California Poppy, Passionflower, Chamomile flower, and other ingredients.Both I and my travel partner took it, and we both had nightmares. It's worth trying, however. As with all herbal preparations, it's best to try different formulations and find what works for you. This didn't work for me, but it may for you.
