review/text: I have a weak immune system, and have been convinced this is an important and affordable supplement. Personally I take double the daily amount with no side effects except that as I had read on Dr. Mercola's website, my skin has gotten a bit more rosy or less sallow. Astaxanthin in their natural food is what causes flamingos to be pink! The tablets have a slightly fishy taste, but they don't leave you with fishy burps the way fish oils or krill oil can. Also, I believe you can get them in a gel capsule which has no taste. Read up on this supplement, especially if you sunburn easily or are concerned about vision (I think I remember reading it is protective or supportive of eye health).
