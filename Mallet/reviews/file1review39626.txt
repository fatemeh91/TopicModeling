review/text: As a dentist of over 20+ years experience, I have seen over and over again the results of not flossing one's teeth. The unfortunate result of such neglect is inevitable gum disease, which over time leads to tooth loss. Gum disease almost always starts in-between the teeth and the only way to clean the germs that cause gum disease from between the teeth is with floss. Mechanical scrubbing with floss is the key, and all the daily brushings and rinsings will not remove the in-between stubborn plaque below the gumline. The bottom line is that we need to floss our teeth if we want to keep them for a lifetime.I have heard all the excuses for not flossing: The floss is too hard to handle, my fingers turn blue, my fingers are too fat, I'm too clumsy, the floss hurts my gums, etc, etc. The Flossaide Dental Floss Holder removes most of these excuses. Of all the floss aides available, this one is the best. It has a long handle to reach way back in one's mouth, the floss is easy to load, the device is strong and will last years, and best of all, it is reusable. No more having to run to the store because the disposable flossers are gone! Load it with your favorite floss and you are set for healthy gums and teeth.I have recommended this floss aid to my patients over the years and I strongly recommend it to you as well. One still has to develop the habit of flossing daily, and this device aides in the mechanics of flossing, making it a breeze. Get it and save your teeth!Jim "Konedog" Koenig
