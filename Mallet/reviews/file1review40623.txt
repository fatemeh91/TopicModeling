review/text: I read several of the other reviews that were displeased because this product did not work well for them in removing food particles, etc; i.e., getting their dishes clean. I understand how this could be a fact. Our household is the type that rinses dishes really well before placing in the dishwasher so we don't have this issue. Compared to other non-toxic liquid dishwashing soaps we've used this is equally as good, if not better. If you're concerned about the environment and willing to give your dishes a good rinse this should work well for you.
