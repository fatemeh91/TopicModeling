review/text: This product was a big disappointment. It was too big and bulky for a the neck; plus, the velcro strap kept getting caught on the fabric of the piece. I ended up burning a hole in it from microwaving it once after it got too cold from a previous microwave heating. The beads spilled out onto the microwave tray. Compared to a 'bed buddy' made from rice pellets and shaped in a sausage type arrangement, a product I bought at Target years ago (it's still working just fine), this product, much more expensive, was a waste.
