review/text: My eye doctor (from Johns Hopkins Hospital} told me to use this since there was the Macualr in my family (my Mom had it) and she told me this would help slow the problem down. It does not make your stomach weird and you take 2 a day with a cup of water. There is really no taste when taking the "pill".the bottle contains 120 pills.
