review/text: Rarely write reviews but I love Amazon and am compelled to share. I used this in my car for a few weeks and it sprang a leak. Ok, I thought, we'll patch it and that'll be it. Nope. Three more times in different areas (seams, etc). I'm an average guy (5'9'' and 155lbs) so not too much force on it. Sick of it. Not even recyclable :(
