review/text: I've had it for three weeks now and am 110% satisfied. I was hoping it would be as close as what I had with a razor but was extremely happy to see that it's much closer and easier. No fooling around with shaving cream. No fooling around with opening the head and manually cleaning it. It couldn't be easier and closer.
