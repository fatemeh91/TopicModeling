review/text: My wife and I have been in search for the best feeling condoms on the market. After some research, I've tried the Trojan Ultra Thin, Trojan Bare Skin, and these Okamoto Crown Super Thin. These are great, but I wasn't thrilled with 2 things (see Pro's and Con's below).Pro:-They are thin. Much better than the Trojan Ultra Thin condoms.-Durable and we have not experienced any breakage.Cons:-Strong rubber smell from these.-The Trojan Bare Skin felt much better than these.-These appeared to dry up faster having us re-lube every so often.
