review/text: I purchased several of these kits. I don't golf, but I do have 5 kids and am always needing bandaids while we are at the park or zoo etc...These are in a great little plastic case that is easy to find and small enough for a purse, diaperbag or glove box!Perfect for the small boo boo's when you are on an outing!
