review/text: I tried this on a recommendation from a blogger and have been very pleased. While I'm not thrilled about shaving every day, this is the one part I look forward to. My skin feels calm and moisturized all day long, which is nice. I don't bother with the pre-shave or shaving cream products (yet), but will stick with this after-shave until I find something better.
