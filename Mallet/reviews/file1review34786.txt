review/text: Do not get this product. It smells like something you would spray on stinky shoes to clean them. Its medicinal and horrible. Your sweaty pits will smell better than this stuff, trust me. It lasts for days - on your shirt, your coat, in your bathroom, everywhere you went after spraying that stuff on.Plus - there are *no returns* on opened health & beauty products! Buyer beware!
