review/text: The batteries are the best ones I have! I own two other sets DURACELL 2650mah, one of them is a very good set, keeps charge for a month; the other loses it for a few days. Had other brands before, much worse! So these batteries last for VERY long time; would say- months without recharging. This new technology is really good; I will not buy the old NIMH anymore. As of my knowledge, all these new stile batteries are made by SANYO, for all other brands, what is good, because Sanyo is the biggest and best battery maker. Very Happy, highly recommended!
