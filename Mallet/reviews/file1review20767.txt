review/text: first off i use this machine to shave my head. i used a cheap electric shaver before and after 3 weeks my head looked like edward james olmos' face! needless to say, i needed a more expensive type. this machine is great. it cleans itself, the fluid is not expensive, and my head up until right now is shiny. it wont get every speck of hair like a disposable. but its much closer than the barber clippers, and if you use some sort of after shave and/or pre-shave(electric) lotion/solution, you wont be disappointed. all in all, spend the darn money and get a good...no, great electric shaver like this one.
