review/text: This product reliably helps me sleep. I have found that it does need to be taken as directed, which involves some forethought. It is relatively expensive, but I've tried nearly everything on the market and this not only makes me sleepy (but not groggy, I could wake up and function in case there was any need to) it does seem to help keep asleep through the night.
