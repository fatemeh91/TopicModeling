review/text: I believe something is stuck in the propellar / disposal blade. Figured this would be easier than taking the diswasher apart and worth a try. Seems to have quieted the grinding noise down and has made the inside of the basin cleaner by smell and sight after two applications. Worth using once a month for regular maintenance especially in areas with poor water.I was told by a repair service that even the most expensive dishwasher model available will not stand up to poor water supplies. I think this product will prolong the life of the unit tho.
