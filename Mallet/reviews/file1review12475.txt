review/text: I had toxicity issues, chronic inflammation, hyperactive immune system and tried this product after lots of other medical approaches. I did only two days. Made a huge difference immediately. You must produce enough stomach acid to make it work; I have to drink water with lemon juice or apple cider vinegar to get the effects. Caused me to get off the acid reduction pills my doctor had prescribed for stomach pain. I realized that producing too little acid and not too much was part of my problem. I also had to change my toxic environment. I highly recommend. I haven't done the 7 day but I do a one day cleanse about once every two weeks for maintenance. All vegetarian. Good buy for the money.
