review/text: This is simply the best jar opener I've used, because it grips easily, and doesn't slip.I'm not sure why they market it so narrowly to those with arthritis. Anyone would prefer it to the other jar openers I've tried.The only drawback is that it does make a dent in the edge of the lid proportional to the force that was necessary to turn the lid. The dent doesn't prevent re-using the lid, but I wouldn't use the Un-Skru on any lid that needed to be preserved "for show" for some reason. (In the latter case, I'd use some kind of strap wrench, e.g.SEEN ON TV Grip Wrench Pro, though that would be much less convenient, and prone to slipping.)
