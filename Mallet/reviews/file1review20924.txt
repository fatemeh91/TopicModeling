review/text: I have the most sensative face and hard to cut/heavy beard of any person I've ever met. For me to shave every day means tons of blood and a face that feels like a gun shot wound. With that said this shavor is great! I have had it for apx. two weeks and have shaved almost everyday with it, no pain or blood. It took several shaves to get my face use to it but now I'm getting a almost perfect shave.I still have a few left hairs and slight roughness on my neck but for my beard I think that's great.I love the way this thing is self cleaning/charging.I drop it in and go!The razor really does seem brand new everytime you use it.I've used the Norelco with the "GOOO" before and had to go back to the blade, lousey shave.I never thought I'd be able to use a dry shavor? read the reviews on here and thought what the heck,glad I did.I can't imagine a face that this thing couldn't shave?? Since my beard is really bad I get the best results from shaving everyday.But I have gone a couple of days and my beard still doesn't look to bad.I also use the Afta pre-shave to help with my thick beard.I know you'll like this razor!!!
