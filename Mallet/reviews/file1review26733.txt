review/text: I've bought several varieties of Optimum Nutrition's whey protein, and I can definitely say that it's one of the best out there based on the results I saw when using it as a supplement. The powder also dissolves very well in liquids compared to other leading whey protein products and the taste is pretty darn good. That being said, I think some flavors are a little milder than others. The Double Rich Chocolate is one of the less flavorful in my opinion, so if you are looking for something sweeter, I would recommend Extreme Milk Chocolate. All in all, you really can't go wrong with ON.
