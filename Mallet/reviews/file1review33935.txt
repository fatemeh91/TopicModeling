review/text: I've been buying Zone Perfect Fudge Graham bars for years. They were a little bigger and more chewy than these new ones but they tasted great. However, the new ones I purchased (March 2007) are horrible. Like others have said they taste artificial. I think the chocolate they use has changed and is now too sweet.I guess Abbott Labs (who bought Zone Perfect in July 2003) wasn't making enough money on the original formula.
