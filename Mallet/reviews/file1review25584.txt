review/text: Let's face it, men of a certain age start to find the need for regular mowing of bits of our faces that previously needed none.The problem is the prospect of sticking conventional trimming devices up ones nose or down ones ears, ranks anywhere between terrifying and psychotic! Scissors up the nose? no way and the prospect of tweezing, jeeeeesh!!Then I found this, a buzzy little friend with a delicate head and no visible blades nor any which could harm skin but get them near tufty and furry facial cavities and they are back to their hairless days in no time. With this I can trim in minutes and no longer have to fear looking like a scarry guy who is going mouldy. One tip I would offer, after trimming your nose hairs thoroughly, blow your nose well to do what your barber does with the old neck brush!
