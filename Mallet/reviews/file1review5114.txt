review/text: I work out about 4 times a week and this stuff helps with recovers big time. And I have celiacs and this has never given me any trouble at all. I use this stuff after a work out and a Pure Fit bar about 1 hour before. Makes quite a difference for me. Just an FYI I don't lift heavy but I do a lot of core and cardio, don't know if that would affect how it works or not.
