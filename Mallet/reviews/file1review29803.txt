review/text: Got this as a gift for my sister and her bf they have bad allergies. My sister loves it and says it helps her breathe much better. He says he can't smell anything and it doesn't do anything, but he's always plugged up because of cat allergies so that's probably something this can't solve. Otherwise it seems to work for her!
