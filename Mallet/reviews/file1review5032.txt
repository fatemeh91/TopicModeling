review/text: Great for my skin, lousy for my wallet. I have tried Venus, Intuition, and a number of other pricey razors, and this is the one that's my match. I know women who feel the opposite way, so try before you buy a large quantity. This keeps getting more expensive, so I've tried new razors again, but I keep coming back to this.The blades last much, much longer on hair that's &lt; 1mm long. If I need to shave something longer and I have an older blade around, I'll swap them. Longer hair takes forever to rinse out, and even then it seems to end the blade, so I keep this to legs and underarms only. It has no problem with corse, thick hair.
