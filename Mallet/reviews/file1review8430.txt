review/text: It suits the purpose of all my glass bottles, for juicing and glass drinking bottles! The handle is bendy to allow you to work around the whole inside. I just love it, as I was a little skeptical if it would fit some of my narrow drinking bottles, ended ups fretted more than I needed to. Love it for the price point too!
