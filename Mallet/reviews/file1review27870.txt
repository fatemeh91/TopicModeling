review/text: I've used EAS 100% whey protein for years and it's been a great product, but I decided to give Gold Standard a try since the reviews on amazon were so high. I got it about a month ago and am very pleased with the quality of the powder. It tastes and mixes better than EAS 100% Whey. It's not near as thick and mixes pretty easily (couple minutes) in water. Tastes pretty good with vanilla soy milk too. Great product.
