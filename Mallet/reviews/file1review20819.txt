review/text: I had never used an electric razors. After reasearching this particular one though, I was sold. I decided to move to electric razors becuase I HATED shaving with blades. They left my skin feeling tight and really irritated my neck area. I have been using this shaver for a few weeks not and love it. It does a great job at every aspect of shaving. The only negative thing I have is that on some of the tough neckhairs you really have to work to get them out. You see everyone complaining about the price of the self cleaning solution. I only let it self clean after every other shave and that works fine. This solution will last me well past a month and I shave 3 times a week. Plus it leaves the razor with a fresh orange smell.Highly recommended.
