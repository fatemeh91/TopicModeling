review/text: They claim the product "helps relieve the discomfort of itching and dryness associated with athlete's foot while it cleans and refreshes skin." I have athlete's foot and this product has not relieved the discomfort and itching, nor has it even come close to refreshing the skin. Even though there are dozens of good reviews the product is weak and does not help. Don't be fooled!
