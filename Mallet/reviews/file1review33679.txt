review/text: I have sensitive teeth. I bought this only a week ago n have seen an improvement. At first it was a messy learning proccess (should come with goggles,lol) but once you learn it is not that messy. If you have sensitive teeth make sure you have the lurkwarm water (like it states in book to use). I have already notice a difference in my teeth.PROS- Works well. Easy to use (once you learn not to bathe yourself). Does get the stuff between your teeth. Multi setting allows you to control strength of water flow. For the price it is a nice deal. Place to hold up to 4 floss/tongue attachments.Fill tank also flips to cover unit to keep clean.CONS- Louder than you think it would be. The Pause button not really pratical (I always release it without thinking). Messy till you learn how to do it. Do Not overuse it or it will have adverse effects. Tank just a tad bit smaller than what I need for the 5-8 seconds per tooth (I need to refill it 1 time before I'm done).
