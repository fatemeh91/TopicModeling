review/text: I previously owned a Norelco trimmer that ran me about $50. When the Norelco finally broke down I decided to replace it within something inexpensive. So far so good. The Remington has done a great job replacing my previous trimmer. There seems to be more juice to the unit and more length settings for trimming. If you're in the market for an inexpensive trimmer that gets the job done, this is the one for you.
