review/text: I am a nursing student and I bought this stethoscope to learn with. It has not served me very well. It is heavy both in my pocket and around my neck. Also, (and more importantly) I cannot hear much with it. Everything is muffled. This is NOT a good stethoscope to learn on. Maybe it is okay for a person with a trained ear. I am personally switching to a Littmann. I need to hear!
