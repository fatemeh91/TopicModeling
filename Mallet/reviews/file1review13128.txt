review/text: I have had neck pain for a long time and have used ice packs and heating pads on and off. This product is very high quality and works well, because it holds tight to the place that you need it most. It doesn't hold cold/heat for an extraordinary amount of time (I don't ever use heat, but it stays cold for about a half hour), but it is well worth it.
