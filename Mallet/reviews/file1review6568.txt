review/text: I usually read about all of the reviews before I buy something so, I did the same thing before buying this item. The strange thing was, when I got this item, I found it to be nothing close to the 5 star reviews. during the past 12 years, I have been having a serious back pain usually once a year which kind of disable me for a week or two and sometimes it go away by itself and sometimes I have to have a muscle relaxing injection. so, when I saw the reviews, I bought this item and after using it for a long time and in many different ways, I found it to be more like a big joke. all it does, it press any place in your body. obviously , just pressing a place in your back alone doesn't fix and back problem and I say it since I have been having the back problem because of the muscle movement and have tried this tool in any possible way with no effect. at the same time, two years ago, I bought one of these little machines which after you sit on it, it hang you upside down. from the time I bought this machine, any time I got a back problem, I use this machine and hang upside down and do move a little to left and right and that's it, I have never had the same back pain any more. That is real, not based on a review but based on using something and then judging it so, I think this tool is useless and I won't recommend it to any one with any kind of back pain since it won't do you any good and it will be waste of your money.
