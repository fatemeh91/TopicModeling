review/text: Since I was a teenager (long long time ago) I have had to deal every summer with athlete's foot. It arrives with the hot and humid days, and does not truly go away even with daily washing and application of an over-the-counter anti-fungus cream and powder. It goes away with cooler weather.This year I saw the claims for Funga Soap and decided to try it. I've been using it in my nightly shower for 2 weeks now, followed by anti-fungus powder in the morning, and (dare I say it?) so far, not a peep out of the athlete's foot, in spite of very hot and very humid weather here in the northeast. It works for me!
