review/text: Beware! After purchasing this toy, I looked at the website of a local sex toy shop, and noticed an article on sex toy safety. They warn that since this, and other, toys are listed as 'novelty' items, they are unregulated by the FDA and may contain toxic materials that can cause cancers. One of the warning signs is a strong odor of rubber or plastic, which this toy definitely has, and the identification of the materials as 'jelly.' I can't return this item, but I wish I never bought it.
