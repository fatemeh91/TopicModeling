review/text: This product works like a dream! I won't go into any specific details, but my husband and myself are quite pleased with it.The reason I gave 4 stars not 5 was because of the mint flavored one. I would recommend being cautious with this one because it does have the menthol, cooling effect almost to the point of a little burning sensation.
