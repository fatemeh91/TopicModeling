review/text: With a 1-year old constantly grabbing my glass I decided to finally &#34;invest&#34; in some nice cleaning cloths for my eyeglasses as opposed to just using my shirt. These fit the bill perfectly. They are relatively inexpensive, come with a carrying pouch, and most importantly clean the lenses well.Most anti-reflective coating manufacturers (e.g. Crizal, etc) simply recommend regular water and a cloth like this to clean your lenses. No fancy lens sprays needed. I have found this to be true too. This cloth gets my lenses looking brand new.The carrying case could be improved by being able to close it so dust doesnt get in (its just a pouch with one side open ... no zipper or anything like that) but most of us will probably throw this cloth in our glasses case or similar anyways.I bought another one for my wife. Would recommend this product.
