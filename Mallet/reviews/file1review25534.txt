review/text: Well, this little guy Does pull on your nose and ear hairs, and if that doesn't bother you you're a better man than I GD. I admit to a bit of "yikes" now and then, but I Did discover that if you move the mower Slowly whilst hewing the internal forests it greatly reduces these little surprises. Having spent long years with scissors and mirror I Do feel that this is a great improvement. It is considerably faster in the nose mowing area, and I never did dare to explore my otic growth with any object sharper than a Q-tip. It's also quite comprehensive in its coverage, reaching well into all nooks and crannys. I now feel quite secure in my general appearance, and any person curious enough to take a gander into my facial orifices will find me nicely groomed and most presentable.
