review/text: I have used guai from Fludan for probably 5 years now for fibromyalgia. They are a great vendor. I used the powder for a while, but switched to the 600 mg capsules. Since the product base is powder, I think it appropriate to comment even though I got tired of stuffing my own capsules. (I do still have the equipment though to create my own capsules.)I order in bulk now and it lasts me probably a year at a time.Pay by check if you can, save the international conversion fees.I highly recommend Fludan's products. I have used a variety of 100% guai over the years from different vendors, and rate their product, customer service, and delivery the best.
