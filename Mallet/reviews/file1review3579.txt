review/text: I have been through several bottles of this stuff and it is by far the best I have ever used. Once it is applied you will not have to reapply (nothing like killing the mood to stop and add lube). I am in a committed relationship and we do not use condoms so I can not comment on how well it works with them. I have used this several times in the shower/bath and the results are all ways the same, silky smooth and never sticky. It can leave marks on the sheets but they come out easily in the wash.
