review/text: There are two basic pre-electric shave lotions on the market; one is green, this one is blue. This one works better for me. I've used it for twenty years, and I am finding it harder and harder to buy in stores, so I just bought a bunch of them on-line as a one time deal. The stuff will last forever if sealed (and kept in a cool dry place). It evaporates quickly, and it definitely makes the shaver flow over the skin more smoothly. I recommend it.
