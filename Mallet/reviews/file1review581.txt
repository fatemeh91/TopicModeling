review/text: Tried every kind of cholesterol meds and had a bad reaction to all (very bad body aches). Cholestene lowered my cholesterol dramatically and I have no bad reaction to it. Have been on it for over a year and it really works. All blood tests are good as well. But check with your own doctor to see what is appropriate for you.
