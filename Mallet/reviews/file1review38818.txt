review/text: I started using Slim Fast 23 years ago when I needed to lose weight after having my baby. I used it for a month and lost 8 pounds. After that, I used it, not to lose weight, but because I loved the taste of it. I actually put my milk in the freezer for about 45 minutes so it is icy cold. Then I mix in about a half a scoop of chocolate slim fast powder. It is so delicious -- to me, it tastes just like a FUDGECICLE (from my childhood days). ... And, the fact that there are so many nutrients included, is a plus! I strongly recommmend this product.
