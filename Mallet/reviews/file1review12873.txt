review/text: I have been suffering from migraines for the past 25 years and this is the first ice pack that I've gotten that really works. It feels great! I've had other ice packs but none that would stay on my eyes. This has a nice feel to it and it stays in place while I'm sleeping or resting my eyes. I would definitely recommend it.
