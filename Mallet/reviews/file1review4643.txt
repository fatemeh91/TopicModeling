review/text: When we moved into our new house we didn't realize that the washer was moldy. When the washer broke the repair guy showed me the pump and how it was full of mold. But even after we had the pump replaced a scent of mold still lingered in the laundry room. We tried leaving the fan on and that helped a bit. However it wasn't until we bought this odor absorbing gel that the scent of mold completely went away. Now when I open the laundry door I'm greeted with a lovely scent of honey and flowers. The only thing ocean about this gel is a slightly salty scent. This gel will freshen 400 square feet for 90 days. I love it and I think you will be amazed too.~The Rebecca Review
