review/text: My physical therapist had this exact model when I went to her for my wrist. She used this on me about 4 times and I was healed. So of course, I ran to amazon to get my own for all my body parts. I really do love it although it doesn't seem to get as hot as I'd like it to. Otherwise it feels GREAT!
