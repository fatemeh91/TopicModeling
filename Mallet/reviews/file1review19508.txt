review/text: My two year old granddaughter loves this. She can put it on the big potty by herself, and with her Baby Bjorn stool, hops right up, and seats herself with only a little assistance from me. It's comfortable for her, and she has great success, and feels very "big". (I also have the small, portable Baby Bjorn potty in pink, which she likes, too, as an alternative sometimes.) She likes to read her Mr. Rogers' book on going potty while she sits, so I know it's very comfortable for her. It has a great "tinkle shield" for little boys, but it doesn't get in her way at all. Wonderful design! Also, the toilet seat stores easily behind or beside the big toilet, so it doesn't take up any room in the bathroom when not in use. I just bought another one for her parents. Wonderful product as well as Great value for the money!
