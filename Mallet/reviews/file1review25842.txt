review/text: The taste/smell of this product is not what bothered me. In fact, though it kind of smells like bleach, I didn't think it really had any taste. My issue was that it simply didn't work. I got through the first two bottles (about a months worth) before I decided to give up. I didn't get any results for my breath and I also noticed that this stuff tore up the inside of my mouth. Sometimes I'd spit out what looked like pieces of flesh from inside my mouth or blood. My mouth felt clean, but no cleaner than normal mouthwash makes me feel. And my partner told me that regular mouthwashes were working better for my breath. Very disappointing.
