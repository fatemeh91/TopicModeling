review/text: The plastic seal was unopened but had powder all over the container when I took it out of the box. When I opened the lid the paper cover was already open. I do not know if it was already open or if it some how opened during the process of the delivery. It makes no sense why they would ship an open container. The time of shippment was good but the powder was all over the container and the second seal was open. The delivery was messy and the open cover seems suspicious, not sure if I should try it. Don't know how much powder was suppose to be in the container because the powder was all over the container therefore, I do not know how full it was initially. In general the delivery and presentation of the product was a dissapointment.
