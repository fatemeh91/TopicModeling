review/text: I rarely review my purchases. Nor did I ever think a scrub brush would make me so excited, but here I am. Reviewing and excited.The bristles seem sturdy and durable (I've only owned it for a day- will update in a few months). The handle provides a good grip, although I think it might be a bit short for larger hands. I have hands the size of an 8th grader's (I've checked), and it was just right for me.The brush did away with crud on my shower tub that I've been working at for years, as well as mildew and mold on an old shower curtain that I nearly gave up on (don't ask me why we kept it. I don't know). These are both things that I must have invested hours of time and energy on over the last five years with middling results, and with the brush I took care of them in less than half an hour.Color me amazed.
