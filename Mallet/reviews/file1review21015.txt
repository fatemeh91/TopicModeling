review/text: I have 3 different reachers. What I have found is that while one style may be great for one task, it will likely be bad at another. This is my favorite reacher of all three, and works for more tasks than others. I LOVE that it does not have the string system for pulling the jaws closed, and I LOVE the easier style "trigger" to operate it. I have MS and also have my spined fused 14 levels from T4-S1. I use a wheelchair, and among other things have hand weakness, torso weakness, and bending restrictions. This reacher easily allows me to reach a multitude of objects on the floor - from potato chips to my kid's toys to papers to clothes. It's great at most chores. I also love the extra long length that the reacher gives me versus most reachers. It does not work well to lift heavy objects - so if that's what you need I would recommend looking elsewhere. I also prefer one of my other reachers for laundry. But this reacher is lightweight, long, and easy to operate. I would highly recommend it!Rebecca
