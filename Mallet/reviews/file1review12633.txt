review/text: Granted, its no miracle pill it not like I lost 20 lbs in one session or anything. But it certainly does help you get rid of any unwanted colon build up and makes your tummy a lot less bloated looking. I have a VERY VERY sensitive digestive system so I was a lil afraid at first, but there is definately no uncomfortable stomach cramps, gas, or discomfort with these pills. Great product!
