review/text: I had received mine in a short time ONLY three days! It was packaged discreetly i didn't even know what it was till i opened it up. Its soft and the veins feel amazing It also has ALOT OF GIRTH! It does have a smell to it and i suggest you wash it before your first use but all in all I'm impressed.
