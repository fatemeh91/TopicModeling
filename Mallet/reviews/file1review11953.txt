review/text: The wife ran out of these Rainbow Light Just Once Prenatal pills earlier this week. We took the empty bottle to Walgreens, Safeway, CVS, etc and compared the nutritionial information, and were disappointed that the others either did not seem to be as potent as this one or did not contain natural ingredients like this one does. The wife didn't want those and also refused the heavily-discounted ones from our hospital. She's worried these will either not work as well or might make her nauseous, or they require more than one pill per day. She ABSOLUTELY insisted on this brand and ONLY this brand! So, I just bought a refill with one-day shipping to make sure it gets here tomorrow. That's how much she loves this.
