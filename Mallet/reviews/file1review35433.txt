review/text: We live in a hard water area and our dishwasher was looking pretty bad--hard water stains, squeaky drawers. I tried using a vinegar bath twice and it helped a little but still the stains were bad. I saw this product on the shelf at Walmart and thought, what could it hurt. On our first try, it almost restored the dishwasher to it's original condition. I was sold on this product right away. Dishwasher Magic will become a routine product that we use in our dishwasher. The slide out drawers almost lost their squeak, so I am pleased.Watsonville, California
