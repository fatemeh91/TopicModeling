review/text: I highly recommend this product from this seller. The glass jar is very sturdy I dropped it once on accident and nothing happened so im really about that. And when it arrived it was covered in a lot of bubble wrap to ensure that it doesn't get broken bcuz a lot of mail people don't care what's inside a package and will handle it however so im really happy about that
