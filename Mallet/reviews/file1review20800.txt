review/text: My husband switched to this after a Norelco rotary shaver. He says it gives him a better, closer shave. He usually got a lot of irritation with the rotary, but not with this one. The shaver holds its charge well and stays clean with the charger/cleaner system. He's had it almost two years and has had to replace the foil once. We buy cleaner liquid refills here on Amazon.-----Update 5/19/11The shaver still works great, no problems at all. EXCEPT if you have very good hearing like me, the charger makes a VERY high pitched sound constantly. It is not very loud. My husband can't hear it. However, I have to close the door to the bathroom so I can fall asleep at night. Most people probably wouldn't notice, but I thought I'd mention it.
