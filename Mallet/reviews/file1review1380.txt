review/text: I'm a large guy, and I just weighed in at DOCTOR at 346, he said "Lose weight." I got this scale to track my weight, set it up and guess what in less that a week, I'm 306, that's 38 pounds off the doctors scale. UNless these people call me to correct this complaint, I got RIPPED OFF BY DETECTO. What it detects is INNACURASY.VERY UNHAPPY, DON'T BUY IT!
