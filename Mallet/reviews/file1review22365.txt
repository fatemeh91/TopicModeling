review/text: I like that the pads fit closely. I was not terribly concerned about &quot;smushing&quot; the corners of my contoured changing pad. If it were any larger would bother me if it slid around. I think a tight fit is safer (a wiggly baby can't losen it at all.) I love mine and bought them as shower gifts for friends too!
