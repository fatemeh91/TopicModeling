review/text: I was skeptical about spending this much for a shaver, but I have been sufficiently unhappy with previous cheaper shavers that I took the plunge. Let me just say, I LOVE this shaver. It is fast, very comfortable and gives a GREAT shave. I plan on buying a second one for my vacation home, I like it that much.
