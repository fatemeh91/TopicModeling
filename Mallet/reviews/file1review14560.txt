review/text: I really liked this creme. It has a wonderful scent and a little goes a LONG way! I actually used this on some other areas as well, like my elbows and knees. It worked just as well there. The only thing that I didn't like was that it took a little too long to be absorbed. I put it on my feet before bed and it felt a little sticky. I felt that I need to wear socks with it on. I used a little less the next night and only in certain spots and had better results.
