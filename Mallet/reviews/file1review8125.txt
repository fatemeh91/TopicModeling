review/text: The low cost, the size of the blade, and the comfortable handle make this a good buy. And the suction cup hanger is functional, simple, and satisfying. The down side is using it on a shower and tub with curves. I've found that the curves have warped or bent the ends of the rubber blade. This makes it harder to squeegee and it happened only after a few days of use. The product is still functional, but less so now. This might be a problem for all similar squeegees. Another down side is that someday this thing will most likley end up in a landfill. In hind site, I wish that I had sought out a product that had a greater chance of being recycled or biodegrading. While in many cases a squeegee seems to be less expensive and wasteful alternative to shower sprays, more need to be designed with a functional replaceable blade, which this product does not have.
