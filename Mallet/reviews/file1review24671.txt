review/text: I recommend this product with the caveat that everyone reacts differently to supplements. I had no adverse reactions to Zantrex. I had hit a weight loss plateau, and used Zantrex to help me break through the plateau and lose the next 10 lbs. I have been taking this product for 4 months now. Overall I have lost 23 lbs, the last 13 with the help of Zantrex. I have noticed that if I do not take it for a few days, my weight creeps up a few pounds - as soon as I resume, it creeps back down. I also use diet (no sugar, low carbs) and exercise (walking 2-3 miles a day) to help maintain my healthy weight. I am a size 8 again and have no complaints.
