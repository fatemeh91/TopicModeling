review/text: I got the 36 pack of Okamoto Crown condoms so that I could hide them in my roommate's bag (and maybe prevent pregnancy). In the meantime, I decided to try them out.These are better than any Durex condoms I've tried, and at least on par with Trojan. They have fantastic lubricant, and they don't smell strongly of latex.I'd recommend these to anyone of average size. While they may accommodate a larger size, these are probably not comfortable for the extremely well-endowed.
