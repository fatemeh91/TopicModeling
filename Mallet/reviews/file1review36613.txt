review/text: This was the first ankle brace I have ever purchased, so when I went looking for one on the internet all I saw awas a multitude of options. I needed a brace for my daughter who is an 8th grader playing basketball - she has a recurring ankle issue where she will roll her ankle and sprain it casuing much pain and grief. This brace has been nothing short of amazing for her. It is lightweight and comfortable. She only wears it on one ankle, yet when I ask her if she notices it compared to the other foot, she does not. She loves it, and it is doing the job for her so dad is happy - well worth the small investment.
