review/text: I did the 7 day cleanse last week and found that 6 capsules works best for me. The directions said it works with your stomach acid, so if you don't see results then take the capsules with a little lemon juice squeezed in water. This is the most effective product I've tried for constipation. I feel much better overall without the cramping that fiber gives me. I'd recommend trying OxyPowder.
