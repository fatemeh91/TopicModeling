review/text: IDEAL LARGE CAPSULE - BUT NOT FOR VEGETARIANSIf you don't need to make a huge number of capsules [also available in 750 per package], these are the same excellent capsules NOW Foods uses for their own products. This size "00" will hold up to 1000 mg. of herbal, vitamin or amino acid products [depending on the density] and is the largest size capsule most people can swallow easily. The only larger size is "000" which can hold about 1 teaspoon and causes many people to gag. They work perfectly with the "capsule machine" sold through Amazon and are a terrific value. Of course you have to have the size of capsule that exactly fits the capsule machine as they generally only will handle 1 size. Just bear in mind that these are Gel-Caps, not "V-Caps" if you are a vegetarian. Great quality! Recommended!These are also available through Amazon in quantities of 750 capsules for a savings of about 12-15% per unit.
