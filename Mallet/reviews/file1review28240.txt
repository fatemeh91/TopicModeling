review/text: The product mixes well and tastes really good. I'm very satisfied with the purchase and plan to try other flavors (I started with vanilla) For those who are lactose intolerant, it does contain the lactase enzyme, but it could probably use a little bit more. I think the product mixes better than the Designer Whey product.
