review/text: i have an ulcer. this pepogest really hurt my stomach. it says to take on an empty stomach but i may try to take it with food. but i'm scared to because it really burns. i've never tried peppermint oil caps before so i didn't know it would do this before i bought it. it may work for ibs idk.
