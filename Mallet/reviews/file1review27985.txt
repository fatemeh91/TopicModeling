review/text: I first bought the Cookies N' Cream version of the Optimum whey. It gave me great results by helping speed up my recovery time, and I truly did notice a difference in my muscle development after starting to use it. However, the taste of Cookies n' Cream isn't really that great and small cookie bits can be annoying. However, I later tried the double chocolate flavor and it really does taste like real chocolate, and is something you can really enjoy. But in the end I guess it's all about personal taste, it seems that some of the other reviewers liked the cookies n' cream but not the chocolate.On a side note; Taking protien shakes does not develop your muscles, or give them an complexion or even make you bigger. It all depends on the type of workout you have. You grow outside of the gym not inside the gym, however, muscles need to be repaired after a good workoutm and that's what protiens do. They repair damaged muscles and strengthen them, and at the same time make them bigger.
