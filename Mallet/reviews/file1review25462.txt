review/text: I've tried a lot of different nose/ear trimmer even the lighted Panasonic ER421KC trimmer. That one rips your hair out and runs out of batteries quickly. I did like the trimmers that they show on TV that have a little trimmer on one side but those get disgusting after using them for a while even if you wash them off and they bog down easily. I got fed up and bought this and I was VERY pleased. It is fast and powerful. They use to make a water proof version but I cant find it. Try this one you won't regret it.
