review/text: The Oral-B Super Floss is a very professional product. It consists of two parts: a stiff endpiece, and a piece of dental floss that's one-fourth thick and three-fourths thin. The thin floss has a very nice mint flavor. The thick part is wonderful because it has a texture, and feels like it actually rubs and cleans your teeth. But it's not meant for very tight spaces. Although it probably won't shred, it will hurt your fingers as you try to pull it through your teeth. The stiff endpiece can serve as a thin toothpick. You can use it either for braces or just to get between the teeth. The only negative thing is that the thin floss could be a little more shredproof. Overall, I'd recommend this product.
