review/text: These plates are &#34;okay.&#34; I bought them to use for a shower, but was a little disappointed. What drew me to buy them was the quantity, as I did not want to buy clear plates in small sets. They are little flimsier than the clear plastic plates I'm used to, and I thought the edge/border made them look cheap. I ended up still using them for the shower because I really didn't have another option, but would have liked something more simple and sturdier.
