review/text: Taste is really good. If you're using water, keep it down to about a 1 1/3 cups for 2 scoops. If you're using milk, 2 cups is good. As always, if you add fruit to it, less milk would be good, but water should always be 1 1/3 cups for 2 scoops. The taste is good, it can get old after awhile though. Regardless, it's a good product. I've seen some improvements, and i recommend it.
