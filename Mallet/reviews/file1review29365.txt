review/text: This is a STIMULANT laxative. Of course it is going to cause you pain!!! This is the same drug prescribed by surgeons when they want an empty bowel. Yes it will give you cramps because it is stimulating and literally squeezing everything out!Pure dulcolax laxative is very strong and always has been. If you really really need to make sure you can evacuate, this IS the drug for you. Gentle is really misleading however.If you want less suffering, try a laxative that says stool softener. But don't blame the drug itself, it is only doing what it is intended to do.If there were reviews for chemotherapy people would give only one star. Of course it will make your hair fall out and make you nauseated and sick as never before. But that is what it does. Do your research before buying something.Yes, this will cause a bowel movement and you will feel like someone is punching you in the stomach.
