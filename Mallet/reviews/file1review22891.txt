review/text: We use this Sweeper at work where we usually open ceiling tiles and all the dust and "crumbs" of those tiles fall onto the carpet. This product does an excellent job of cleaning that debris up without the use of loud, heavy and often times frustrating vacuums that you need to find a power outlet for. This product has been a convenient life saver for us and shortens our clean up time significantly.My only gripe is that its quite smaller than the industrial sized Huskee brand sweepers we see some of the janitors use. Its about 2/3 the size of those but it still works quite well. Also, I had to tape the detachable handle poles together so they wouldn't come apart.It does ok on hard floors but its great on carpet.
