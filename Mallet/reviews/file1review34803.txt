review/text: We love this product - have purchased it at the local co-op many times. When I saw it on Amazon for a great price, I jumped to order it! I'm not sure I'd order it from Amazon again, though - the box arrived drenched in leaking laundry detergent. All four bottles had opened and leaked during shipping, causing a huge mess. Another review reported a similar problem, and I chose to ignore it - but the review was right, the single corrugated box just doesn't hold up for shipping a product like this.
