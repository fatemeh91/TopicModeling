review/text: Being a plus size woman it is difficult to find products in stores to help you with your problems. Thanks to the internet I was able to find a XXX size knee support. I've only used it one day so far. I wore it to work yesterday. With the type of fabric that it is it provides a little warmth. It would have worked a bit better for me if it came up slightly higher above my knee on the top. At first there was a slight pinch behind my knee. I tried repositiong it slightly & it helped some. After it was on for a little bit it was better. It fit quite comfortably underneath my jeans without showing bulges. I wore it from morning nearly all day at work. Eventually I took it off. It doesn't have any hard supports along the outer sides of the knee which is why I chose it because I knew I needed to sit all day. It provices a relatively gentle support so if you're looking for something to hold your knee more straight this would not be the product for you. It is what I was looking for.
