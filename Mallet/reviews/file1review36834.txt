review/text: This is an excellent product and works great. It has one fatal flaw you need to know about. The stitching will fail on you. Either the straps will tear off or the hem stitching holding the plastic inside of the cloth sleeve will tear out. The manufacturer needs to specify a stronger thread and/or more passes of the machine.As a consumer you can avoid this happening with a two prong approach. First get very stretchy socks or oversized socks. Pulling tight mostly cotton socks will guarantee failure. Also not a bad idea to buy two at once.Product says right on it that it cannot be returned for sanitary/health reasons.
