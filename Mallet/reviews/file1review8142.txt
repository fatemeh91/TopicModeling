review/text: I feel kind of funny getting excited about a brush, but this thing just tore through a very dirty job. I bought this to clean a bath tub that had not been cleaned in 1.5 years... as you can imagine it was pretty gross. The OXO brand usually makes quality products, and this is no exception. The build is very strong, the grip is nice and grippy, and the size of the brush makes it very versatile. The dimensions make it easy to scrub both large areas and harder to reach places.For the price, this is a no brainer... will probably be buying more in the future.
