review/text: In my opinion, Always maxi pads are the best brand of pads on the market. The ""dri-weave"" covering on the pads wicks moisture away while keeping the surface of the pad dry. I recommend the entire line of Always maxi pads, which I've used for more than 15 years. These pads work well overnight -- they're longer than the average pad. They're also great for postpartum use. Always is the only brand I ever purchase and I'm pleased.
