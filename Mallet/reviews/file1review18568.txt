review/text: I was amazed at how quickly my cuff arrived, it came in less than a week. The cuff fits perfectly and is easy to position. It does take two hands or a chin to pull the cuff tight, but that is a small price to pay for taking my blood pressure at home instead of running to the doctors office all of the time. I highly recommend this product and I will surely buy from this vendor again.
