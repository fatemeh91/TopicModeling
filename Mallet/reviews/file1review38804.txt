review/text: I've been using these shakes on and off for six years. Like others, I switched to the mix powder when the ready-to-drink shakes went from 12 ounces to 10 ounces. The shake tastes fine with just the powder and milk. But adding a tablespoon of peanut butter gives it a little extra kick that I love. I've also added a banana to the shake and been quite satisfied. Both variations of the shake make me feel like I'm not drinking a diet shake. If you're counting on using these shakes as meal replacement without snacks, I'd advise against it. After three hours I start to need a little something. At these times, I like to eat a few crackers, some dried fruit, a few slices of cheese, some peanuts, or a packet of fruit snacks. There are more nutricious choices, but my choices of snacks is what keeps me from eating too much. And that's what matters in the end.
