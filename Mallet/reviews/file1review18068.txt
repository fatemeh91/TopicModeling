review/text: My husband and I have different sleep schedules and different work schedules. I have always had a need for an eye mask that blocks out light, comfortably. This mask is as close to perfect as I can find. I still get a tiny bit of light seeping in, if I'm laying on my side. I find this mask very comfortable and can end up sleeping all night with it on without even noticing!
