review/text: I understand this product may not be for everyone, but it works very well for me. How do I know? I have used this successfully for myself & my children to avoid the flu for years. When I didn't realize my youngest (5) at the time had the flu-even tested positively-I began giving this to her right away, one dose every 6 hours & she recovered very quickly. I thought she had an ear infection. Now, I just give it whenever any one of them or I begin to get a cold, etc. I LOVE it. I always keep a few boxes. I do not get the flu shot. I hope it works for your family!
