review/text: Therapy is one of Lush's longtime products, and once you smell it, you'll see why. Therapy's scent is a mix of neroli and lavender, which is both beautiful and calming at the same time. Therapy truly has that complex "spa-like" smell. So, what does one do with a massage bar? Well, one can use it for massage, obviously, but don't let infrequent massages keep you from purchasing one. There's lots of other uses for them too. You can rub it on and let it sink in to use as a moisturizer, or you can shave off a little bit and let it melt in your bath water. I've found it's a bit too greasy for my taste to use as a lotion, so I use it in the tub. I rub a layer on, rinse off, and pat dry. The massage bar leaves a nice cocoon of moisture behind. And just to reiterate: it really does smell great.
