review/text: I bought this as soon as we put our 2yr old in a regular bed. He is still in diapers but takes water to bed and sweats a ton (even with no blankets and light pj's) It has kept the mattress perfectly clean and dry. It does not feel like plastic or make noise and has been very durable. good quality. I will buy another when the next kid gets a twin bed.
