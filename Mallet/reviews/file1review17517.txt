review/text: When I opened this trimmer the inside plastic bag was torn open and there were cut beard hairs in the blades. Naturally, I returned it, but it's annoying for me to have to do that when I ordered a supposedly new product. Also, I wonder why Amazon is not refunding my postage. Now I have to chase that down. In their defense, this is the first time (and hopefully only) that something like this has happened to me.
