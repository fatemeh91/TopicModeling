review/text: When I first heard of homeopathy I thought it was some kind of new fashionable thing that will go away soon. But I thought I should go and read some more. However, I didn't go that far reading how exactly specific remedies were being prepared.Still sceptical I tried Oscillococcinum when I was really sick and it put me back on my feet in a day. Since then I always keep a pack nearby and take it when I feel the first signs of flu.What I like best is that there are no side effects and as with all homeopathic substances you can never overdose.I recommend this remedy to everyone.It works best if you can avoid coffee, alcohol and mint toothpaste while taking it.
