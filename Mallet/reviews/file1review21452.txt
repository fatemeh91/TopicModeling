review/text: I got the Sonic Complete toothbrush as a door prize back in 2008 and have not been able to find replacement toothbrush heads in the store for over a year now. I had enough supply to get me through and recently opened my last one. I was SOOO EXCITED to find these on Amazon and that they are available as a subscribe and save product at such a great price!
