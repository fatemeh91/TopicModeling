review/text: I bought this primarily on price (secondarily based on reviews) to replace my Philips unit that died many months back. After going without and electric toothbrush my exams got progressively worse, so I began shopping around for a new unit. This one works well; no surpises. It feels different than the Sonicare - more aggressive to my senses. It's easier to clean and dry, and the LCD battery level indicator is nice (no surpises).No regrets buying it.
