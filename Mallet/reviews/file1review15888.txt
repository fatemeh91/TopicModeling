review/text: I thought this will not really live up to what its advertisement says because it looks so compact and priced cheaply than the other maternity supports, but it has prevented me from having back pains. I am only 18 weeks along, but I have a physically demanding job. I do not know if it will continue to be effective when I get further along. As of this time, I enjoy using it because my back feels good, I can use it under my work clothes and it is so easy to don. I can feel the difference in how my back feels if I do not wear it.
