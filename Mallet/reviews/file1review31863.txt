review/text: I've used a few premium balms such as this from AOS, Wm. Neumann & Co., and Truefitt & Hill. Out of the three, it's hands down Wm. Neumann & Co. followed by Truefitt & Hill and AOS a close third. But compared to many, all three are the best you can get, IMHO. I think the difference lies in the herbs and extracts in the Wm Neumann & Co Balms that make it the best for me.I have the AOS Balm in Lavender and Sandalwood. Both are very nice and I have them in my rotation despite my preference with the other two mentioned; The variety is nice.You can't go wrong with this from AOS. I like it, and you probably will too!
