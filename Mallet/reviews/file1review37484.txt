review/text: Cats, dogs, puppies - we love them but they sure make the most obnoxious messes! Cats are especially bad as they not only have the "hairball" issue going on but if they aren't well or if they don't like something about their litter box, they will find an alternative place "to go". What's worse, is once they've done that they are likely to return to that spot again in the future if the need presents itself because it will retain their odor.Bissell's Pet Odor and Stain remover is essential for really cleaning up pet messes of all kinds and goes a LONG way toward eliminating their smells from areas that do no belong to them. For really bad cases I use this cleaner first and follow it up with a some Nature's Miracle or similar product.Lastly, if you have a couch or bed in your home that has absorbed too much "body odor" from a member (or members) of your family, this solution does wonders to break down the oils and remove the ingrained dirt and odors. In my opinion, teenagers count as "pets" too!Really, this is why you bought that expensive machine in the first place, isn't it? (This product works in just about any steamer type carpet cleaner - doesn't have to be a Bissell!)
