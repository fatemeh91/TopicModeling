review/text: Bought this after I lost my littmann. Seems to perform just as well as my lost +$100 stethoscope but at a fraction of the price. There is a slight compromise in build quality, the tubing that inserts onto the bell can be rotated pretty easily when I remember my littmann feeling more sturdy. However, it performs great and when stethoscopes are easily misplaced or stolen in hospitals this is a great option so next time your out a stethoscope you arent paying another 100 dollars.
