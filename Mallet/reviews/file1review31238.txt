review/text: The product was two weeks from expiring and he knew I could not use them up in two weeks and still sent the two boxes I ordered.and packed them together and still charged me $6.95 a box. I sent him an e-mail and he was rude he told me they were given to him and he thought someone could use them at only $0.25 a box but charged me $13.90 shipping when he sent them together for only $2.73 for both. He went on to tell me that is what Amazon recommended to charge for shipping. He should have put the expiration date on the description of the lancets I would not have ordered them at all with only two weeks before they expired. I also ask him to refund and pay too return well I still have them and he has my $14.40.
