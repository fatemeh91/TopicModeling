review/text: That about says it for me. I have tried many protein bars over the years and these are my favorite. I stay with the low sugar high protein variety bars; sometimes I have to eat half of these at a time because they are so high in protein; and definitely drink water with these. but I don't find these to have that annoying after taste of other bars
