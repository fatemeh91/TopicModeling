review/text: But I don't know of any product that does. This contains three, although it is best to take all four. It is missing hydroxycobolamine which I take as drops by InterPlexus.After being diagnosed with pernicious anemia about 10 years ago and on daily B12 shots for months, I can not risk not taking supplements. Most adults have lost the intrinsic factor in the gut allowing absorption of pill forms, so sublingual or liposomal sprays are better, or at least liquid forms. I don't have a lot of brand loyalty but figure that experimenting around will get me what I need.If you are experiencing depression, fatigue, hair loss it is worth experimenting to see if these water-soluble vitamins will help you. For years I took just one form and didn't experience much benefit until I discovered all four forms are necessary. Folic acid and B6 help metabolize the B12 correctly.UPDATE: CELIAC ALERT: Although it does not say so in the description, the bottle does state that it is manufactured in a facility that processing other items with the allergens stated on the bottle. I called the company where I spoke with a nutritionist who assured me that this is not only safe, but confirmed that this formulation is one of the best on the market for celiacs to take. B12 deficiency (pernicious anemia) is EXTREMELY serious and potentially life-threatening as the part of the small intestine most compromised by gluten is where B12 and other nutrients are metabolized. With two celiacs in the family I am constantly on the alert!The taste reminds me of B vitamins, (it reminds me of the old Flintstone chewable vitamins I took as a child) so like all water soluble vitamins, it is better to take these after a meal so they don't upset your stomach. I've only taken them once.
