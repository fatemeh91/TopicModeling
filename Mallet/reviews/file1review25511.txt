review/text: I received my Panasonic ER411 today and the seconds I stick it into my nose and hear the trimming noise I know i have a winner. I have try the other sub $$ products I got at the retail store and they just couldn't do a 'clean' job. I have small nose holes but the size fits in just fine. I orignially bought it only for my nose hair because I do not have ear hair that I know of. Out of curiosity I put it in my ears and to my surprise, the trimming noise starts and took out the ear hair that I didn't know about.It feels good when sometimes you award yourself with these little life helpers.
