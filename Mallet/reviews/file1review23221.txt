review/text: Bought this sweeper to clean 3 large tufted wool area rugs and not have to take out the vacuum cleaner every time. One reviewer had mentioned it did well with cat's hair and it influenced my choice (I have 2 cats). The sweeper is easy to use and I had no problem with the handle. However, I need many passes over the same area to remove the cats' hair. I think the sweeper would work perfectly fine with low carpet, with high pile rug however, it requires patience. I still love the sweeper, light and easy to use and very cheap.
