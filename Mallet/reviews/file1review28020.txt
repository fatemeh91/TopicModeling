review/text: Best tasting and mixing whey protein for the price. Most of my friends actually think it's chocolate nesquick. I've always had a hard time putting muscle on even with this stuff. I just burn to many calories and don't eat enough. Anyways, I've had a lot of success with keeping my muscle mass even with not weight lifting since I've been busy with jiu jitsu and road biking. Thumbs up from me.
