review/text: I've bought the cane 2 months ago and I consider it the best product I ever had for my back pain. It's inexpensive and very effective not only for low back pain. I am using it after sitting long hours in front of computer or after "bad" night sleep. It took only 5 or 10 minutes a day and pain that I had more than 2 years gone. Amazing tool!
