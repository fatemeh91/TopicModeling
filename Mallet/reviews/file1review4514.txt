review/text: I usually use a Gillette Sensor with 2 blades (although my latest pack has 3 blades) and I'm generally happy with it. I visited my friend couple of days ago and I had to borrow his razor, which was the Fusion. The problem with this blade (and also the Quattro, and also to some degree the 3 bladed razors) is that because the blades are so close together, the cut hair gets stuck between the blades more easilly. This requires more time rinsing between strokes, so it overall doesn't save you time shaving.And these cartridges are rather expensive, so I try to use it as long as possible - which means that it's important to get the hair out of the blades before it dries onto it.I think that the overall increase in size of the blades (compared to the 2 blade Sensor Excel) helps in shaving large parts of skin, like legs or whatever. But when it's your face with its nooks and crannys, I prefer the smaller blade that can get close to crevasses without exerting too much effort. The 6th blade feature was OK, but didn't feel like it was worth it.Remember, that with any NEW blade, you will get an awesome shave. People that wrote reviews for this product could have only just recently got it, because it actually came out only a week or so ago - so they're reviewing what is essentially a NEW blade.edit----Recently got this as a gift. Same problems as listed before. I'll just use it until I run out of blades.
