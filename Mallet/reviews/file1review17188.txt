review/text: Couldn't be happier with this. Read some negative reviews before purchasing, so was concerned at first, but well worth the price (which is extremely low in my opinion, offering a great value). Powerful, and the length adjustments really stay in place, with no additional parts. The only issue is you have to be careful what angle you hold it at, or else it will cut shorter than you may want at longer lengths.
