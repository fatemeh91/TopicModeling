review/text: I've had my Braun 8595 for over two years now. It's worked very well without anything falling apart on me. I previously had gone through two Remingtons in less than one year. Braun recommends replacing the cutterblock every 18 months but I let it slide to 24. I definitely have noticed a little improvement over shave time. Don't feel that you need to replace the cutterblock in exactly 18 months... if you're not having any shaving irritation or note any significant delay in shaving time, delay your purchase.
