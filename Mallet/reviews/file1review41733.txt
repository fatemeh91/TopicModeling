review/text: The Oral-B Triumph was an excellent purchase. The toothbrush signals the user that it is time to move to the next section for cleaning. This is definitely good because there may be a tendency to over brush. It also lets the use know when brushing is complete. I think this is a good tool because I don't recall anyone telling me how much time is needed to brush each section of the mouth. At least with this function in place I know how long to spend brushing my teeth.I have noticed that my teeth are more plaque free compared to manual brushing.
