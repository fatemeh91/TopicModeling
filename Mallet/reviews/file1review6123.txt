review/text: This salve smells great and really heals wounds. It is also very soothing and an excellent pain reliever for cuts. A good friend from Australia introduced me to it (she let me use hers on a bad cut) and I had to purchase my own. Every medicine chest should have it. I love and highly recommend Herbal Ed's Salve.
