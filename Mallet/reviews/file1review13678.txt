review/text: Personally, I just about live on these. I generally have a couple in the morning before class, either of these or Warp Green Lemon Lime "mints", depending how much caffeine I think I need (the Warp ones are a little less caffeinated).A hint to the uninitiated: one of the nice things about mints, etc. is that is you can keep them under your tongue: "sublingual infusion" is the term for this (absorbing the caffeine through the blood vessels on the bottom of your tongue), and I find it not only works better, but comes on slower (not a sudden jolt to your system, e.g. less jitters), and lasts longer. Your mileage may vary :)Bottom line: get these mints. If you want to buy a smaller quantity, thinkgeek sells them individually.
