review/text: I use this brush to clean narrow-necked, glass bottles; stainless-steel, sports water bottles; glass carafes; and 16-ounce, tall, water glasses that are too narrow for my hand to fit inside.This has a really nice rubber grip. The bristles are firm enough to clean well, but not so hard they aren't flexible.Highly recommended!
