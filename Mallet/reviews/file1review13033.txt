review/text: I've had this Cervical gel pack now for a few months and it has been great! No leaking, soft and flexible and can be used for lower back for laying down. I've turned it vertically to go down the length of my spine and works like a charm. Highly recommend this for anyone that needs a good ice pack or uses daily because it holds up very well and the velcro is very useful at times.Just remember to keep it in the plastic zip bag it comes with or use a freezer quart bag to store in. Will purchase again when this one starts wearing out, but it is holding up much better than any other ice pack I've ever had. With neck problems and back problems for 2/3 of my life, an ice pack is something I always have more of one of on hand. This one is a winner all the way!
