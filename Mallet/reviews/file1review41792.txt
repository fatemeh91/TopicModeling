review/text: When I went to my dentist every time, she told me I am not brushing my teeth properly. I had 6 fillings last year and a bridge this year. When I asked her, if a electronic brush would help and asked her if Philips sonicare is a good one, she told me I might want to try this one. And voila, this one is great. Though I dont like to flush everyday, I always did with reluctance. But since I started using this brush, I saw I can actually flush once in 2 days.. I like it very much it cleans well, reaches every cornoer of my teeth and though it does not replace flush, it does some of the flush action too. So highly recommended.
