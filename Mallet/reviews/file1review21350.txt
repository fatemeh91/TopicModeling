review/text: Oral-B Sonic Replacement Brush Head (3 ct.)this is one of the orginal sonic appliances but as long as I can obtain the brushes (no longer available in stores, hence one is forced to buy a new appliance at a healthy cost) I will continue to use it. Works great. I was pleased with the fast delivery and product was exactly what I ordered.
