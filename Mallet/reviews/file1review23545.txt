review/text: I've been using this for about a month now and it's exactly what I was looking for. I didn't want to spend much more than $20, and you would never guess it cost so little based on the appearance - it is sturdy and made from great quality materials. The light has 3 strength levels but I only ever use it on high. It's not bright enough to use in a pitch-dark room, but if you have any other lighting in the room, it should be fine (my room is a cave and it's still bright enough). I like the fact that it has two sides and both are lighted. The regular side is perfect for applying makeup, while the magnified side is great for plucking your eyebrows or other tasks that require a close-up view.The only downside is the the touch sensor on the base. I'm always accidentally brushing against it and turning it off, which can get annoying. That's the only reason why I'm rating this a 4 and not a 5.
