review/text: this battery has been hard to find for us in our local area, and when we did find it, the price was over 2X the price quoted on Amazon. The product was delivered quickly, was from a name brand mfg., so we're completely satisified.it's also nice not to have the little light on our dual alarm clock that says &#34;replace battery&#34; blinking at me all night!
