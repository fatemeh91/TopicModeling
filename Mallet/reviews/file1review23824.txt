review/text: I purchased 2 boxes a couple years ago and they were great. Really tough. Zero gloves ripped under normal use, even after sitting in the box for a year. I would show them off to other people by sticking a slotted screwdriver in them and stretching out the glove which would not rip! Amazing! So I bought more. What a difference! 10% to 20% of the new gloves tear either when putting them on(!) or in light normal use. One box I have at hand right now is Lot # 52010690210-L1. I often use toluene, industrial epoxies and other strong adhesives I really don't want on my skin (these also require wearing a respirator), so it matters to me that these fail so easily and so often. Maybe this is just a lapse in quality control? Both boxes have 10-20% failures. I am switching to another brand: trying Cobalt this time.
