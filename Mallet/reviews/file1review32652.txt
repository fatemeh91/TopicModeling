review/text: I was introduced to the acai berry thru a iridologist. I took the monavie for 3 months. It worked really well. I googled acai berry and found this product and ordered some. I can not tell any difference with this and the monavie except the price. I am now on my second jar of the powder and will not go back to monavie. If you are looking to try some of this I would highly recommend it.
