review/text: I have gotten multiple of this product and it never ceases to amaze me! I was considering getting the hydrowhey from the same company but I realized from other reviews that its basically the same and the scoop is bigger so actually when they say it has more protein, it actually dosen't... it has just a little more protein per serving but not too much more! I'd rather get this one its cheaper and I can drink more scoops and it'll last longer for me. I got mocha cappuchino and the taste blew me away! With milk it tasted just like a mcdonalds iced cappuchino! Amazing product!
