review/text: I used the Good News disposable razor on my legs and was pleased with the smooth, close shave. I usually use a single blade disposable and the double blade of the Good News gives a smoother shave. I think the price of these razors is rather high for a disposable -- and they don't last for as many shaves as the single edge. Overall, I was pleased and will probably buy them again if they're on sale, but they probably won't replace my regular disposable.
