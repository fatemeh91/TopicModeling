review/text: In today's fast paced world, we can sometimes neglect to take care of ourselves as well as we should. I use Green Vibrance to supplement my diet. I love this product. The ingredients in it seem very healthy, kinda like those vegetables I haven't got around to eating. When I take Green Vibrance, I really feel like I'm taking care of myself, that's a good feeling.Protip: Don't use a ton a juice when mixing. I made this mistake, using way too much cranberry juice. It's better to take a big scoop with less juice. It makes it easier to drink and it's better not having to drink a ton of sugar. Good luck!
