review/text: I just received my sample of this product from the manufacturer (they were giving bars away on their website). This is the perfect snacking bar, dense and full of dried fruit. I'm not a big fan of the thick, chalky "meal replacement" bars that have 150-250 calories and leave you hungry again with a nasty aftertaste lingering in your mouth. These are a great, healthy way for me to snack at work and be satisfied yet still have an appetite for dinner when I get home.The nutritonal contents aren't too bad, either. 140 calories, 6g fat (no trans), 16g carb, 3g fiber, 11g sugars. I can live with that.
