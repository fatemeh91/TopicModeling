review/text: I sufferred from moderate acne as a teenager. After having fairly clear skin in my 20's, my acne started back up as I turned 30. I went to a facialist who started me on Dermalogica products. She promised me that my skin would clear up in about 2 weeks. It did! I've been using this cleanser for 10 years now, and it's the best I've ever used. I have very sensitive, fair skin, and tends toward the oily side. I'll never switch to another skin care line. It may seem expensive, but one 16 oz bottle lasts me for over a year, and you don't need more than a pea size amount, so I believe it's cheaper than most drug store products. I have also used the daily microfoliant (awesome) and their moisturizers. I cannot think of a better product anywhere.
