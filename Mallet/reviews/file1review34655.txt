review/text: I have used a lot of NOW brand products, and was always happy with them. The Virgin Coconut Oil is good, but it's not premium. I only have Nutiva to compare it to, but the Nutiva wins hands down for texture and aroma. However, if you want a good, inexpensive VCO, NOW brand is fine. It lasts forever without going rancid, even kept on a countertop.
