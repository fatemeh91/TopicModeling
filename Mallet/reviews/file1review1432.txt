review/text: Based on the other review, I was very excited to try this product despite the cost. (Our diaper champ has been in use for two years now and we have to light candles to mask the odor of some diapers.) The spray has a pleasant odor, but it's power just doesn't last - and you have to use quite a lot of sprays on the offending diaper.
