review/text: I love it, but the "j" shaped openings don't seem as big as on one I used at physical therapy. I am a pretty big guy so I would have liked to see the openings a bit bigger to reach my trigger points.That being said, it is a great tool and I would buy it again in a second, it was worth every penny for trigger point relief in my mid to upper back and under the edge of the scapula.
