review/text: This doesn't work on the City Select stroller. I love the idea, it isn't very big though.I don't know if the City Select is considered a single or double stroller as it can be both, but the Baby Jogger website says that it works with the City Select and on the outside of the box is says that it isn't compatible with the City Select.
