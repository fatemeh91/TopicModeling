review/text: The points allow you to work on exposing in-grown hair. But the tips barely touch so it's very difficult to grasp the hair to pluck it. There are other Tweezerman products that are more effective but I didn't see them for sale on Amazon. Found one that works at Walgreens (purple coated).
