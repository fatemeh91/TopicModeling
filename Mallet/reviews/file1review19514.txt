review/text: we bought this topper to use when our daughter was 6months old. we were having her use the toilet to poop instead of her cloth diapers and the big potty was too big. i tried putting her on a small potty chair and she cried. so i bought this and it was the perfect combo. she could be up high and see us but it also gave her, and us, more security while she was up there. now that she's 16mos old, she still can't climb up alone to use it but can sit all by herself on it and it appears very comfy. it adjusts to any seat and there is no danger of it slipping off or into the toilet. once she can climb up to the seat by herself, it will be even better to have (i have vivid memories of being afraid of the "big" potty). i prefer when she uses this seat instead of her little potty chair because i have nothing to clean up afterwards! it's really well made - buy a step-stool to go along with it and you have a place to sit while helping your little one go!
