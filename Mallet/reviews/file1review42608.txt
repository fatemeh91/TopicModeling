review/text: I don't have a lot of experience with protein shakes but after a lot of research and discussion with Crossfit and mountain biking friends I decided on whey protein. Then I started comparing whey protein shakes by: caloric intake, price, taste reviews, and nutritional value. I went with this one and am not sorry. I got the chocolate fudge flavor and mixing it with water it taste pretty good. It's no milk shake, of course I haven't tried it with milk, but its good. It taste better and mixes WAY BETTER than other protein shakes I've tried. I've been mixing it in a GNC blender cup 1 - 2 times a day for about a week and have never had chunks or globs of mix at the end of my drink. I think I've finally ended my search with this product.
