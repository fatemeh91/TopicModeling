review/text: I ordered this product in June 2010, and was at first very pleased with it. However, about a month or a little more ago (Late September to early October 2010), the "pleasure pearls" stopped working. The vibration was still good, but it just wasn't the same without the rotating action. I expected this product to last longer than it did. Additionally, it did not handle natural "clenching" well, at such times the "pearls" would slow dramatically or even stop. Sometimes, when the batteries were low, it would also spontaneously turn itself off mid-use due to clenching. Also, I ordered the purple version, but received the clear version. Product was very wide and uncomfortable at first, I strongly suggest lube and going very slowly the first few times. Would I buy again? Probably not.
