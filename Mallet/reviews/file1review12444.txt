review/text: I began suffering with plantar fasciitis in both feet after running. My right foot healed on its own in a couple of weeks. My left foot pain has lingered for about 3 months now. To date I have tried exercises, ice, ibuprofen, massage, heat, rest, etc. I have spent money on a home ultrasound device (don't waste your money). I have bought about 6 different types of orthodics. The Dr. Scholl's custom fit did help some. I went to the New Balance Store and bought some good quality running shoes. This has also helped some, but the pain was not totally going away. Then I purchased this night splint. It does take getting use to, but once you get use to it, you will notice that your foot is starting to heel. I have been wearing the splint for a little over a week now and I have a lot of improvement. It is important to keep the plantar fascia tendon stretched while sleeping to promote healing. Without the splint your foot relaxes and the tendon contracts. I would also recommend that you check your arches. I had been buying orthodics with arch support because I assumed I had arch problems. The salesmen at the New Balance store said my arches were normal. I removed the arch supports and just bought good running shoes with cushion. They feel a lot better.
