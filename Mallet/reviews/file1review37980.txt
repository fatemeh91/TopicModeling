review/text: I work as an EHS engineer in a manufacturing setting. We have purchased some heartstart defibs for our facilities. AED are a wonderful device that has the opportunity to save FAR MORE lives than CPR alone.These devices have human studies that show an 89% success rate on first shock.Simply do some research to learn how important these devices are. For the individual that complained about not being to use it on yourself, that is just dumb. You don;t want to shock someone's heart if it is still working, the shock would kill them. That is why this device will only allow a shock to be given if the patient's heart has stopped (the machien does all the work). It is truly a lifesaver and $1500 is a great price compared to the $3000 price tag of 2 years ago.Others that review this device and do not like it must not actually know much about AED's, CPR, etc.
