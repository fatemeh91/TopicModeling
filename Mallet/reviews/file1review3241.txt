review/text: These are really great. I thought my old pairs were high end (Revlon) but I lost one so I did some quick reading on Amazon and decided on these to put in my purse. I picked this color since they would be easy to find. They are so easy to use (not that you need special skill or anything :0)). You can get to any single hair very easily and pull once...my other pair wasn't so easy. I surely recommend!
