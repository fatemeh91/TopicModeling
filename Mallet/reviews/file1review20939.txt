review/text: Do not order this product. I ordered this kit and it came two days ago. The kit had nothing in it!!!! It was just the blue container. Granted, the container is of good quality, but it was supposed to contain the homeopathic pellets. So, I requested a replacement. The package came in a timely manner. I, literally, JUST opened the replacement package. There is nothing in it!!! Just skip this product all together. The shipper obviously has a QC problem.
