review/text: I really like the color selection and the softness of this product, but I am very disappointed by the shrinkage. The cover barely fits over the pad (weren't they made to go together?) and the pad itself it turning up at the corners. When I lay my baby down on the pad, he is comfortable, but he sinks into the pad because it doesn't fit properly. It does look nice, though in our nursery, but if I could do it over I would have selected a different pad and cover.
