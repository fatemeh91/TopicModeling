review/text: We bought this watch for my wife's 100 year old aunt who is legally blind (sees only shades and shapes).It took a few tries for her to be able to consistently find the blue "demand" button, but once she found it a few times, she had it pretty good. A texture (e.g. raised bumps, cross, etc.) could have helped find it more easily. All in all a great watch for this purpose for a very reasonable price.
