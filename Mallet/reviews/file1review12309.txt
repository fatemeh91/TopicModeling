review/text: I really like this bar, the texture is not too sweet and icky like a lot of other brands which can have a nasty aftertaste. No sugar is awesome, most bars are loaded with sugar which seems like pure insanity to me.Just a note about carbs, one reviewer expressed concern that this bar had way more carbs than the next carb number. Net carbs are the carbs that count when doing Atkins & I think other low carb program. Fiber counts on nutrition panels as a carbohydrate but when dieting is a good thing, so you subtract it from the figures. Otherwise broccoli would even look like a high carb food! These, like most of the sweet food replacers also use sugar alcohols, which alter glucose levels very little but help with the sweet taste. I wouldn't eat this at every meal, but I really love them when I'm on the run and the only other options are bagels and muffins.
