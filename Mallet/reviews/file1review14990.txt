review/text: Love those vitamins.They may be a bit difficult to swallow and they have a weird smell, but they work for me.My hair stoped falling and my nails are starting to grow.The only side effect is the color of the urine,it's almost green, but it doesn't really matter to me.I will recommend these vitamins.
