review/text: I bought these batteries a while ago, but since I've bought some replacements, i realize just how crappy these duracell batteries are. Like another reviewer stated, they don't hold a charge. he said more that 2 weeks, when mine were freshly delivered, they didn't last more than 3 days in a wireless mighty mouse. A mouse. These Sony cycleEnergy ones and the other Sony's prior to it have been awesome. They work fine in rockband wireless devices, and I've been trying to drain them so I can to a recharge, but it's taking a while. It lost 8% charge in 2 weeks in my might mouse. I think I'll probably go back to them. I was wooed by the great looking ratings on the duracells, but if they don't keep the charge, the number don't matter. ps, these were made in japan, with a blue top visible.
