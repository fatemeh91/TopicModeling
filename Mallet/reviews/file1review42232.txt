review/text: I like this pill planner mainly for it's shape. It's small enough that I can just stick it in my purse. Unfortunately, it's kind of cheaply made. When you lift one of the tabs, it will only open up a little bit for you. You can't force it open any further because the tab will just break off, which is what happened to me. The plastic "hinge" of the tab is just a stiff piece of plastic. It is not very pliable. So you can either slip in your pills through the little opening you can get, or try to open it further and risk breaking the tab right off. I would have otherwise been happy with the product.
