review/text: The shaver quit working completely after 30 days. Prior to that the trimmer would not snap back in place and it was louder than the lawn mower! Had to send back to Wahl for repair or replacement. Very disappointing. The last Wahl shaver we purchased was in 1995 and lasted all these years.
