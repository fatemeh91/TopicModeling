review/text: got this for me and my boyfriend. I bought this cause i had a little extra money left over, and i thought it would be fun to buy. Flavors are good i like the strawberry. I threw away the banana and chocolate, and mint. Not because it was gross just cause i dont like those flavors at all in anything. I will be buying again. I would buy again.
