review/text: I have chronic plaque psoriasis that covers between 75 and 80% of my body at any given time. Like many Americans at this time, I'm out of work and recently became uninsured so I must turn to over the counter treatments.This product has not miraculously cured my psoriasis, but it has helped substantially. The thickest scale has peeled and is now only slightly raised. Overall, the appearance is much more manageable and a few small "start of an outbreak" spots have receded.One thing I will note is that it has to be reapplied a few times. The packaged directions say between one and four times a day. People who have less severe cases may be able to use it less frequently, but since I reapply it throughout the day I can definitely smell it all the time--slightly minty or sweet-smelling, definitely not bad, but noticeable.
