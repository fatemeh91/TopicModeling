review/text: I had some foot trouble and my foot doctor started me with a pair of these SPENCO Arch Supports, but he warned me that they were temporary. I found them on the Amazon.com website for less than half of what the doctor charged me and bought two pair. My feet are better now and I no longer need the arch supports. These saved my feet and saved me cash..!!!
