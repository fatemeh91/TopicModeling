review/text: This stuff is terrific for dry feet. It is expensive, but worth it, if your feet are dry and giving you trouble.Here is the reason it is not 5 starts: It is almost impossible to get out of the tube. Not sure what the correction might be -- a bigger opening, a little thinner mix -- I guess ultimately that is not my problem.Don't buy this if you don't have the muscle to get it out of the tube.
