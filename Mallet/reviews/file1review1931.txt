review/text: I had a bad fungus problem on my feet/toes and used this in combination with some other products to clear it up. Now I just use this to clean and maintain my feet and it seems to work well. It is very soothing on tired feet after a long day. It smells nice and has a strong smell of tea tree oil. The small bottle actually lasts a long time too when only used on my feet.
