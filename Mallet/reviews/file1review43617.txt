review/text: I received this monitor just 2 or 3 days after ordering it. The price was excellent, as I'd priced them in the local pharmacy and they were charging twice the price. It is very accurate and convenient to use since it operates with either batteries or an electrical plug. It also has the capability of storing readings for later comparision. It's quite easy to use and eliminates the need for a stethoscope because it is built right into the cuff. I'd recommend both the monitor and the seller.
