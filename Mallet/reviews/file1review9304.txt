review/text: If you take a lot of vitamins, this case works great ! I do not use the separate parts inside but rather put a lot of vitamins inside for one large dose. Stays closed and easily fits in a pants pocket. The days of the week and different colors are cute, if you take different vitamins on different days. It comes with a countertop holder that is good, if you want to store the week's vitamins in a neat way. Otherwise, save counter space and toss the week's cases into a plastic cup in a cabinet. A good deal for vitamin gurus.
