review/text: the emjoi AP 99 epilator seems to be probably the best one on the market. after reading the many other awesome reviews posted here, especially the person who said it worked well on thick body hair better than all the others; I decided this was the one! [ also this kind was recommended by one of the transgender people in an online support group network] and so, being a transgender male [girl's emotional spirit inside a physically male shell]who prefers that smooth, "feminine-like" feeling of having shaved legs, arms, and body; it definitely works even on the thickest hairs. it seems to miss a few spots sometimes, but overall it does work quite well. after a while, about a month or maybe 4 times, already the hairs seem to be growing in thinner and thinner, and in fewer places. and so it definitely works better than shaving and under the arms it does not even cause irritation at all and no irritation along the " bikini line" either.
