review/text: The digital calipers work just fine, the button selection/menu is a little bit clunky, but if you follow the instructions it works well enough.A lot of complaints are in regards to the accuracy, lack of repeatibility, etc.. I agree with the fact that the instructions are lacking in informing you about exactly where to take the measurements, but if you look up the subject on the internet you will find a few different conventions used in getting consistent readings. I recommend using [...] for getting better information on exact locations, and guidelines on where to do the measurements and how.Regardless of the difficulties people complained about with this unit, ALL body fat measurement products measuring bodyfat with calipers will not be consistent to a high degree of accuracy. The real issue is averaging of several values at each location, and consistency in your measurement technique. If you read Scooby's guidelines you should become pretty proficient at taking repeatable measurements. And if you get obvious outliers in your data just try again. I think the customers whining about the accuracy issues want it to plop onto their blubber and spit out a repeatable number every time. This type of bodyfat measurement is not a high-precision method, but it works almost as well as the higher end systems that require expensive testing and machines to calculate bodyfat.The goal for bodyfat measurement is in trends, not perfectly accurate measurements. Also, the measuring tape is pretty cool because it conforms somewhat to your body, and has spring tension to provide help in getting more reliable measurements.
