review/text: I take kelp as a supplement to provide iodine. I believe it helps protect from exposure to radiation, but don't quote me on that. I'm not a doctor and I didn't stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night.Carlson is a brand I trust and will pay a premium for. I like, or at least don't mind the taste of kelp, and Carlson brand kelp tastes good.
