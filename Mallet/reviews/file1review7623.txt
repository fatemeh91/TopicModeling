review/text: Castle Forbes has a reputation as one of the best wetshaving products ever, and it's well deserved.It may be expensive relative to other products, but this super thick cream goes a long, long way: approx 1 teaspoon and a nice badger brush will make enough dense lather to shave my whole head and face. Normally, I use much less than that for regular face shaves.The smell is very strong, and actually smells like real lavender, not fake-flowery garbage.Very slick feeling, and rinses away well too. If you want the best, spend the money. You won't regret it.
