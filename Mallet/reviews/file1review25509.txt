review/text: I was totally satasfied with this item. Simple, straight forward and easy to use. I didnt have any of the "pulling" problems other reviewers had either. Just a bit of a tickle while it was trimming.I used this about once a week, just to keep everyting under control, for about 4-5 weeks. Then it just stopped working, wont work no matter what I do. And yes, I did try new battereies.For the price this is a great item, if it would have lasted more than 4-5 uses. I think I will buy a nicer one next time and hope it lasts a little longer.
