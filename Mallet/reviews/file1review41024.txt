review/text: I tried this drink to last longer while partying. That was a mistake cause I pushed myself to the limit and stayed awake all night til early morning. The next day I was crashed out feeling like crap. I don't recommend that. But it takes your hunger away and keeps you awake. This drink is great to get you through the day if you have depression like me. I would sleep til late. Couldn't do anything so tired. This drink is great to keep you awake and full of energy. Just don't use it to stay up late and drink, tiny drinks from gas station are perfect for that. I am going to keep buyin to lose weight, it really keeps you full.
