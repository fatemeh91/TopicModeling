review/text: At the age of 68 I need all the help I can get to feel like doing the things I love to do. Source of life, does just that, its a natural way to help your body get all the things nature intended you to eat that food processing takes out. My husband and I have given up other things to be able to afford this product. We can feel the difference in our pep and feeling of well being when we take Source Of Life. We are definitely healthier. It is very rare if either of us catch a cold. Our resistance to picking up bugs out in public, on airplanes, and menus has made us much healthier. We will be life long users of this product.Cordially,Mrs Beads A Lot
