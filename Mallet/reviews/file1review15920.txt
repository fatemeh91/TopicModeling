review/text: I purchased this primarily to use on our vacation to Disney World. I was 31/32 weeks pregnant during our trip and couldn't walk much without quite a bit of discomfort. I LOVE this product and plan to use it through the remainder of my pregnancy. I only wear it when I'm being active. It's especially nice when I'm playing outside with my child and cleaning house.I don't have any issues with the velcro catching on clothing and it doesn't slide. I also wear full panel maternity shorts, so it hasn't irritated my skin since the majority of it is against my clothing. Be sure to read size information carefully...I nearly ordered a large and am glad I did not. You can tell that you're wearing something under your clothing, but this doesn't bother me at all. When I'm pregnant, it's all about comfort! I strongly recommend this item for the late second and (so far) third trimesters. I wish I had owned this with my first child!
