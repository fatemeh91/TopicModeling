review/text: Heavier weighted, large size, and moist heat make this heating pad unlike anything you would buy in a regular store. My mother is a spinal patient and has used these heating pads for years and they are the BEST!! They wrap around legs and other body parts easily and they heat up fast. The heat stops when you release the handle, so patients are less likely to burn themselves even thought this heating pad can hit high temps. Great product and I've never had a problem with the Thermaphore brand! I highly recommend this to anyone needing heat treatment for chronic pain issues, muscular issues, or sports injuries.
