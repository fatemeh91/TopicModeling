review/text: I'm a college kid - i usually like to have the nicer stuff (hah - talk about conflicts of finance there - college AND big spender - yeah - i work my tail off to afford both! lol)I got a lower end norelco 3 head shaver a year ago - and i liked it - but i saw some newer norelco's that had the moisturizer in them - so i told my mom to get that for christmas - well she wasn't sure exactly what i meant - so she just went out and got me the nicest shaver they sold at the store! This was TOTALLY unexpected - i was excited - but i was concerned - this one did not have 3 pivoting heads that i had used before - i wasn't sure how close i'd get of a shave.... WOW - leme tell ya - after i decided to use it christmas day - i gota say - i can not believe how smooth my face was - i didn't think that was possible without hot wax!The clean&charge; is very cool - and the smell is GREAT. Only complaint i have - is that its a little hard to find replacement clean&charge; cartridges locally - i've gone to several stores - and still nothing - i hope to find them at my local kmart - but i'm not sure.And as a side note - the fact that my face is so smooth - it is actually very appealing to the ladies when i give them a kiss. Very good quality unit here - definately worth the money
