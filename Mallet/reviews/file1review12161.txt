review/text: I took these vitamines just 3 times , but I started getting hives on my face and all over my body. I stopped taking vitamins but unfortunitaly the hives did not go away. It has been 5 days that I have not taken them but I still have hives on my face and body. They are itching very much. May be it is very rarely side effect, I don't know. But I know that right now I'm suffer from hives.Besides, in the nights of the days that I took the vitamins,I could not sleep well and when I slept I had nightmares. After I stopped taking them, nightmares ended.
