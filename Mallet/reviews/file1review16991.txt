review/text: This is the second one of these that I have bought. The first on gave long and excellent service and, no, it did not wear out--it got lost when my wife and I moved to new quarters. It does a great job. I do not, however, know how long it retains its power when not in use and not being charged so if that is important to you it might be best to read more reviews. For my use it is definitely rates five stars
