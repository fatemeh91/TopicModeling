review/text: While aesthetically pleasing, this razor was a letdown on all levels of possible utility. I bought the razor for my fiance's birthday, as he has long spoken of wanting to switch from disposables to a straight razor for the allure of A) fiscal and environmental practicality, and B) the machismo of Good Ol' Fashioned MAN skill. ;) However, the razor arrived DULL. So dull, the strop (which I also purchased) did nothing. So dull we had to go out and buy a sharpener. So very, extremely, incredibly dull, that after days and nights (MANY) of my fiance sitting down and sharpening for hours on end, until his fingers and hands would cramp, it still was far from usable on his (really not that stubborn) facial hair. While this may be the nature of the beast, perhaps it should have come with a warning that this razor is, as it comes, really more for show than use, and if it is to be used as intended (as a shaving device) what to expect: disappointment.
