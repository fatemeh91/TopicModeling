review/text: Satisfying, healthy, convenient, not too sweet, nice chewy consistency, great flavor, good portion size, no high-fructose corn syrup or unnatural fats, WHOLE soybeans, real dried fruit, 4gm protein, won't melt - what is not to like? I've tried a lot of protein/snack bars. These are the best and have the most balanced nutrition. They are a perfect snack, at work or to keep in the car. All the flavors are wonderful. Check out their website for more info at soyjoy.com. Kudos to Amazon for selling them in bulk.
