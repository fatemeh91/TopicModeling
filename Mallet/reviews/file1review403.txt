review/text: I have bought many toys over the past 6 years for my wife. I started out with a pretty large vibrator that had some really weird fins on it. She really hated it. So i have relaxed on my purchasing of these types of toys. After a while we found one that really works. A small vibrator. Then last year I found a girth increase toy that fit on me. The wife really liked it and started to use it more and more. i figured if I stay away from weird looking vibrators she would like them. So last week after much looking and reading reviews I picked this up from Amazon. After alot of foreplay and much lube / bondage she opened up to it. I did blind fold her so she did not see it. She even told me after the fact that if she had seen it before she would have said no. It was pretty big but she liked it after the initial thrust. It was completely different then any thing else we have tried. which means it did different things to her body that was unique. I had to back it off a number of times to make it last. worked great to use while performing oral on her as well.ProsPower wise - GREAT. I would have liked to see 2 C batteries - there is enough room in it. The turning worked great at any speed. The vibration hit the sweet spot first time on. I kept the vibration at the minimal setting. Which was perfect for my lady. If you like more it has it.CONSI am not sure I would trust it in the water. Long enough to wash it but not in a bath tub for extended amount of time.Not a Con or ProAlso the changing of the direction of the ball bearings did not affect her the way I thought it would but it did give a very brief stopping point.I am looking forward to a long career with this toy. adding it to my arsenal of tools to use to make my wife a happy wife!
