review/text: I love this stuff! Don't know how I will ever shave without it! The smell is great and lasts through the day, but is not overpowering like many colones. The best part is it leaves my skin feeling refreshed and reduces the chance of ingrown hairs. It is also great at soothing razor burn if you end up using your razor past the recommended amount of time.
