review/text: I have used this product for a year now. If you like lavender, the smell is great. If you prefer unscented, the company also makes that. The price offered on Amazon is quite competitive -- so I'm going to order it from them from now on. I like the fact that the NOW Foods brand has no parabens of any kind in it. I also tried the one offered online (from [...]) but it is 5 times as expensive; plus my breasts hurt when I used it. And finally, my credit card got compromised because of some breach in security with the server that the womhoo company used. Therefore, I switched back to the NOW Foods brand and am happy with it. I consider it a kind of "candy" for my body. And I trust the Amazon.com credit card security measures. I've never had a problem with them.
