review/text: I bought this razor simply because I was tired of paying high dollar for the cartridge blades. This one takes the standard DE blade. The razor has a short handle, which is ok for me, but for some guys with larger mitts they would need the long handled razor.The razor has a good solid feel and is well balanced, which is important when you are going to cut yourself, if it wasn't.It may take a few tries to keep you from cutting yourself. Luckily, there is help out there. From books, to youtube videos and shaving blogs, help is at your fingertips.This razor is a nice addition to my morning routine.I look forward to using this quality razor for years to come.
