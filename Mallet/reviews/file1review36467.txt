review/text: Thank you so much for creating the Adaptalap! I have a 3-year old daughter who is visually impaired. With the Adaptalap she can look at books, draw, use a magnet board and a felt board, look in a mirror, and I'm sure do many things we haven't discovered yet, all without the terrible neck and back strain she used to experience when bending low over a table or her lap. It's simple to use and efficient, and it works from the floor, at a chair and table, in bed, and in the car. I am so thankful that Julie Smith. our vision therapist, told us about your product. Thank you again.
