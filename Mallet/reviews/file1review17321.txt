review/text: The good: quick, easy to use and adjust, virtually no maintenance required, and pretty good trimThe bad: in less than a year, I am purchasing my second because the batteries have crapped out. It literally doesn't hold charge for longer than one 2min shave now. But I guess the evidence that despite this I'm buying my second is pretty good support for the product, overall.
