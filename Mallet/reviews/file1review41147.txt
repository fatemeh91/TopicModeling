review/text: As always, terrific service. The product does a good job but you can still get nicked if you are not careful, as with any trimmer. We have the T-shaped for certain areas and this one for places the other trimmer doesn't do such a good job. All these trimmers are overpriced, but they are imported, so the materials are of good quality and they last a long time, if you don't drop them.
