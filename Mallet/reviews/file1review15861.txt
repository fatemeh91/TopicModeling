review/text: It's my own fault for not reading the description carefully enough, but I was expecting hand-dipped sticks, not factory made. Probably 20% of these sticks go out before they burn fully and the Dragonsblood just doesn't smell as good as the sticks you buy from individuals who craft their own. I will use them when I run out of my preferred stock in a pinch, but I won't buy any more.
