review/text: 5 out of 5 because this stuff lives up to its name. I love the thermogenic effects and endurance it gives me in the gym and within 1wk. of 2pks/day I was noticing lines in my abs and shoulders that weren't there before. This is a great supplement if you're looking stay lean. I am ordering my second can which will arrive during my 1 wk. break they recommend between cycles. I've never used this sort of supplement before but have no desire to look to another product.
