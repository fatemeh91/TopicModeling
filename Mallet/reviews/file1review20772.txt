review/text: I bought this shaver over a year ago from Amazon. It was the most expensive shaver I've ever purchased so I was a little worried about whether or not it would be a good buy. I was immediately happy with the shaver. It takes a few days for your face to get used to any new shaver, and this was no different. After the initial "getting to know you" phase, I had great shaves every morning. This has been hard for me in the past because I have thick facial hair and electric shavers tend to have a problem with that. Not this one. Every morning when I pick it up to use it, I feel like I'm using a new shaver. It smells great and cuts great every single time. I wanted to wait a year before I reviewed the product because I wanted to make sure I was still loving it, and I am. The only downside is that you have to buy those replacement cleaning cartridges. I have gone through probably 5 or 6 refills this last year. I use the cleaning feature every morning, and when I leave town for a week I don't cover the cartridge back up (which I read that you can do). I figured it wasn't worth the hassle. I am just today purchasing my first foil/blade refill and that is around $30, and I would guess I've spent about $25 on cleaning refills. So, in a year, I've spent about $55 on maintenance of the thing. I feel like this is worth it considering the quality of the shave and the durability of the product. If you've used electric shavers as long as I have you know that after about a year the battery wears down, there are parts of the shaver that you can't get clean, and the cutting power is decreased. I have not noticed any of those issues after year one with this shaver. I strongly recommend it!
