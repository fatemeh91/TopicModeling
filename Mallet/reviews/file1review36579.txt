review/text: This works well for its designed purpose. I found the set of different-sized trimming heads to be good, though the most useful is the one that looks like a very aggressive toothbrush. The shaver can only handle relaly short hairs as left behind by the trimming heads, so you end up having to use both. It doesn't catch skin in the trimmer blades unless you're exceptionally hamfisted, unlike some other hair trimmers where it is common. It deals pretty well with long hair, though not so well with curly hair since it trims to an absolute height above the skin - it can take several tries to deal with them.
