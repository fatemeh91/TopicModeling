review/text: The only reason I couldn't give this item five stars is that it does take some getting used to, especially if you like to sleep on your side. Because the mask is made to not put pressure on your eyes, it does have pretty thick padding around the eye areas, so when you lie on your side, the pillow pushes the mask over. It only took me a couple of nights to get used to it, though.I love that I can open my eyes inside the mask! I used to always wake up with blurry vision due to my old mask pressing against my eyes all night, and it was also damaging my eyelashes. This mask does not make contact with the eyes or lashes at all!If you have a larger than normal head, the adjustable strap on this may not fit you. It's not elastic, but it is adjustable with velcro. However, it doesn't get very big. You could probably rig it to work if you're inventive.When fitted properly, NO light gets through this mask, not even at the bridge of the nose. It's totally worth the few nights of getting used to the feel.
