review/text: I felt like I had to review this product since I saw the one other reviewer stating that it did nothing for her and my experience was completely different.If you have a curiosity about 5 HTP and are thinking over purchasing MRM's I would certainly recommend it! I have tried 2 others now and think this is the best in capsule form. I tried Natrol brand from Costco and did *not* think much of it.My husband and I picked up the MRM brand at the local supplement store sort of on a whim. We had also read the Mood Cure (also highly recommended) recently and I knew I had to do something about my mood having been in a deep depression for nearly 3 years.We followed instructions and took it on an empty stomach (it's an amino acid and protein inhibits its absorption). I think in the evening is preferable; we took it before dinner. Slowly but *surely* a lovely feeling of a glowing, warmth and calm joy radiated through our beings... (approximately 20 mins later, lasting maybe 3 or 4 hours?). My husband and I kept on checking in on each other's mood and sensations. They were great! I thought this is what I *should* feel like on a regular basis. We live in the PNW and with the rainy gray days it is a challenge. Doubly so if your thyroid may not be working properly (but I digress). We have added this to our daily supplements and I while I am a work in progress I would say I am getting happier all the time.A nice side benefit is a decrease in appetite, notably sweets and carbs and enjoyable dream recall.I appreciate 5 HTP so much I now buy it in powder form found here on Amazon.
