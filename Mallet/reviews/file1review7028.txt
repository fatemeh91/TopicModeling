review/text: I had intended to buy one of the Remingtons until I researched these consumer evals, which were jammed with horror stories about them. One man suggested Wahl, which I had never heard of, and when he mentioned that it was the last American manufactured razor, that sealed the deal. It came with 3 differently gauged foils. The charging base was unassembled for some reason, which I quickly remedied with some model glue. The cleaning brush is utterly worthless; the fact that I use an old toothbrush says it all.I have exceptionally bad luck with merchants, so of course, mine was the one that slipped through quality control and arrived with a misaligned grip. This did not affect its performance, which is first rate, and I suppose most men could just grin and bear it, but I returned it for replacement as my relationship with merchants is essentially a state of war. In summary, well worth the low price, in my opinion.
