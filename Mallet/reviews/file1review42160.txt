review/text: I bought 12 of these diapers when I decided to start using cloth diapers on my 16 month old. We have been using them for a week. I really love these diapers. We have had a couple of leaks, but it has been mostly trial and error on my part.My tips about leaks:-Make sure the diaper is 100% dry before you use it! They do take a lot of drying time - more than 40 minutes on high in the dryer.-If you snap the doubler in the front, make sure it does not go to close to the waist of the diaper. This happened today and his urine went right out. Don't know why the doubler was so high up. Maybe it was for a prints and I used it in a solids. I usually use them in the back anyway.-When you put the diaper on a wiggly baby, make sure the sewn in soaker is smoothed and in proper position.Other notes:-I use flushable liners since my son is on table food and is teething. For new moms, this means poo that is not solid... However, the couple of times I skipped the liner and had to clean up the diaper, a bit of toilet paper and a good rinse in the sink took care of it. Or get a diaper sprayer...-The diapers have come out looking like new after every wash. I've only done a few washes, but so far, no stains or smell.Drawbacks:I personally think these will be very bulky for a newborn. But I haven't tried it either. And of course, it would depend on how big your newborn is.If your baby has chunky thighs you will have to play with the snap settings a bit to keep him/her from getting red elastic marks on his thighs. I hear that Happy Heiny's don't have elastic leg casings and won't leave marks. Haven't tried them yet as they are sized diapers, but it's something to consider.
