review/text: you may ask how i know this? well, after discovering that my son had two crayons in his pocket AFTER i washed and dried said clothing, i discovered RED AND YELLOW CRAYON ALL UP IN MY BRAND NEW FREAKING DRYER. hmph. kids. lets not even go into how the clothing appeared. i knew better than to use this product on those items being the smart gal i am (sarcasm. what mom doesn't check a 5 year olds pockets???). however, i started using it inside the new dryer and was very, very pleased. and then in my haze of lysol smells, i finally read the huge warnings on my dryer that say "DO NOT USE FLAMMABLE PRODUCTS OR PRODUCTS THAT CONTAIN OILS" other than cooking oils, mind you.). after clearing my head with fresh air in the laundry room, i call their handy dandy number. after a short wait, i speak to james who does indeed tell me this product has a zero flammability rating (YAY!) and indeed does not contain any oils. A+ customer service i tell ya. and while i waited, the message that played offered me a great green bean casserole recipe! however, having half my body in a dryer prevented me from taking them up on this tempting, tempting offer. i had bigger fish to fry.i do believe i bought this product on sale no less for a measly $1.97 and has saved my $1000 dryer. quite a deal, eh? now i do find that red crayon gets removed easier than yellow. i'll have to save that review for crayola. so my dryer looks a bit jaundiced as i may look after i drink a bottle of vodka to eliminate the horror of this morning. and perhaps the whole family will reek of lysol, but better than the alternative. keep in mind, when you have kids, don't buy ANYTHING NEW. except a fresh bottle of lysol 4 in 1 cleaner.score:kids: 1,588,632me: 0
