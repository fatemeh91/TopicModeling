review/text: This really is a miracle cream for dry, cracked feet. I'm surprised this isn't more well known or advertised. I don't have to use it every day, but at first just apply it, put a sock on and wear it all day, no need to do it at night, unless you are comfortable wearing socks. In 3 days the cracks were gone and the skin on my heels was soft. I only wish the seller didn't take 3 months to ship it to me. I'll have to find another supplier in future. The 2nd half of my order finally arrived on May 21, 2012.
