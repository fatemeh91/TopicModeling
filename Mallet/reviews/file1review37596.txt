review/text: I think this is a very good product. The fragrance is pleasant, not overbearing. It glides on very nicely. It seems like a little will go a long way -- meaning, the product doesn't seem to wear down a lot. The number one reason everyone should like this product is that you stay dry and odor free and best of all, there's no white residue on your clothes. When this Degree is used up, I'll order another!
