review/text: I first found this item at my local Walgreen's. It is wonderful to tuck these away in your purse, pocket, suitcase or desk drawer. The packaging saves space. Very hygenic. Obviously Dr. Ken has thought this product out well. If you want to be able to floss while not at home, buy this, you won't regret it.
