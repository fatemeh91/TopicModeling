review/text: After having a knee replaced I needed handrails for the shower. Permanent ones were not an answer so I looked at suction cup ones. I found several priced over a hundred dollars. when I saw these i ordered two.I applied them to the shower and then tried to pull them off I could not. I am very pleased with them
