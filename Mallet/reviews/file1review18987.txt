review/text: These tests worked just as well as the more expensive store bought tests. The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because, I wouldn't give the name brand tests 5 stars either. Too hard to tell if a very visable yet slightly lighter test line means +. According to a digital test that I took simultaneously, it does, yet the directions state the line must be the same color or darker. But now that I know this, I think the tests are very good for the $.
