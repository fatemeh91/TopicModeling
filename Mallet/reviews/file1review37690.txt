review/text: I am now a Mitchum man! If you are looking for a review to know whether you should get this or not, this is the one. I love the simple design of the deodorant case and the actual deodorant smelled so wonderful! If your considering this product, you have to consider Mitchum. I've tried over 20 different brands and this was an obvious best for me. After hours of heavy lifting and chores, the deodorant did not show any signs of bad odor. Not only that but my armpits were so dry in situations where I was hot and sweating. This is absolutely amazing and the scent- loved it!
