review/text: Lots of artificial flavors--the fruit, the fake sugar--overall, just...yuck. The kids and adults are having a hard time getting these down. Maybe if you're used to flintstones or other commercial vitamins, these would be okay. We were taking naturally-flavored Solaray previously, and these are truly wretched by comparison. I was lured in by price. Not again.Vitamin-wise, I guess these are okay, but light on mineral content. Also note that these do not have iron.
