review/text: I bought thid product because it was the only one that said the heat on it. It does get very hot which is nice and the jets are also very nice. nothing bad to say about it yet, we haven't tried to use salts or oils yet but are not worried about it. The cord is nice and long and the heater will heat up the water surprisingly fast.
