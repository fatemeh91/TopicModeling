review/text: I got this item at the recommendation of my doctor for a back/hip area that was aggravated and causing discomfort while walking during pregnancy. Four days in this and everything has gone back to its original comfortable position. I haven't had to wear it constantly, but when the hip/back area starts to get aggravated I just put this on for about 4 days and the pain goes away.
