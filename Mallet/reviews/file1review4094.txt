review/text: It's torture to have to force myself to pay so much for these blades, which results in a lot of price comparing. For some reason Amazon had these Power Blades cheaper than the regular Fusion blades,(they look identical to me), plus they had free shipping and no tax. Much cheaper than any place in town.
