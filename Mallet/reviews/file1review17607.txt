review/text: The rechargeable battery on this has pretty much died in just over a year. After that I got only one or two trims on a full charge! The genius who designed it didn't even ensure that it will work when it is plugged in. After a couple of trims when it loses charge I need to plug it in overnight so I can use it again for the next couple of times. What a waste!I am back again shopping for a trimmer.
