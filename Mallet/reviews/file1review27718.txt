review/text: I've used this product for over 6 months now but this is my first time buying a 10lb bag. The 3 star rating is there because of amazon's slow shipping. It said "shipping soon" for 5 days now and so I'm pretty sure T'm going to get this item in a week. This is a big step back as opposed to my previous experience with amazon, which my product came in a total of 3 days.
