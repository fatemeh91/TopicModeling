review/text: This is a great product and my oral hygenist has remarked on how healthy my gums are. I've been using the hummingbird (the flossers, not the picks) for two years now and I was dismayed to discover that it has been discontinued in Australia. I'm now buying the flosser refills from America. I sincerely hope the bird isn't given the bird there too.
