review/text: I travel a lot and many cities have restrictive smoking laws.Smoking outside is bad enough and I hate to throw the cigarette butt in the street so this is perfect. It is small, works well by just pulling and using the capsule-like device. It has a big enough inner surface (I think it is aluminum and sturdy enough. Once done smoking just crush the cigarette out and the butt goes down to the chamber. This is a very useful and handy product.
