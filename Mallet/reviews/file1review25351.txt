review/text: While it would be very helpful to be able to measure body fat percent daily, the methodology of this machine does not work for those taking diuretics. (Diuretic-taking people are thse high blood pressure who have to be very careful about their weight and body fat.)Tanita (the maker) notes that taking a diuretic will skew results, but their descriptions are unclear as to in which direction. The only advice to diuretic-takers in all of Tanita's provided liturature and on its website are to always "take measurements under the same conditions."Tanita provides no information as to the reference scales defining "healthy," "overfat," and "obese" for someone taking a diuretic. Are these ranges higher or lower for someone on a diuretic than for the "standard person"? By how much?No answer.Under these conditions, this scale is useless.
