review/text: This is better than the price would indicate, but it certainly isn't an expensive, high-quality loupe. It IS an exceptional value though. For the average to above average user, I think this would work well. I use mine to view slides and negatives on a light table and it functions very well. It magnifies well enough for me to discern the differences between same subject shots in color negatives.(As a bonus, my 2nd grader LOVED looking at an inchworm under it too! The clear area under the eyepiece/magnifier allows light through which helped with my son's excitement over science and living things...AND, it was cheap enough, that I wasn't worried about him ruining it.)You get what you pay for usually...but, in my opinion, you're getting more quality than the price usually allows. To put it in car terms...you're getting a Camry for a Corolla price. You definitely are not getting the Avalon-for-Corolla-money deal of a lifetime with this purchase...if that is your aim, you'll be disappointed.
