review/text: When I lost a fingernail, I got tired of banging the finger against stuff. These work well, stay on, are high quality, and there's enough here to last a while. (At the store it's hard to find a box with just fingertip bandages or with more than 10 to a box. Considering it's going to take a couple months for the nail to grow back out, 10 at a time just doesn't cut it.)
