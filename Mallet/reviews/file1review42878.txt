review/text: I bought this for my girlfriend but she never really wears it on her keys like its meant to, it would be a little obvious if someone were to actually see it on her keys. We have had our share of fun with this toy. It is loud and has a pretty strong vibration, but fun to use. Downside is that there really isn't much control over the speed. And unless you're having fun with it at a park or empty feild in the middle of the night, it will probably be heard as it's pretty loud, unless you have your own place, which then you might just want to invest in something a little better. But, it's conveniently small and easily fits insde small pockets. Great for those occasions were you can't bring an actual full size vibrator or need a little more concealment. Also great for those longer trips in the car!
