review/text: They work just like they say... throw one (or two for larger loads) into the machine with your clothes and start your washer. That's all there is to it and it works well at cleaning and does leave a slight fresh scent. Nothing overpowering. You will need to use a fabric softener as of yet they do not make a formulation including softener... or I have not found it yet. I can highly recommend this product! It's especially helpful to someone like myself who is disabled and cannot lug a heavy bottle or box of detergent... they are easy on the back because they weigh next to nothing. Order with confidence from Amazon and do your part to help save the planet as well... they have so many attributes that make them earth friendly... to name a few... much less packaging, lower shipping cost because of the lower weight, biodegradeable, etc. I do recommend you give them a try. Also, please note there is a formulation available in "Subscribe & Save" but I just wanted the one for now.
