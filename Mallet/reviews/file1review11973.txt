review/text: All my life my parents made me take one supplement or another and none of them ever made me feel any different. I had these recommended to me for my third pregnancy and I reluctantly ordered them, conceding that I needed a multivitamin to help insure a safe and healthy pregnancy. I was shocked and excited to find that, not only did they NOT make me sick or constipated, they actually made me feel more vibrant, healthy, energetic and even calm. I am continuing to take them while I'm breastfeeding and can't say enough good things about them. You won't be disappointed!
