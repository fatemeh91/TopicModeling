review/text: These pads are made of gauze woven of very fine threads which are spaced slightly more than 1mm apart, which leaves 1mm square holes throughout the gauze sheet. When folded on itself in 9 plies, you can still see through the gauze. 12 plies gives more of a visual barrior, but not much of a moisture one. I used a syringe to measure one-tenth of a cc of water. I placed a 2-ply paper towel, folded in half, on a table, put a 2-ply facial tissue on one half of the folded towel and one of the 12-ply gauze pads on the other half of the towel. I dropped the measured water first on the tissue and then the same amount on the gauze pad. The tissue did a better job of absorbing the water. It just dampened the top fold of the towel. The gauze pad held so little water that the fluid soaked through both folds of the towel and left a really wet spot even on the bottom fold of the towel. Any wound that requires a gauze pad will not be helped by these.IN ADDITION, THEY ARE MADE IN CHINA. After recent problems reported in the news, I have to wonder whether they are actually sterile. Do yourself a favor and skip these. You'd probably have to use at least three of them to get the absorbancy of the ones you can buy off the shelf at a discount pharmacy. Also the gauze is harsh feeling, not soft and comforting. It will cost as much to pack and ship back as I paid for them, so I guess I will toss them or use them to dust the crevices on my computer keyboard or grab several to wipe off my smaller artist paint brushes. Should also work well if you need to make a lot of bridal veils for a bunch of fashion dolls.
