review/text: I've used Kool 'n Fit for quite a few years for chronic neck (very degenerated disc) pain and constant shoulder & rotater cuff pain, and I must tell you that it's truly the only thing that's actually taken away, removed pain, albeit temporarily. But sometimes when I'm in shoulder spasm, the hour or two that Kool 'n Fit is working gives my muscles time to relax enough that when the pain returns, it's not as painful as before. I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone with chronic pain! Works better than ThermaCare and that type of thing, Tiger Balm, many other lotions and sprays I've tried. It's awesome! Try it, you'll find relief!
