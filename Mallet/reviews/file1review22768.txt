review/text: Overall Great product! I've tried several thermogenics and this is by far the best. I don't feel jittery, no anxiety, no stomachs aches, not too much "rush". It suppresses my appetite extremely well! It allows me to eat whenever I'm ready. You will get the urge to urinate quite often if you don't exclude the blue pills (but that's what diuretics do). The package gives you the choice to exclude certain pills if you want, which is another plus.If you're looking to cut, I would definitely recommend these! But don't forget - YOU CAN'T SOLELY RELY ON THE PILLS! You'll just lose water-weight.. make sure your getting proper nutrition, rest, and exercise. THEN enjoy a mouthful of pills.
