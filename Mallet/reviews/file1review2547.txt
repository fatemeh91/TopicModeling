review/text: The epilator did what I bought it for. It removed hair, and is painless (I am a long time epilator user, though). It is so painless, I used to do only below knees but ventured to do thighs and arms, and it worked fine. Even the tough ones came off after a few passes. My first epilator was Epilady, which was fine. It died after 3-4 years, and I bought Emjoi's ForeverFree spending over $100, but it didn't work at all. I was so discouraged and didn't want to waste any more money, so fixed my old Epilady myself and used it for another 10 years or so. It finally got to the point that it is not effective in removing hair, so I bought this one. This is worth the money spent. The only thing, which is very minor, is that the motor seems to be a bit too loud, and the head comes off too easily. I can't remember what I did to make the head come off when I didn't mean it to, but it didn't come off while removing hair, so I think it's ok.
