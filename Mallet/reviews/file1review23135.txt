review/text: This is a small carpet sweeper. I should have looked more closely at the dimensions. It works fine just takes forever to go over an area to clean....back and forth over and over to get the job done. Assembly is easy, BUT, the handle sections don't stay together and I had to tape them. Storage is interesting because the handle doesn't "lock" in an upright position so when the closet door is opened out comes the handle. If there was a hole on the top of the handle it could be hung on a hook because it weighs next to nothing but then if the handle wasn't taped together it would fall apart. Not a good value for the price.
