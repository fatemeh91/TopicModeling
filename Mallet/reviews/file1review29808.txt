review/text: I was looking for something to help my one year old breathe better at night and I didn't want to keep refilling a humidifier. This was the perfect thing for him. It helps to clear his stuffy nose pretty well. I only gave it four stars because I wish it would last longer. He sleeps about 10-12 hours a night and the scent pads stop working before that. Otherwise, it is a great product. I've been using it with the universal refill oil and pads every night for about a month, and it still works!
