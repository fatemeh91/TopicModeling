review/text: I normally love this product but not this one and I'll explain why.Shipping was great I do applaud that but this product is sooooo OLD on the back it has the year it was made and when ever I buy this product in a reatail-store it's usually 2008 or 2009 but the one I was sent had 1999 on the back CAN YOU BELIVE! and the normal looking texture for this lotion is very white and creamy and smells okay but the one I was sent by this company was YELLOW & WATERY and smelled bad...This lotion works great for dissapearing strechted skin when its not older than my brothers! I messaged them about wanting a new one because the one I received was old and they told me no they wouldn't send me another with out paying for it, BUT they did say they would refund me if I sended it back but I doubt they would actually would and didn't want to take that hassel for just 20 bucks.. I WILL NEVER BUY THIS LOTION ONLINE ONLY IN STORE WHERE I CAN SEE YEAR IT WAS MADE
