review/text: Hi,I have been experiencing GERD disease since few months. It does not matter whether or not I eat certain food types, I just have a "severe' acid reflux/heartburn none stop. To be honest, living like this SUCKS. I tried DGL, Mastic Gum for more than a month; unfortunately those did not work for me. I searched many natural products ( since I REALLY don't want to take any Proton/Prilosec products) and came across with Heartburn Free product. When I first took it last week ( every other day), I thought it was a MIRACLE that God sent. I truly thought this was it. I felt great. I told everyone that I felt GREAT. Well, I guess I spoke too soon! Since two days my hearburn/acid reflux attacks have come back and I had to use Prilosec. One of the reviewers/users mentioned as a TIP that continue using acid reducer pills. I think she might be right. Since two days I thought this product has not been working for me. I am going to use it to the end and pray that this product is my "natural" remedy. Stay tuned. I will write about it again. Good luck to everyone.
