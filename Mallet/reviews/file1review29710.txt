review/text: Well I have tried 4 brands of washable nursing pads in the first two months of motherhood and they are:Gerber - one star - pros: cheap, thin, made of a few layers of regular tightly knit cotton against the skin with a waffle like poly/cotton outer layer that faces your bra - cons: the pad diameter is too small to provide adequate leak coverage no matter how you position it around your nipple and material does not hold ANY amount of fluid - don't waste your money!Bravado - three stars and a half - pros: diameter is larger and more contoured without inner seam, adequately absorbant for medium leakage if positioned correctly over the nipple, despite its thickness doesn't show as much under clothing, made with cool max inner layer and dual layer of terrycloth that faces your bra, cons: does not provide even coverage as the inner coolmax layers are thicker on one half of the pad so as to make it more contoured without using an inside seam, still leaks fluid during letdown if heavy leaker, terry layers may come apart a little with machine washing, when soaking wet the coolmax inner layer makes you feel more cold & damp than a cotton layer doesAdvent - four stars - pros: provides even coverage, not too lumpy as does not have an inner seam, adequately absorbant for medium leakage, does not slip, retains its shape well with washings, made of tightly woven layers of flannel cotton against the skin with spongy absorbant material inside and a poly lace outer layer that faces your bra - cons: bulkier than disposables, diameter sufficient for some (up to size B/borderline C) but probably not for larger breasted, might look funny under shirts with some bras as not designed to be highly contoured, still leaks fluid during letdown if heavy leakerAmeda - four stars and a half - pros: provides even coverage, diameter is larger and more contoured toward the breast so does not slip and provides maximum leak protection for heavy leakers, made of tightly woven layers of flannel cotton throughout designed to be coned shaped with a seam that runs from the center to the outside of the pad, however seam is not visible under clothing - cons: a little lumpy looking under clothing for those that are not C/D breasted - best of the bunch I've tried so far though as far as coverage and leakage are concerned while still being a reuseable
