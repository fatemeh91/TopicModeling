review/text: This product works exactly as advertised, and I'm very happy with it. The ends of the tweezers are very sharp, making them perfect for extracting ingrown hairs or splinters without scarring. Like all sharp implements, you should protect the pointed ends (with the included cover) when not using in order to preserve sharpness.
