review/text: Ive been using GABA calm for about a year and just switched to this powder because it contained more of the GABA. My 10 y.o. son has asd and we were treating his anxiety and nervous energy with these supplements. Unfortunately, he has now had the worst school year ever with unpredictable behaviors, agression and the like. Staff was asking us if we tried putting him on meds. As an evperiment, we took him off all forms of GABA and what do you know- He has now had the best two weeks of his life. Im not saying this product will not work, just that if you are using it on children be aware it may have the opposite effect.
