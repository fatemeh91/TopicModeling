review/text: I purchased this a few days ago after my herbalist told me it would help with my reoccurring gum infections. It cleared the current infection right up, so I'm definitely going to keep using it. My only complaint is the strong taste of cloves that lasts for hours. I hate cloves. Other than that, it's great. I found it a little strong (it made my eyes water. lol) so I water it down a little.
