review/text: I bought this 12-pack of peanut butter Balance bars and noticed some white stuff on the bars when I opened them before eating. I shaved them off with a knife. Then I went to look for Cliff bars at Amazon and noticed a bunch of reviews complaining about white stuff or staleness in the bars they ordered. Bottomline: Buy books, buy music, buy anything but food from Amazon! Esp if they're on sale -- imagine how old it must be!
