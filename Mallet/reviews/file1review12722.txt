review/text: These bags can be used at home to package sandwiches.They can also be used for restaurant use.They can be used for preweighed meats and vegetables .So when it is time to cook ,just take the food out of the bag and start cooking . If these bags are used for meats and vegetables they can hold about 8-9 ounces each.They can also be stored in freezers with either meats or vegetables.If stored in freezers with meats and/or vegetables a good idea is then place about 10 bags in a larger plastic bag,then store them in freezer.These bags are not completely airtight.If you are looking for a more airtight bag you need the Glad Zipper Sandwich Bags. Glad Open Mouth Sandwich Bags are much more sturdier then other brands.
