review/text: I have cats. I've always had cats. I've always used lint rollers. Our usual roller, something we usually buy at Target, ran out. In a pinch I bought these at CVS, 'cause they were on sale. BOY, do they suck. You pick up more cat hair wrapping a piece of tape around your finger. They're the lousiest investment I've ever made and I will never, ever buy them again.
