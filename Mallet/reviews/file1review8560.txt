review/text: I would love to let people know what I thought of this product, but I can't because I never received it. After waiting for almost 2 weeks I still didn't have my package. I attempted emailing the company Women's Wellness, but they never responded. Luckily, Amazon took care of the situation and credited my money back. Women's Wellness shouldn't be selling through Amazon.
