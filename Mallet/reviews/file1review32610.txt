review/text: I purchased this particular brand of hibiscus tea because it was cheap -- but also quite effective. This tea is great for heart health, which is why I bought it in the first place. It took me a little while to like the taste because it's definitely very different from anything I've ever had before -- tangy and slightly sweet... However, now I actually crave it. ESPECIALLY with a teaspoon of honey. YUM! It also has a beautiful red color to it. It's just a great tea. I'm going to go make some right now! ~~~
