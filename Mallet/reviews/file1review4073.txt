review/text: I see that by the time I'm writing this review, the price has gone up.The order was a steal in terms of value, but I see other reviews claiming they are not the real deal.I often felt that something was a bit "off", but was never sure. (still not sure.)Would be 5 stars if I was sure if its authenticity, but until then 4 will suffice!
