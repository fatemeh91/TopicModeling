review/text: Consitantly, everytime I use my Triump, I say to my self "self, this is the cleanest your mouth has ever been without the pain torture of being at a dentist".My dentist was pushing this system on me for years. I never had intention of buying a tooth brush that was in the 3 digits. However after a sobering visit to the dentist where I was shown some signs of gum disease and new cavities, well I said "what the heck", let's buy this overpriced toothbrush.So as of last visit with using the Triumph for 3 months my destist reports that my gums are improving. My wife says that my teeth look cleaner and whiter than before.I know I love the pros and cons, so I will provide you with some:PROs* Idiot proof teeth brushing (uses a timer to help you know when you move to the next section of the month)* Fights gum disease* Cleans your teeth almost as good as the dentist, without the pain of the dentistCONSs* Relativly expensive to inferior electric tooth brushes and disposible ones* You can't cheat and only brush for what "you feel is enough time".* You could reduce the income of your favorite denstist since you might have less cavities and no gum diseaseHappy brushing!
