review/text: I own a store, and I have a typical commercial, heavy-duty carpet. People are constantly dragging in leaves and dirt, and during cottonwood bloom season, the seeds just keep appearing. I can't pull out the vacuum cleaner while customers are coming and going, but sometimes I just need to sweep the carpet, and this does the trick.While assembling it, I made sure to really jam the handle together. Nothing but the tension of the jamming together of the handle keeps the middle of the handle together. The bottom screws into the frame, but unscrews easily, too. I can see why some people are reporting problems with the handle.For me, the rubber bumper has fallen off so many times that I haven't bothered to put it back on. I don't really need it in my commercial environment.The brushes do a nice job of sweeping both my regular carpet, as well as the even firmer pile of my floor mats. It does such a well job that most of the year I no longer do daily vacuuming.Essentially, dollar for dollar, this has been a very good purchase despite its shortcomings.
