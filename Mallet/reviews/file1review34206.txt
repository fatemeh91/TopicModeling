review/text: This stuff is magic. I tried everything including prescription ointment and suppositories nothing worked. I bought this thinking it would work somewhat to relieve pain but to my surprise it eliminated all the pain. It really felt like a Popsicle up my bum. The relief is dramatic and lasted all day. None of the other ointments work anything even close to this. This is truly a miracle. Those Chinese really know their hemorrhoids, I'd like to thank them from the bottom of my bottom.The main ingredient is synthetic musk, have no idea why it works but whatever is in it has an instant and near total freezing power that numbs completely my whole butt. Wonderful stuff...I just started taking the pills that they suggest to take with these called Fargelin, I figure it's better to nip this thing in the butt and use everything possible to get them to heal or go away.Who knows maybe I can now go to bathroom without having to scream in agony. At least they kill the pain so half the battle is complete.
