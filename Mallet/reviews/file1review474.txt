review/text: First off...anyone who says it's a)too big, b)too smelly, or c)that it's too hard, had to have gotten a bum product.A) It is larger than your average vibrator, that's for sure, but it's smaller than the average penis. If you can accomodate a human, you can take this no problem. I took a measuring tape and wrapped it around the thickest part, it's only 5 inches around. Use lube though.B) It doesn't smell any more or less plastic-y than any other vibrator.C) Mine is quite pliable. While it doesn't bend, I didn't expect it to, but it is soft. But not too soft!! ;)I bought this because I wanted a thicker vibrator. And while I like a lot, I only gave it 4 stars for 2 reasons. First, the rabbit IS too high up the shaft. The ears hit about a quarter inch higher than they should, so the shaft can't go in all the way if you want them where they're supposed to go. Second, the insertable part is actually shorter than it looks, due to the placement of the rabbit. The beads are closer to the surface that my old one, so I definitely feel them. It's also incredibly quiet. It certainly got the job done, no doubt about that!!
