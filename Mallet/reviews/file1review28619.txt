review/text: My review is based solely on the taste of the ON Cookies and Cream Whey.Mixing: I use a big glass and a large spoon and stir. No clumps!With milk - It tastes great, like a vanilla milk shake. I find myself looking forward to my pre/post workout shake.With water - It tastes bad! I find myself using a chug technique just to get it down. I dread my protein shakes when I am cutting calories and remove milk from my diet.
