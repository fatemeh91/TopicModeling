review/text: This soap has made my life so much better. Anyone with athlete's foot knows how annoying it is ALL day long with shoes on. I am in the military and have to wear boots 14+ hours almost every day as I am on deployment. My athlete's foot was getting out of control but luckily this has almost cleared it up in a little over 2 weeks of daily use. Creams and powders weren't doing anything to help but I noticed that this soap did something from the first time I used it. Smells great too! I am going to put the rest of my friends and family on this if they ever get athlete's foot!
