review/text: I recently bought this sweeper. It works great and is easy to empty into the trash. I had read the reviews of others and was concerned about the handle - it seemed some people really were having problems with it. I got the item, read and followed the very simple directions and there is no problem with mine. It does not fall apart. It works perfectly. Here is the deal - the handle is made up of a few short metal tubes. As per the directions you assemble the handle and then place the handle (NOT attached to the sweeper yet) on a hard surface and tap with a hammer to set the handle pieces in place. Then connect to the sweeper. One end of the handle is threaded and it simply screws onto the base. My handle is secure - it does not fall apart. I can pick it up by the handle - no problem. I do not doubt that if I had not followed the directions that (now?) come with the sweeper and simply attached the handle together, that it would constantly fall apart.I bought the sweeper to pick up small pieces of dirt that my dog brings into the house - however it does a great job on a wide range of little things. The only two floor surfaces I have used it on are my low pile carpet and tile floor. It works GREAT on both. I love how quick, light, small, and well it works. I highly recommend this sweeper.
