review/text: I bought 2 triple boxes of these to replace the overpriced Sight Savers. I use these to clean my polycabonate eye glasses.I am not sure who came up with the solution for these , but they leave streaks and foggy areas- each and every time. I am shocked that a company like Zeiss would put their name on this product. I have tried these on binoculars and camera lenses- same result.Save yourself the grief and go get some lense cloths without the smudgy solution, and get a streak-free clean eyeglass or camera lense for pennies.
