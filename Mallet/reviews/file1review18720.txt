review/text: The chair is fantastic! Starting first with the assembly, I can tell you I'm fairly inept with building things and I was able to put this thing together with no trouble at all... Then, once you sit down in it... It's incredible! I used to have my legs and back ache from sitting in a bad office chair and now I have no problems like that at all. You'll want to make sure that you're either sitting by an outlet or that you can put the chair over by an outlet when you're not using it, so it can charge up the battery to massage (however, the battery life on it is pretty long, so it can charge up and then you can have it massage for quite a while!). I definitely recommend this chair as a purchase for anyone looking for a comfortable, soft, massaging chair.
