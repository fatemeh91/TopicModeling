review/text: We love Jarrow Pomegranate Juice Concentrate for it's high ORAC value and health benefits and we really love it for the taste and syrup-like consistency. (but only 36 calories per tbsp) We add it to everything from sparkling water to our morning smoothies- it isnt sugary sweet in any way, but it does have a nice natural sweetness combined with that pomegranate snap.We really wanted to comment on the care in which this product arrived from Vitacost- they did a beautiful job wrapping it so that the bottle would arrive safely and very quickly. We originally discovered this product at our local whole food store but availability was getting spotty as well as the price getting higher-- so now we will continue to order from Vitacost.
