review/text: My Mom was very elderly, and this product saved the day. In our instance, it worked as well or better than hoped. I questioned whether the spring action built into the seat would be strong enough to raise my Mom up. But it was a great resource for us. It was so much less expensive than a powered one, especially if pennies are being counted in elder years. My Mom weighed around 140 lbs. Am guessing that every situation is unique, but our experience with this was very good. Also, I believe this product works best when someone just needs assistance standing, but is still able to ambulate somewhat.
