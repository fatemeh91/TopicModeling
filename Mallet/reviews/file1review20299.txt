review/text: I gave these one star because I think they are unsuitable for the intended use as a cloth diaper. I bought these thinking they were comparable to the prefold cloth diapers that I have used as burp cloths in the past.... you should be aware that they are very, very thin. They are so thin that they are transparent. Even when I folded them they didn't seem half as thick and absorbant as the prefolds. The prefold diapers are much more suitable for cloth diapering and burp cloth use... spend the extra $$$ on them. These probably will make nice rags for cleaning.... but I definitely don't recommend them as diapers or burp cloths.
