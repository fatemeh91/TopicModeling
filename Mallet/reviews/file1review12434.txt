review/text: Tried several cans of this cr*p (only because Home Depot and Lowe's no longer carry my favorite RAID Wasp and Hornet killer) and it works NOT at all. Went back to RAID when I found it... and RAID Wasp and Hornet Killer is still the BEST on the planet - will knock a wasp or yellow jacket out of the air, straight down with no flyaway. Don't waste your money on this Johnson crap.But why, oh why, is my Amazon page showing the Raid can for the Johnson SC Wasp/Hornet Killer?
