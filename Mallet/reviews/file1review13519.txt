review/text: After one use the tips of my toes are blistered! Granted, I have the kind of feet where the second toe is longer than my big toe but it's not a problem for the other insoles I've used. These insoles put your feet in a downward position...like a mini heel inside your shoe. Because of that, your toes are pushed to the front of your shoe the entire time you're walking or jogging. I literally took my shoes off and walked the rest of the way home, barefoot! I came home and put my Spenco cross-trainer insoles back into my shoes and it felt like a dream once again! I think these insoles would be much better if they extended the length of the shoe so your feet were protected all the way down, like normal insoles. I will be happy to send them to you if you'd like to lose a toenail too, like I'm clearly about to do! :)
