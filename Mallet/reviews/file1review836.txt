review/text: These are foam earplugs, and you roll/squeeze them with your fingers, then stuff them into your ears where they expand to fill the ear canal. They stay in pretty well and are simple to use, but they feel scratchy to me and not terribly effective. I greatly prefer the silicone earplugs called "Mack's Ear Pillows". They are more comfortable and block out sound better.
