review/text: I am the pickest eater! I love these shakes and they work I take it with their multi-vitamin, cell activator, personalized protein powder, and total control. I do not like taking pills so I just blend in the multi-vitamin, protein and total control. I take the cell activator by mouth because it leaves a peppery taste in the shake. I'm super sensitive to caffeine so I only mix Total Control into my morning shake. If I take more than one Total Control my heart races like crazy and I feel anxious.I feel great and have energy! These meal replacements fit into my busy lifestyle so well. Which is why I started because I never have time to eat breakfast or lunch which causes my metabolism to crash at least now I'm doing something healthy and my metabolism is in a better place than it was! My son always begs to drink my shake so now I have to buy him the kids shakes.
