review/text: This is one part of my over-complicated shaving routine. I have ultra sensitive skin and after shaving I need something to help soothe and moisturize my skin. For those who have ultra-sensitive skin I recommend this, however, I recommend adding a mild salicylic acid face wash sometime afterwards if you are prone to acne or ingrown hairs(Neutrogena Acne Stress Control Foaming Wash works great for adults). For those interested I also use: American Crew Pre-shave Oil, Bump Patrol Cool Shave Gel, and the previously mentioned foaming wash. I've changed other products over the years but this aftershave remains necessary for moisturizing.
