review/text: I had a goatee trimmer like this that I have been using for 6 or 7 years. I decided to upgrade to a fancy beard trimmer a couple of months ago, and my goatee has been a mess ever since. I saw this trimmer by chance on Amazon, so I picked it up because it was at a low price. I love it! It gives a close trim, easy to hold, and is a no nonsense. This is a lot like the one I bought years ago, I should have stuck with what worked instead of wasting money to upgrade.
