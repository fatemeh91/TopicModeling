review/text: Device is simple, inexpensive, and very easy to use. I'm very happy with the purchase.It's effective trimming both my beard and mustache. The thumbwheel used to set the length of the hair has a wide adjustable range and has clearly visible numbers so you can always dial in the same setting that works best for you. The recharging technology for this trimmer is NiCAD. For Li-ION, you'd probably have to pay a bit more.
