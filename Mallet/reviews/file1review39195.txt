review/text: After deciding that I didn't want to pay $20 for a haircut in Harvard Square, I decided to purchase this kit. It's really simple to use - the instructional DVD, while far from elite, makes hair clipping easy. My girlfriend watched the video (with me) and cut my hair right afterwards, and it turned out rather well. Make sure to watch the DVD though, if you are a beginner: my roommate's girlfriend didn't watch the video and cut a somewhat interesting hairstyle on my roommate's head.
