review/text: Let me just say that this brush is amazing, I read reviews and long considered buying this brush because of the price. Looking at it after owning the product for a few days, I do not regret the decision at all.The feeling in my mouth after each 2min brushing session is the same as going to the dentist and having my mouth cleaned, except this occurs 2 times a day instead of the once a year or so dentist appointment.The flossaction brush head is my favorite, as it cleans in between your teeth as well.I love all electronic gadgets and this thing is that and so much more.Get it, NOW!
