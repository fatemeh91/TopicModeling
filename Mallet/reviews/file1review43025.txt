review/text: My doctor suggested this product because I'm expecting twins. I was hesitant about it because of the way it looks, but decided to get it based on the good reviews. I'm now 28weeks; purchased it at 24 weeks. I am very happy with this belt, wear it for about 10 hours a day. I could not still be working 9 hour days if it wasn't for this product. I even wear it around the house. The product appears to be good on the size. I am 5'3 and now 124 lbs. I wear the belt on the second hook now, although I'm transitioning to the third hook, but its still too big. Wardrobe choices are limited because of the straps in the front ; although, I've been able to use clothing tape to hide the straps with some shirts. I recommend that you wear a tank top underneath for more comfort.
