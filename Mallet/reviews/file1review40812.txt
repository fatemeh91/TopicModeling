review/text: No I don't seem to cut myself anymore even when shaving in the slippery shower!The shaving 'soap' is made so that my legs and under-arms feel silky when I'm done. It doesn't seem to dry my skin out. And I don't use one of the refills made with special non-drying products!The handle grip could be made a little less slippery when shaving underwater.I am able to go around knobby areas like my knees and not have to worry overmuch that I'm going to slice them open by going to fats. Don't get me wrong you can still cut yourswelf, it is just that to do so takes a lot more effort.o
