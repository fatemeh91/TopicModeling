review/text: I'm perfectly happy with this product. I went by ratings & reviews, plus reserching the best kinds before ordering it. I love that it's a softgel capsul! It is still a very large pill, but much easier to swallow. I ran out & needed some right away, so bought a bottle of the hard pills. The hard pills are even bigger. The coating makes them hard to swallow & it makes me nauseated. Since I'm going to need to take it for awhile, I'm sticking with the softgel. I have to take them because I am taking the 50,000 IU prescription Vitamin D & have suffered &#34;heart symptoms&#34; from it since I began taking it (palpitations, rapind heart rate, high bp,etc. After doing research (my doctor didn't know what was wrong), I discovered some people who take it, get these symptoms, especially if they are already deficient in magnesium. If I take the magnesium twice a day, the symptoms ease considerably.
