review/text: My 85 year old mother was taking antibiotics for pneumonia and her chest was not clearing up and the meds made her out of it. She started taking the bronchial soothe and her chest cleared up with out any side effects. I recommend this product for anyone suffering with bronchial issues. We keep mom stocked with it.
