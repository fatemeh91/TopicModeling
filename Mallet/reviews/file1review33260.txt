review/text: This item is nice to use, with heat or cold. I would suggest it too others. The only down side is the rice tends to move around and it would be nice if the seams with baffled so the rice would stay evenly distributed. Other then that, it is a nice alternative to a heating pad, if u want something cozy and warm and therapeutic without cords to drag around.
