review/text: Your inventory of Futuro Knee braces is bad and is being investigated by one of your Customer Service persons. I speak with confidence because I have worn the same brand, style, and size brace for years. The first shipment of 2 braces consisted of one correct package but the other was a "small" size clearly marked [package and product lable] as "medium". When the exchange shipment arrived, both packages contained "small" size braces but the lables and packages were clearly marked "medium".Both shipments have been returned in the last few days. In my mind this is obviously a manufacturers problem. To this day Amazon has been trying to resolve this issue. I am waiting for instructions on how to obtain the proper items.
