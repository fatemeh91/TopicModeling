review/text: The very first time I used the lingerie bag for my delicates in the wash, the zipper broke. When I looked closer, I saw that the metal fastener on the right side of the bag was ripped and it caught one of my delicate items. My remaining my delicate items were wrapped around the agitator of the washing machine. I am very disappointed that the lingerie bag did not protect my delicates and that it broke on its very first use.
