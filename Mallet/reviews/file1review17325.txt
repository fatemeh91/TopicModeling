review/text: I bought this trimmer based on the multitude of good reviews. Everyone seemed to be impressed with the product. After using it for a few days, it has proved to be exactly what I needed. Has nine different lengths to choose from and you can even remove the trimmer guard to get close definition. Comes with a beard/mustache comb and cleaning brush. You can't beat the value for this price!
