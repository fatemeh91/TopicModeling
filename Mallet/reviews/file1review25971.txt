review/text: My husband has had a medical watch for 2 1/2 years which worked fine until it suddenly died.I immediately ordered another one because he has to take meds several times a day.This watch seemed ok, but it would take several days to arrive. I ordered and was really surprised when it arrived before the expected day.I did not request rush service. It was sealed in the box and works fine. Shipping speed was exceptional
