review/text: I bought this somewhat reluctantly because I had a clipper set I purchased at a local store which never worked well. Clippers for me only work if you want a "buzz" cut.This Wahl clipper set is AWESOME! I was able to cut my sons hair and my husbands hair no problem. The instructional DVD helped me know how to do it. Very simple...anyone can do it. The first one or two haircuts and it is paid for. And great for little kids...you don't have to worry about them refusing to go near a stranger and scissors are impossible with little hands grabing all around. These clippers are safe, they won't cut little hands. I love this item! Well worth the money!
