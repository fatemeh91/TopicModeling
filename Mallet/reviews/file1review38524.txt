review/text: I tried using the tiny nail clippers on our newborn and ended up clipping her fingers twice! I felt so bad. These are much safer and easier to use. I love the design but they are also quality and get the job done easily. Great value. Pack these in your hospital bag when you deliver, you will need them!
