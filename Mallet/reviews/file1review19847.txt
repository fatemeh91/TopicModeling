review/text: My little girl can sit on here just fine and it even fits a German toilet!!!! I am very impressed with the seat itself. I give it 4 stars because I think the price is a little outrageous. I also left a review for the seller, I paid a hefty amount in shipping and it took literally FOREVER to get it here. The matching stool arrived almost 2 weeks before the toilet did.
