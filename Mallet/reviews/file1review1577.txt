review/text: This is a good product, staying in place because it's like vaseline, however expect several months before you would get rid of your wart with this. It's peels your skin and you can feel the tingling when applied, your skin to peel within couple of days if follow directions. Then a light scrubbing. But what I found out works quicker is to cut a thin slice to lime and rub in on the wart and using the lime skin as exfolient. Because what a wart is is that it lives on the top layer of the skin forming a skin matrix (due to abnormal growth). So basically this medicine intended to gently wear down the matrix gradually, but I didnt have time. I wanted it gone and quick, so the lime works from just two days to use, though I did draw blood breaking down the food supply of the wart (capillaries).
