review/text: There are a few reasons this product stands out among whey protein powders. The main reason is because it's actually whey protein. Other protein powders such as Gaspari Myofusion aren't actually protein, rather a protein blend. This is 100% whey, which definitely makes it authentic and pure. Another reason is the amount of servings you get for the price. For every flavor there are at least 70 servings for the 5 lbs. Other top protein powders such as Syntha 6 and Gaspari Myofusion have less than 60 for 5lbs. 10+ servings is a huge difference when it comes to protein powders. Add in the fact that the price is the same or less than the others gives this a huge advantage. The best protein powder if you are trying to lose weight without losing muscle or gain weight and muscle. It doesn't contain a lot of carbs or fat either.
