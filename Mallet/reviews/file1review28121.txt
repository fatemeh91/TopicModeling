review/text: I've only tried this product with skim milk thus far, but its taste far exceeded my expectations -- it tastes exactly like chocolate milk to me. I was concerned I wouldn't like the taste due to the artificial sweetener (which sometimes has a strange aftertaste in foods), but I honestly can't tell the difference between this and a product that uses pure sugar. An awesome way to take care of that protein deficiency in my diet.
