review/text: I love these prenatals for a couple different reasons. First, I love that they are a natural vitamin, without icky things added to them. Second, they have some benefits other prenatals don't: probiotics, and ginger which help ease the stomach (a sometimes very vital thing in a pregnant woman :) With the exception of two months, I have been either pregnant or nursing for the last 5 years. These vitamins help me feel good and it seems to me that they would be absorbed better by the body, because there is food based nutrition in these. I know some women get constipated from their prenatals, but this has NEVER been an issue with me while I have been taking these. And these have a LOT of iron (the cause of constipation). Also, these are very comparable or even cheaper in price to many other prenatals. Overall, a worthwhile product.
