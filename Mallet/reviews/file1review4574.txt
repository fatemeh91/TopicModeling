review/text: This succesor to the Mach3 has the same style and sizing, but does the job better.Unfortunately with many of the reviews here, you can't tell what the person used before, what their skin and hair type are, etc. So for me: sensitive skin, heavy coarse fast-growing black whiskers. I normally used a combination of the Mach3Turbo and the Sensor3.I need a very close shave to make it look like I shaved at all, and to get there usually leaves my skin a bit irritated especially around larger follicles, so I'm very picky about my blades. I also have facial hair and need to shape and work around that.The Fusion replaced my Mach3 and does a better job; it gets a little closer, smoother, and less irritating to my skin, with maybe one fewer pass than I used before. I get fewer nicks than before. The single-blade in the back is of limited use, only good for stray hairs in odd places rather than actual shaping, but that's what it's advertised to do.For shaping, I still have to get my Sensor3 out. The Fusion is probably a bad choice for those of you with a combination of elaborate Wolverine sideburns, long goatee, and handlebar mustache. If you shave a larger part of your face, it should work well.Perhaps since it gets so close to the skin, for those not used to a close shave or who didn't properly prep (eg, people migrating from electric or disposable razors) you might find the multi-blades pulled at your whiskers.I've posted a comparison photo of the Mach3 and Fusion, for people making the same migration.The biggest drawback is the ever-more expensive blades.If you liked the Mach3, or shave a large area of your face "correctly" (correctly lubricated and with/perpendicular to the grain), this is highly recommended.
