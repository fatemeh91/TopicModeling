review/text: I love this stuff. I have a lot of issues with water-based lubes. At worst, it immediately burns my skin due to chemical preservatives in it. At best, it dries up too quickly. Wet Naturals makes some good water-based lube, but even that dries too quickly.This stuff feels great, and it lasts. It eventually becomes less slippery and does need reapplication sometimes, but leaves the skin feeling soft and smooth rather than sticky. And it easily lasts two to three times as long as any water-based lube I've tried.
