review/text: First bought Castle Forbes through representative at a local store. What a great product. Great smell and the smoothest shave of anything that I've tried out. Only place I can find it is on Amazon. It's great for sensative skin and a little bit is all you need. Depending on how often you shave this can last 4 + months.
