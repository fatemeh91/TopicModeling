review/text: I still believe this razor for the most part is a gimick. Tonight when shaving I changed the cartridge that came on the handle to the spare on the back of the case and I got much better results. I took a closer look at the original cartridge and it didn't look right. Looks dull to me, no wonder I was getting cut up bad. I have contacted Gillette and I'm waiting for a response. I hope this isn't some kind of manufacturing flaw, but if it is this razor should be recalled or we should be compensated.Anybody else have this problem?
