review/text: I bought the Ambu res-cue mask more to get to the $25 minimum for free shipping but was pretty surprised at the quality feel of this thing. I have played with it enough that I am kind of surprised it hasn't fallen apart yet. It comes in a nice, sturdy case and hope I get to use it for real some day.
