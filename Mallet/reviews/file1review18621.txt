review/text: I ordered the bridge threaders and the description read 10 per pack, 10 envelopes so I ordered a quantity of six expecting to receive a quantity of 600. Instead I received a quantity of 60. When I contacted the company they explained that there was an error in the description and I could return them for a full refund. Why couldn't they just send what I expected when I ordered. Plus they charged $4.95 for shipping an envelope that was delivered first class mail. I will not be ordering these again.
