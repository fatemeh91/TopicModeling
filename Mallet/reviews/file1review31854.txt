review/text: I have used countless different facial moisturizers and aftershave balms. This is easily the worst. While it has a good scent, it does not fully absorb into your skin. It will leave an oily film on your skin making it look and feel greasy. Just terrible given the price point. If you are in the market for a good post-shave moisturizer, for high end product both Anthony for Men and Jack Black make great products. I even like Olay's Regenerist. If you only want to spend $5, use Every Man Jack's post-shave moisturizer. I cannot stress enough how bad this product is. It is a HUGE step down from the quality of the shaving cream. Nobody wants a greasy/oily face, especially when the product is $30-$40.
