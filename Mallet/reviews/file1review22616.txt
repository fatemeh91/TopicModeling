review/text: I did the Ultimate Cleanse first to clean out my system. It had been sluggish for a long time. I felt MUCH better after that. Then I started the Crave Less/Burn More part. I definitely had fewer cravings and did eat less. I don't know if just that is why I lost, or if the Burn More helped as well. The weight loss took a couple of months, and I lost 8 pounds. That was fine because that's about all I really needed to lose. It was slow, subtle, and I felt really good and really healthy the whole time.
