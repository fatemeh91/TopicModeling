review/text: I use this powder in addition to the grain-free dry food to help my cat digest his food. I just add it to the dry food and the white powder lightly coats the kibble. There really is no odor or smell to it, my cats could definitely see there was a difference, but haven't stopped eating their food because of it. No more diarrhea or gas issues with my IBS cat, I highly recommed this product over the forti flora packets.
