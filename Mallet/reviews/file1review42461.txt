review/text: I really really appreciate this product. Particularly because of its natural content and the fact that it was created from using actual rose petals and not just the oil (although that is not neccesarily bad either). I just find this uniquely authentic and am thankful I found it as such. It is very ideal for affecting the energy and vibes in any given place. As well, it is a nice and warm fragrance that is there but not to heavily strong but just right. Great for linens and all sorts of things really. The sky is indeed the limit. Enjoy yours. I hope to order this again too just hope by then maybe it is a little lower priced. In any case the bottle is a good size and even comes with a spray dispencer. Delivery was also quick which is great.
