review/text: I purchased two, thinking I could give one to my mom. I go it in the mail and opened it up, the first one was missing a part and I couldn't set it up. The second one had all the parts, but was not able to hold the weight of my dryer. I was not happy and had to pay $20+ to return it. If you are going to buy this at least keep the box it comes in so you can return it.
