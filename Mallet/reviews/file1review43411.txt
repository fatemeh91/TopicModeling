review/text: I think this could have been one of the best things I bought for myself while I was pregnant. My belly got VERY big. I honestly think it kept me from getting severe edema in my legs like I did with my previous pregnancy. It also helped a little with keeping my hip pain from getting any worse than it did (and OH MY it was bad). I recommend this belt to anyone having problems with pelvic girdle pain during pregnancy. Or if you just need a little extra support from a big baby belly!!
