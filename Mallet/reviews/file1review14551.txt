review/text: I couldn't believe how little I needed to use. A tube will go a very long way. It softened my feet the first time I used it, and I didn't feel like I was going to skate across the floor! The moisturizing effect lasted all day without a greasy feeling. It worked great on my rough knees, too. This product is definitely a keeper!!
