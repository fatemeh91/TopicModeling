review/text: I bought this in July 2011 and I have been using it ever since. I was really pleased with the performance and like the fact you can charge from the car also. Comes with rechargeable batteries too! Can't beat the value for the price. In fact tonight I am ordering a second one because I have so many batteries to charge.
