review/text: Definitely has effects, and I intend to keep using it, but I feel the need to cycle my intake maybe a week at a time, interrupted by a week of non-use. If I read the literature correctly, this substance might deplete your catecholamine neurotransmitters with continual use. It did seem to lose it's effectiveness over time. Maybe a catecholamine precursor will help.
