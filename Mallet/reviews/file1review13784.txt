review/text: I bought three of these for friends and NONE work. The light worked for about 10 seconds on one. Then when we pressed the light button again (gently I might add), it made a clicking noise and the light no longer worked. The other two were duds right out of the package. Excess packaging too! (If the website would let me give this item NO STARS, I would have chosen that option)
