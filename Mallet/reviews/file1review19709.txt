review/text: Have been using this toilet trainer for several weeks to toilet train a toddler. Item arrived exactly as pictured/described. Fits on toilet seat well and nice to be able to adjust it to different size seats. The child is comfortable on the seat, and the seat doesn't wiggle around when the child gets on/off. I was also considering the Prince Lionheart toilet trainer seat, but am very happy I got the Baby Bjorn.
