review/text: Firstly about this listing, thumbnail shows the current US model but the listing's main image shows an older yellow-box model, so which one is it? I have been using the current US model for 6 years now, I also imported theSoladey-3 Ionic SOLAR Toothbrush! One of the most effective ways to remove plaque! INCLUDED is 1 brush and 4 replacement heads. REDwhen it first came out years ago in Japan cos' having mini solar panels on my toothbrush handle is so gadget-cool! The Ionic Toothbrush beats that Soladey-3 any day, hard proof: With this toothbrush, I never saw any mold/bacterial buildup ever, I credit this to its negative ion generation which has a mild sanitizing effect. With the other brand, blackish bacterial buildup can be seen visually within weeks (onto the same head protecting cap) and my bathroom is very well-lit by natural sunlight too. This tells you how lil' negative ions (if any) the other brand generates. The solar panel is so gimmicky.Back to this one, I give it only 4 stars for the following reasons:1) A newer model (called Ion Power Kiss You) has been out in Japan for almost 1.5 years now, yet it's still not exported to the US. UPDATE: Earthority.com carries the new model!!2) The new Japanese model is available in FOUR colors, EIGHT replacement head shapes, TWO bristle firmness, and even a Tongue Cleaner head too! I WANT THE NEW MODEL!Luckily, heads for the new models are backward-compatible with the old models. So you can easily upgrade yours with the new heads.
