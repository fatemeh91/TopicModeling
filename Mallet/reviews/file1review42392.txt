review/text: Mom's knee has been giving her trouble for the last five years and she was reduced to taking Aleve. Joint Synergy was suggested by a friend and the price was so reasonable, we figured we'd give it a try. WOW!! Instant relief and it lasts at least four fours with no, absolutely no side effects. One look at the ingredients and now.....you know the rest of the story!
