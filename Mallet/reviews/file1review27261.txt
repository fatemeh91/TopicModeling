review/text: Tastes great and high quality. After reading that consumer report which showed a number of top whey protein shakes (like Muscle Milk) had bad for you heavy metals, I sought out this powder because it scored well on food safety. Happy to report it also tastes great. Tastes best with milk but doable with water if you just want the protein and no carbs.
