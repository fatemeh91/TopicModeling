review/text: Before using Oxy Powder I was going to the bathroom ONCE every two weeks. I was trying to lose weight. I was sticking to a 1250 calorie diet excering 4 days a week. I was burning out about 4000-5000 calories a week and still wasnt losing any weight. I knew something had to give. Ive had a colonoscopy done and doctors are still trying to figure out whats wrong. I took it upon myself and tried out Oxy Powder within 3 hours of taking it I went to the bathroom. The first time I had gone in 7 days. The next day I went 5 times. It continued to get better from there. Just in the first three days from taking it I went from 162 down to 158. No it isnt that much but to see that much of a change from just using the bathroom was good news to me. If you are having similar issues please try product. I am moody bloated and all of the above when I am not able to use the bathroom. I honestly feel like a new me. The sun is shining brighter birds are chirping louder. I LOVE IT!!!
