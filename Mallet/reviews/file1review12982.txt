review/text: This item advertises to be exactly what cervical neck pain sufferers need but it does not live up to its description.The concept is excellent but the fit is awkward, complicated and does not hold the cold or really get that cold. The add says 20F but I seriously doubt it. Other reviews mention it not staying warm either. We thought the cold might be more lasting but it wasn't. Try something else.
