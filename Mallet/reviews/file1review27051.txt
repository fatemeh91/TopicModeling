review/text: This stuff tastes great, with water it tastes like Yoohoo, with milk it tastes like a very chocolatey chocolate milk lol. It is highly filling, and has very noticeable results, not to mention 24 grams of protein per serving, I use two scoops, so it's 48 grams of protein per serving for me, twice a day.
