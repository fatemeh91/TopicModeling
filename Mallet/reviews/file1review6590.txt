review/text: This item does as it says ok. I wouldn't say it saved by back or is as good as other tools that I've tried.It is sturdy and applies nice/decent pressure to pressure points. It's not very good for rolling pressure/"massage". It's shape is a bit awkward for some-- it depends on your size and back height, I suppose. Overall, it's an ok/fine item.. but not a miracle worker. It's a bit tiring and tedious to hit the right pressure points with it. I wouldn't buy it again for my purposes, but the item itself seems to last ok. Just too awkward to use, not relaxing, and can't hit the right spots on me.
