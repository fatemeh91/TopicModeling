review/text: I thought I'd give this a try, as I never seem to be able to find cold, sugar-based wax at any of my local drugstores. For some bizarre reason, upon applying this to my leg and pressing either a muslin or paper/fiber paper to the "wax", it stayed on my leg when I did the usual "pull skin taut, quickly remove strip in direction opposite of hair growth" move. I thought maybe the "pre-waxing" alcohol based lotion they provided was causing these results, so I repeated the process on my other leg, omitting the lotion. Alas, I was still stuck with an inferior product.I've been inflicting this on myself for years and have had very successful results with other brands (that seem to only be available in Canada), as well as middling results with others. I certainly wouldn't bother with this line again.
