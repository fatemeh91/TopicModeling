review/text: Ordered this item on Thursday and it came to my doorstep on FRIDAY! And I chose standard shipping! How awesome is that!! :) Also, this whey protein tastes pretty good. I got the Chocolate Fudge flavor. It's one of the whey proteins out there that doesn't have much sodium or fat or sugar or carbs in it which is good for someone on a clean diet. I hope they get the cafe mocha flavor in soon bc I want to try it! but so far, this is the best whey protein I've ever tried!
