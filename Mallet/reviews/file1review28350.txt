review/text: This is an easy to mix protein powder. I mix it in skim milk and it does not clump up like other protein products,it blends into the milk. It taste good in skim milk but taste great in whole milk. it comes with a spoon inside the container. Also the sodium level is 130 not 60 as listed in the description.
