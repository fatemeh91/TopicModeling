review/text: I have to buy these for my elderly Aunt and have a hard time finding them in stores. The one store I find them at doesn't always have them in stock all of the time and when they do, I have to buy them in bulk and wind up spending a fortune. I'm so grateful to have found these online! They are so much cheaper and easier to get! These stocking help her so much with her circulation in her legs!
