review/text: I really enjoy the Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard. I get the vanilla creme and add some strawberries and blueberries to make a smoothie. I don't think there is a lot of flavor in the vanilla so the Whey taste is mild to me. I haven't tried any of the other flavors but I really like the ratio of protein to carbs and sugars so that is what is most important. It mixes nicely and makes a creamy milkshake with some ice and a base of EAS Carb Control drink (instead of water). I also use the Apex 100% whey Protein and would recommend either one.
