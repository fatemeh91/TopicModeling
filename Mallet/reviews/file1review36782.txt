review/text: I had a simular item to this one, I got while in hospital and it lasted about 3 years before plastic broke. I made a mistake I ordered 3 of the Maddack Deluxe flexible Sock and Stocking aid;white and the White material around one is raveling very bad. I have not opened one of the remaining 2. I had planed to use one for a gift, but this changed my mind. I do not recommend this item.
