review/text: I have an area rug that shows every bit of lint, etc. It gets lots of traffic so the Swift Sweeper if perfect to sweep up without having to drag the big vacuum cleaner out. The only drawback is, the handle kept coming apart every time I lifted the sweeper, so I taped the three parts of the handle together.
