review/text: I was hoping I would like this, but I am not sure yet. I thought when I initially used it, it worked ok, but the more I used it I realized I couldn't hear with it as well as I would like. I find myself going back to my old 1. The head (heart) is large and it is sort of hard to get it in the right place on small arms. I also notice that when I am holding it to listen to a BP that there is a lot of noise (which is from me holding it in place)
