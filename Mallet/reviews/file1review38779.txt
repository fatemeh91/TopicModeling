review/text: I signed up for the continues supply program for the slim fast, to save a few dollars each month, since I know I will be using it on a monthly bases. But what I wasn't expecting was how large it was when I revived it. The price led me to think it would be a small amount, nope its huge, and compared to its price, its a awesome deal. The same size in the store alone would cost you $25-$30 dollars. Here its like $15 bucks - awesome! The taste is rich and delicious, I've so far have lost 3pounds in 1 week, I blend mine with fat free milk, and chopped ice. It makes you feel full for hours, at least 3 hours I feel full and a total of 5 hours before I'm hungry again. You have to replace 2 meals and have 1 healthy meal. I replace my breakfast by blending it with fat free milk and fruit in a morning shake. For lunch I have 1/2 a sandwich and 1/2 glass of slim-fast, for dinner I have a normal healthy dinner (soup, or turkey) then just before 8pm I drink my 2nd 1/2 of slim-fast and that keeps me from getting up in the middle of the night for a snack. I stay full and I'm still loosing weight. Its what works for me, and that's all that matters.
