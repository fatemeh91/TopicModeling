review/text: OK first let me start off by saying I've been messing with these flavors for years. chocolate, double rich chocolate, Vanilla, cookies and cream..... UGGGGHHHHHHH they make me sick just thinking about them now. So I read some reviews online and found that people were saying the banana cream mixes better and masks the whey taste you get with some of the others.I jumped in and ordered it...... WOW it mixes easily and taste sooo good if you like bananas like me this is a no brainier.
