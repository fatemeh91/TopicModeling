review/text: In spite of its impressive 40% salcylic acid content and the fact that it has no odor, after trying out PediFix Wart Stick for a couple of weeks, I found that it just does not work very well. It did not seem to do anything at all for me, probably because the active ingredient is suspended in a chapstick-like medium and not much of it actually got absorbed into the wart tissue. It is also quite difficult to "pinpoint-apply" the substance. Subsequently, I wound up spending a couple of extra bucks and purchased "Compound W - Gel." In contrast to PediFix, it absorbs quickly into the tissue, and, because of the way the tube is designed, pinpoint accuracy of application is no longer a problem. Like PediFix, it also has no odor. Unlike PediFix, it contains only 17% salcylic acid. Yet, the result was that it actually has substantially (85 -90% so far) removed the Wart in only a few days.I recommend "Compound W - Gel", which is easy to apply, has no odor, and actually works!
