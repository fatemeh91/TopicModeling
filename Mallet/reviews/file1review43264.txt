review/text: It helped me a great deal with my twin pregnancy. It provides support like it claims and I noticed a world of difference when I wore it versus when I did not. Mostly wore it at work initially but now that I am close to term, I wear it when I have to stand in the kitchen for an hour or so. Definitely makes a very noticeable difference on the pressure I felt while standing when I did not have it on. It also helped with the pelvic pain I started having around 6 months due to Symphysis Pubis Dysfunction. That was my reason to order the belt in the first place. Now that I am farther along, the pain is completely gone. Not sure if this is because of the belt alone or the problem fixed itself.Now for the negatives, it shows under all my clothing. People definitely look at the straps if they don't ask what it is for. Looks like some heavy duty bra straps and are quite unsightly. That did not deter me from wearing to work every single day as it helped me with the pain and pressure. If the straps were made to look more like a camisole, it would have been less embarrassing. Another thing is putting it on is not all that easy and comfortable since it does not have any hooks etc. Again, a minor discomfort for the good it does.I would highly recommend this if you can brave the ugly straps for a couple of months.
