review/text: I used Purina's Forti-flora for my cat, which developed diarrhea after extended antibiotic use. He never showed any improvement even after using the product for over two months. The diarrhea continued along with increased appetite and increased thirst.I received a sample of Pro-bios powder from theProbiotic Smart Store(via Amazon) with an order for Forti-flora. I tried the Pro-bios, and within 24 hours of ingestion of this pro-biotic, my cat's diarrhea stopped, and his appetite and thirst levels also returned to normal.I had another cat to which I gave the Forti-flora for chronic medicine-induced diarrhea. For six months she kept the chronic diarrhea and also exhibited the increased appetite and thirst. I never suspected that the Forti-flora was making things worse, and because of the chronic diarrhea, she died. I am relating this story just in case anyone else has a similar experience. Your pets are like family.The Pro-bios Contains four species of live naturally occurring lactic acid bacteria including three species of Lactobacillus (acidophilus, plantarum, casei) along with Enterococcus faecium. the Forti-flora contains only one.Probios Dispersible Powder 240 grams (approximately 48 portions)
