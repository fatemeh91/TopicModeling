review/text: I am a night clencher, not a grinder, and after wasting good money on a boil-fixed, teeth-molded dental guard that was uncomfortable and hard, I invested in this guard of different design. What a major difference: it is comfortable; easy to get used to; of softer, cushioning plastic; and supportive of mouth relaxation during sleep. This item is the middle level of three products by this company and has the advantage over the first by having retaining wings to prevent slippage. If you are a grinder, I do not know how well the guard will stand up to the rubbing and friction (it is guaranteed for 3 months), but for clenchers, it is excellent.
