review/text: Four stars for nice little bright yellow medical kit. The nice thing is that there's room to add more of what you desire in a medical kit, such as a supply of any prescription meds, etc. Having worked in graphic design, I know that yellow is the first color you notice, so if you need to get to this quickly, it will be easy to find. It says the bag is water-tight, which is a plus. Both the water-tight feature and yellow color make it a smart place to enclose a copy of your important documents! I included these in our emergency grab-and go bags--I already had a different first aid kit in my car. The elders in our congregation advise having a grab-and-go backpack to get family through 3 to 5 days in case of disaster. My sister works for Homeland Security, and she advises that, too. After five days, I would rely on faith in my God, Jehovah, to get me through... I was able to find everything I needed for emergency backpack on Amazon, which was nice to have it delivered instead of having to drive and search through lots of different stores. The only thing keeping me from giving this medical kit five stars is that it doesn't already include everything you'll need. But, I prefer this one due to the convenience of the size, the color, being water-tight, and the room to add more.
