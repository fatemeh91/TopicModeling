review/text: BAM BAM's review was trashing Amazon, but it was supposed to be a review of the ITEM (the batteries), not Amazon.The batteries are great. Buying them online saves half the cost of in-store purchasing. I'm not sure if they actually last 2x as long...it would be hard to ever tell that, but I took them on a 4 day fishing trip, and shot about 188 pictures and 4 different videos totaling about 15 min together, and the batteries never showed any signs of running low - my 'low bat.' light never came on. Granted, 99% of those pictures were in daylight, with flash not being used, but my LCD screen is always on. That's a lot of pictures from a $2 set of batteries.Oxyride is the new standard I believe. Excellent.
