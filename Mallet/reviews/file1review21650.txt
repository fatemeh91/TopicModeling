review/text: My daughter is 16 months and we got this since she was growing out of her other bath. She loves it, there is a lot more room in it then I thought, it is cushioned and the real miracle that I never expected to work was the plastic hook to hang the bath on..... it actually stays up. When have you ever had one of those that actually sticks. It is great because it hangs up in the bath and doesn't effect us taking showers.For less then $20 you can't go wrong.
