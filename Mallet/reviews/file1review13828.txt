review/text: i've been getting cold sores on my lip since i was a little kid. i've tried everything from abreva to those creams the doctor prescribes. finally i decided to try this since nothing else was working. If you feel a cold sore coming on, you just put this little liquid on a q-tip and dab it on your lip a few times a day. guess what? the cold sore doesn't get bigger, in fact it shrinks within a few days and no one has to know you even had one. the stuff smells of strong herbal stuff. I never worry if i will get one coming on because i know i'll get rid of it before it's visible! It's really worth your money.
