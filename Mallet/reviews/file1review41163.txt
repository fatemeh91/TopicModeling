review/text: Got these as overnight protection for our 5 year old Autistic son. He was having leaks with Pampers Goodnights, so we tried these. Not only did they leak just as bad (if not worse), the filling came out to cover him in clear "crystals". The peach mat is not up far enough and /or absorbent enough for a male side sleeper. Very disappointed!
