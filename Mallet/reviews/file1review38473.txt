review/text: I received this product a few days ago. I used it for the first time tonight. First, I must say that I am not too fond of the shape and design. But I worked with it. The first place I used this Emjoi Optima was on my underarms. IT WAS PAINFUL. On a scale of 1-10 I gave the pain a 20. I had to stop and start over and over again. I didn't even have that much hair because I had shaved just a couple of days before I decided to use this product. Less hair does not necessary mean less pain.For me the pain was just unbearable. It took me 1 1/2 hours just to do under both underarms. After I was done with both armpits I was VERY HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS AND THAT THE PAIN WAS WORTH IT. IT REMOVED ALL THE HAIRS. I will never use a razor on my underarms again. This product is it for me. This was my main focus. Shaving with a razor just didn't remove all the hairs and the more I tried to shave it the more the bumps would appear from shaving. I just hope that by using this product no more bumps will show up and that I will just have smooth soft underarms.
