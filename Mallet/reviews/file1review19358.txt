review/text: This product is called a "mattress cover". I may be wrong, but I made the mistake of thinking a "mattress cover" would cover/protect the ENTIRE mattress (like a big sack). I thought it was a "mattress pad" that covered only the top with possibly a light weight material on the side to keep it in place. This product does NOT cover the ENTIRE mattress! It ONLY(like my idea of a pad) covers the top of the mattress. It has some VERY, VERY, FLIMSY (net like) material on the side, with elastic on the edge (nothing to protect the bottom). I can't think it will hold up very well or protect anything but the top. Needless to say, I'm not happy.
