review/text: We have ordered several times from Vitamin Shoppe. Their products are always well packed and arrive quickly. Their prices are consistently lower than others. Taking the combination of Stinging Nettles and Astragalus over a long course of time seems to help with our families alergies. It takes a few weeks to build up in your system, give it that time to notice a difference.
