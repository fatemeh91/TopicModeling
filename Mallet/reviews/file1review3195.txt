review/text: These are one of the best I've tried. A little bit snug, but not uncomfortably so, these are essentially odorless and the latex Crown uses must be some kind of secret recipe, because it just allows more feeling. The lubrication is very light, which we prefer to the goopy mess that some varieties of condoms exhibit. The pink color is fun, too. The price here on Amazon is almost too low to believe--the drugstores and big box stores and convenience marts must be making a killing on rubbers since they are sometims over a dollar each! Great product, cheap enough to try and toss is your opinion is different than mine. Sex is fun--play with it!!
