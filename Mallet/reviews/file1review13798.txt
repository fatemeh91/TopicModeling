review/text: I just received this yesterday and am fairly happy with the product. The shape is ideal for shoulder and neck stiffness, and is also nice for neck support while seated. This is one of the better products I have found. The heat does not last very long, although I find it consistent with other heated product using natural materials. The scent packet is nice, although it may not be everyone's cup of tea (fortunately it's removable).My one complaint is that the chenille cover is already shedding blue fuzz around the seams. I am concerned about it's durability and washability. Overall, I think this is a good product.
