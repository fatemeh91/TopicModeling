review/text: The test was easy enough to use. However, it was messy, as the urine collection pad didn't have a cover on it. You have to place it on the table with the collection pad facing downwards (since the result window is on the other side) and that resulted in a most unhygienic and messy situation with urine on the table. I found that to be the biggest drawback. Also, reading the results wasn't easy; there's a difference between the darkness of the lines, even if you have two lines that would indicate a positive result. I think it's an average product.
