review/text: The IRT 4020 ThermoScan is easy to use on babies, and takes just a second to get a temperature reading, but I am never able to get a consistent temperature. I have tried using the thermometer in the same ear 3 times in a row, and the temperature reading will flux from 98.2-101.1! The only way I know for sure if someone in our household has a temp is if the reading is about 102 and their forehead feels very warm. Having an ear thermometer is nice, but I'd suggest spending a little more money so it can actually serve it's purpose efficiently.
