review/text: I signed up for Subscribe & Save, which cuts the price down to only 15 dollars (for the 2 pound container). I also got free overnight shipping - wonderful! It tastes great. Not to mention that it doesn't have ridiculously high levels of arsenic and mercury - or anything detrimental to your health (unlike some other protein supplements I won't name). Recommended.
