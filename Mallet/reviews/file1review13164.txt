review/text: I bought 6 sheets more than a year ago (I have 3 kids). After so many war time I can say that this product works perfectly:- easy to put in place- easy to change overnight (if a non-expected leak happens)- easy to laundry (after 1 year in wash machines it's still ready for work)It was also a great acquisition for every travel with the kids since it's very acceptable in terms of size/weight.Great product. Go for it with no hesitation
