review/text: These mints have 15mg of caffeine per mint and 75 mints per tin. You can easily get the right amount you need without having to gulp sour energy drinks. You are also very kissable after using them. The only thing that kinda sucks is when you are sucking on them and you get a bitter taste in your mouth because the caffeine wasn't processed well enough and you get bitter little bits in your mouth. However, if you chew them up, you aren't going to experience that. They are amount the smoothest mints you can buy.
