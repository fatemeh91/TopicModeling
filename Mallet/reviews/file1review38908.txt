review/text: Well it looks as if no one has reviewed this product in a LONG time (now that there is the new Gillette Venus razor), so I decided to write a new one for it. This was the first type of razor I ever used, and I still use it several years after I started! Throughout the few years that I've used the SensorExcel razor, it's hardly ever given me cuts, and I rarely get nicks. It does, indeed, leave your legs feeling very smooth and I recommend it to all. However, like most (non-electric) razors, it did (and still does) give me ingrown hairs, especially after I didn't shave all winter. My word of advice is to SHAVE DURING WINTER if you're prone to ingrown hairs. Overall, I highly recommend this razor!
