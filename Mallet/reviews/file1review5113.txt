review/text: I have tried almost all protein drinks out there and based on taste this one is pretty decent. Not the best, but very good and definitely better than most that I have tried. The main reason I tried it was because it doesn't contain Aspartame or Sucralose, both of which which don't agree with me health wise. So, for it to taste good without those artificial sweeteners in it definitely deserves a five star from me. No gas or bloating from this as well which is a nice change from other protein drinks I have used in the past. I also occasionally mix this with Whey Protein Isolate from Now Foods with great results.
