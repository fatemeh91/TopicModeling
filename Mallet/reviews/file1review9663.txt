review/text: We love Hylands products in general and this couph syrup tastes good which makes it easy for your child to take. My child is a preschooler and like most kids, hates even the best flavored medicine and would rather not take medications due to the taste. This product tastes like honey and goes down easy. No fights, no hassle! I would have given it 5 stars except it doesn't last very long for symptom relief so we were using it every 3 hours for a cold/couph but felt safe doing so with the ingredients/homeopathic. My child was glad for the taste, had some relief, but it didn't take his couphs away 100% (which you do not want to do anyway.) Overnight use we had to use other products so he could sleep more than a few hours but daytime it gets him through the day with minimal complaints. Combined with the Hyland cold tablets they also have, I think it reduced his sick time from the general 7 plus days to about 4 days. This isn't a scientific study just an observation. lol. We always prefer to use homeopathic medicines whenever possible and Hylands has been around more than most and has a solid reputation so I would recommend their product. Happy Health to you all!
