review/text: This shaver is excellent dry, ie: the best electric shave I have experienced, close, comfortable, fast. Used wet, however, it leaves vagrant whiskers especially in the neck area. This is true whether you use a preconditioner, foam or gel. I would suggest that you use the tap to just clean the unit and be grateful that you can now keep an electric razor really clean.
