review/text: I started NV on 23 Sept 2012, with the prescribed dosage of 6 pills a day. I, too, was skeptical about the outcome since there are so many products out there that say they'll deliver and then you just end up tossing and turning all night. However, on Sunday the 23rd, I weight myself at 189 pounds. With diet and exercise, as it says on the bottle, I am now ten pounds lighter today on 30 Sept 2012. I'm not a young girl, I'm a 32 year old puerto rican and I'm stunned. This morning I screamed when I looked at the scale. NV has me hooked and I will definitely keep on taking this pill. There are no jitters and I fall fast asleep after my thirty minute workout three times a week. Try it!
