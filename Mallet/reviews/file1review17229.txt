review/text: This appears to be an updated version of a Remington trimmer that served well for many years.After a months use, I can report that the stability of the trim length setting has been improved, and the trimmer blades no longer require lubrication. The quality of the beard trim is also improved, allowing for rapid trimming.If this new trimmer is as durable as my first, I will more that satisfied.
