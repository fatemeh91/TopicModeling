review/text: I recently decided to try this product to increase my mental energy and focus. Boy does it do that! The only problem is, the time-release supposedly kicks in 10 hours later. I noticed myself getting a second wind rather late at night and then being awake until 1:00 a.m. If you want to be up to the wee hours of the morning this is great for you. If you have trouble sleeping, I would not recommend this. I still use it some, but I empty out about a third of the capsule before taking it.Update: The last few times I took this I did not feel as jangley as the first time, even taking the full capsule. So maybe your body adjusts to it with regular use. I still don't take it daily, just once in a while for extra energy.
