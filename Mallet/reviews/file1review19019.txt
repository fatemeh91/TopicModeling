review/text: I've been using Fiber One cereal, and Fiber One bars in order to add fiber to my diet. Unfortunately, they gave me quite a lot of gas that was embarrassing. I decided to try the Benefiber powder in order to cut down on calories. Strangely, it works great and has none of the gas side effects of the cereals and bars!!
