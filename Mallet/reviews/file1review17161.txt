review/text: I bought this trimmer 18 months ago to replace a Norelco that finally died after 10 years. The functions are great for trimming beard and mustache, but after only 18 months, the battery will no longer hold a charge more than a week or two. Nothing quite as delightful as getting halfway through trimming your beard before going to work on Monday morning and having the battery die halfway through! And BTW, it won't work on wall power; you have to wait for it to charge up enough to finish....I'm used to the fact that electronics are so cheap now that they're disposable, but this is insulting. No more Remington for me.
