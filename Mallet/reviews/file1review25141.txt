review/text: This thing is just not good.First, the touch-free part only works if a) the bin is pretty much completely empty and b) the batteries are pretty much brand new. Another words...it rarely ever works.Second, the smell!!!!! Everytime you open it up to throw away a diaper you will be hit with this horrendous smell...and before you think "well, you need to change it more"...her is our routine. We empty it every 3-4 days. We DO NOT throw poopy diapers in it, we take those out to the garbage in the garage. We change the little filter every month like we are supposed to. We use deoderant garbage bags and spray it down with lysol everytime we change it.So...it's not us. It's the diaper pail. Save you money...this is a piece of very smelly junk.Get a diaper dekor...or better yet, just throw your diapers away in your regular garbage. It's cheaper and your LO will enjoy the "field trip"
