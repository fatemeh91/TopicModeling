review/text: No AmmoniaStreak Free ShineNo FumesVinegar PowerThe first time you use this glass cleaner it will remove all the buildup from other cleaners, which will make everything super shiny. The Kosher vinegar in this product has a very mild scent, hardly noticeable.Other fun uses:Can be diluted with equal parts water and used with professional glass cleaning equipment. Can be poured into your car's auto washer reserve unit.If you take this around the house and shine up mirrors, the front of the stove, the toaster, chrome in the bathrooms, the windows, mirrors and the glass on pictures....etc, you will notice your entire house is sparkling. Spring Cleaning has rarely been this much fun. This cleaner and the soy cleanser are delicious products. The soy cleaner has a lime scent and this product has a fresh vinegar scent that reminds me of a mixture my grandma would make up at home to clean the windows.The vinegar is definitely the secret. What you might enjoy most is the mild scent and how you can breathe and clean at the same time! Unlike other overwhelming window cleaners, this is definitely ammonia free. I cleaned houses for years and this window/glass cleaner tops them all. For superior shine, this is one classy glass cleaner.~The Rebecca Review
