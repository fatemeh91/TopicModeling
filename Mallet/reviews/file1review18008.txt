review/text: I have been sensitive to light while sleeping since I was a child. I started using eye masks when I was 13, but they always let light in around the nose and put pressure on my eyes which would cause migraines sometimes. Now that I sleep during the day, I had to find a perfect sleep mask to block out the sunlight that still manages to sneak its way through my thick dark window curtains. This mask is perfect, instead on pressing on the eyes, itcups over the eyes so sleeping feels more natural. There is padding around the edges so it is comfortable and no extra pressure on the face. It also fits well around my nose so light doesnt get sneak in around the nose. Overall it's a great mask and I use it every day.
