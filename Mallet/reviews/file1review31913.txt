review/text: I bought this product for general health purposes. After using it for a short amount of time, I do notice a positive difference (to me this is remarkable because with the exception of laxatives and perhaps a few other supplements, I have never noticed the slightest difference between supplementing for any period of time and not). But the most noticeable improvement is elimination of body odor. Which, to me, is quite amazing! So that is what I will focus on.After brushing your teeth, your breath may still smell bad (or your mouth just not feel fresh) because your body continues producing the bacteria that are responsible for the stench. Using this product greatly lessens (you could almost say removes) all body odors (sweat, bad breath, feces, etc.) due to its anti-bacterial qualities (I suppose it is the clorophyll?). So I suggest trying this product.However, the taste may be intolerable to some. To me, it tastes OK. I have tried mixing it with cranberry/grape juice and it tastes much worse like that! If you don't like it, you may want to try taking them in capsule form (but five capsules is a lot to swallow) or perhaps buy pure clorophyll, which tastes pretty much neutral. I don't know if that would work as well, but I myself plan on trying it. So good luck and I hope this review helps you make a better decision and that you're satisfied with whatever product you choose and the end result.
