review/text: I've assembled my own bug out and survival kits, and this is one extremely value-friendly bundle. The tools aren't top notch, but I easily spent over $150 for my own kit. This has a couple of the core fundamentals that you'd want in a price thats reasonable for the majority of people (my kit's use in the Army requires a lot more).
