review/text: Well I ordered this combo in december 2009 because they were on a promotion with the Canon SX20 IS, and in those time I did not know anything about chargers & batteries so I finished with 2 DPS3000 chargers including 4 batteries each plus 4 aditional 2700 mAh batteries. Let me talk apart about the charger and batteries. The DPS3000 charger, after 3 years of use is yet OK (review edited 3 years later on december 29-2012), the charging time is as advertised some 3 1/2 hours for a set of 4 batteries; it worked well with their own batteries brand as with the 8 Sanyo Eneloop, 8 Ray O Vac Hybrid and 6 Duracell (all 2000 mAh) I should buy later. A good point is you can use it in the house or the car. The Digipower batteries quality is another story, of the 12 batteries I get, the 4 that come alone, lost the charge within 5-8 days just on the begining, so I should throw them away, asking by mail to Digipower, I never had an answer. The second set, that come with a charger, lost the charge in 2-4 days after 18 months of use, and of course I throw away them too. The third set that also come with a charger are the "best" and kept the charge for about a full month just after 24 month of use and I throw away this set too. I use them in a Digital Concepts 952AFC flash and give the longest 9" recovery time expected at full power with recent charged batteries. The Sanyo Eneloop, and another Rayovac Hybrid work totally different, they kept the charge between 3 and 6 month depend the use and work just fine with my camera or flash. In the flash they give 4-5 seconds recovery time and that is a full 50% faster. My conclusion is that the charger is of acceptable quality for the price, but the batteries are almost of very very low quality.
