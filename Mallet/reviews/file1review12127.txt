review/text: Easy to swallow, gentle to digest. No bad after taste. Make my early pregnancy much easier than the 1st one.I took some other prescription vitamin last pregnancy. It worked fine. But it really had a very badafter taste, every morning this bad taste in my mouth made me almost threw up.This time, my doctor recommended this product to me. It's inexpensive. Comes in a big jar.Good quality and well made vitamin. I like it very much
