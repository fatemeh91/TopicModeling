review/text: Up Date I had to order some more Listerine and Good Buy was quick shipping It.I guess I Am content with It If Listerine Never changes, Where does some of these manufactures get the Idea that they need to change the formula without the Customers ever complaining? If the Customers are Not complaining and They are making a profit then They must be doing something right, Coca Cola once thought They needed to change the formula and Their Customers back lashed, Would It Not be nice If Customers Not only done this for Not just the taste of the food but also the quality of the food? Listerine Not only prevents germs but also stops germs, when I get a toothache I hold Listerine In My mouth for a few hours but also Listerine Is one of the least poisonous mouthwash so much that can actually drink small amounts when ever I get salmonella I take around 3 table spoons or a cap full and It seems to work. Do Not do this with other mouthwash because some are very poisonous. Also check out Colloidal Silver also Food Grade 35% Hydrogen Peroxide.
