review/text: We bought two of these to use in a toddlers bed. I think it's hot - my son gets kind of sweaty from sleeping on it, don't think we'll be able to use it during the summer - and it doesn't stay put as well as I hoped it would. With that being said, he doesn't seem to mind either of the above issues, and because I bought two one can go in the wash while the clean one is on the bed and I don't have to wash the sheets and remake the bed several times a week.
