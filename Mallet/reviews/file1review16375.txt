review/text: I bought four of these handles and with minimal use two bulbs blew out and they cost $25 each. The handle is actually quite good for the price and it's slightly brighter than my similar Heine (F-22.804) handles but I could never recommend this Welch Allyn handle because the bulbs don't last. The Heine bulbs last forever. I called Welch Allyn to discuss this and got no response.
