review/text: I love to go barefoot! The moment I enter my humble abode, or anywhere else where bare-feet are tolerated, off come the shoes. It's a little rebellion, I think, from all the wear and tear my feet and legs have had to endure as an RN. Those little pinkies just scream to be free from the confinement of those, very necessary, athletic shoes.Going barefoot has its bad side, though. My feet become very dry and calloused (yep, I can walk on rocks and acorns without flinching), and my heels are prone to cracking. Not a pretty sight! I have tried every remedy out there from, 'Miracle Foot Cream,' to cow udder cream, all to no avail. Some seemed to actually make the situation worse.I was already enjoying Aveeno's Stress Relief formula for overall body moisturizing, becoming increasingly impressed that it actually DID moisturize for 24 hours, as advertised. So, I put it to the ultimate test. I applied it liberally to my feet, put on some light socks, and left them on overnight. I was absolutely astonished at the difference in just one night. My feet were soft, and the cracked heels began to heal. After a few more overnight applications, my feet are almost brand new, for the first time, in years.If this lotion can moisturize neglected feet/heels resulting in this much difference, it is a no-brainer, that it can moisturize the rest of the body with ultimate efficiency. And, while nurturing your skin, you can enjoy the scent of lavender, chamomile and ylang-ylang, all embraced in aromatherapy for their calming, stress reducing, properties.Give it a try! A little goes a long way, and for the results received, the cost is fabulous!
