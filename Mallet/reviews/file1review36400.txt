review/text: I have been pricing mirrors on stands that provide lighting and magnification. It's been difficult to find 10X mirrors and their costs have been too high for me to justify the purchase. After Christmas, I went to Amazon.com to see if I could find one at a more reasonable price than I have seen in retail. I discovered something even better - a hand mirror with 10X magnification at less than 20% of the price of a standing one. I only require magnification that high for a few jobs, so a handheld was a terrific option. Amazon expanded my shopping choices from the comfort of my home.
