review/text: I purchased a conair HR10 Hot Stone Spa 10 years ago and loved it! I still use it with very good results!The hair and nail salon that I go to uses the same hot stone spa with good results. I decided to buy one for my son, because of his complaints of muscle aches. I was sooo disappointed to find that the hot stone spa barely heated to a luke warm. What happened to this product in the last 10 years?
