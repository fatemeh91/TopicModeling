review/text: I may need to use this a few more times before I can give a good review but as of now I'm not impressed with it. It did not clean my dish washer at all. I love in a housing facility though with a very old washer that I'm sure has never been cleaned and we have terrible water, we're not even allowed to drink it. So like I said maybe a few more uses and I can change my review.
