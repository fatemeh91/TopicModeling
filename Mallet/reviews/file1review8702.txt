review/text: I'm one of those people who can never bring themselves to fill a sink with water and soap and do dishes. It always seems like too much of a commitment. Especially if you just have a couple of pans to wash. I just want to grab a scrubber and a dish and go at it.Obviously, something with soap built in is a big plus, and I used to use those soap dispensers with a sponge on the end. The problem with those was that the soap would either leak out faster than I want, or not at all. And if you aren't careful with the sponge, it gets all mildewey and nasty. And inevitably the sponge gets nasty from cleaning anything particularly nasty, and also inevitably falls apart at some point, and finding the right replacement sponge head is always a challenge.This brush is PERFECT! It ROCKS! You can control exactly how much soap you use, and the brush is great at scrubbing off hardened, baked on stuff, and it never gets dirty at all, no matter how nasty the thing you are cleaning is, because NOTHING sticks to the brush at all. I've been using the brush for months now and it still looks brand new.I'm sure that eventually the brush will start to get all bent and mashed, so my biggest fear is that they will stop making this brush, and I'll have to go back to those inferior sponge ones. So, that is why I'm writing this review to encourage everyone to buy one of these brushes, so they don't ever stop making them!You won't be disappointed, trust me!
