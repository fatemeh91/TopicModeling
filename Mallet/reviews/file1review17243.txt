review/text: Disclaimer: I only have a patch of hair on my chin that I shave twice a week... so there is minimal use and I don't have overly think hair. That being said, I have not had any issues with this as of yet. The guard (length setting) works great and has not slipped at all. I don't believe that I'm pushing hard against the guard, and so maybe with a lot of pressure it would slip, though with normal use I haven't had ANY issues yet. Additionally, I have not had this long enough to evaluate the battery, but since I'm always next to a outlet and only using it for 3-5 minutes at a time it is not something I'm overly concerned with.All in all, this works great for my purposes: short shaves on a small area of the face about 2x/wk.
