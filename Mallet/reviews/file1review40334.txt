review/text: Gaia Herbs Quick Defense, 20 capsule is a one dose option to avoid cold's and flu's by boosting the immune system. The main ingredients are Echinacea and Elderberry.In Late Winter, early spring I run into allergy issues. At the same time, cold and flu season are in full force. I can easily tell when allergies are affecting me, but it can be difficult for me to tell when the symptoms are cold and flu. For allergies I use Respir-All. When I get an itchy throat I gargle hot sauce. I have put other things in play as well. Recently when a runny nose hit me which was different than with allergies I started taking the Quick Defense. It's been 3 days after and I am still well. I am still dealing with allergy symptoms which I am fighting successfuly as well.I have many things I do in my cold and flu "toolbox" that are cheaper than the Quick Defense. Though I believe it is effective, $17 for one dose is a little too pricey for me when I have other things available that work. If you have yet to find anything for you, this may be worth a try.A word of advice: Always take the full dose. I have found with herbs if you try to take less sometimes it will fail to work at all.
