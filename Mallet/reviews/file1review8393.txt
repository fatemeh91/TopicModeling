review/text: I understand that most reviews on here are not reviewing it for baby bottles, but it worked great for me. I was looking for one that would easily navigate the narrow bottle necks, but also be able to clean the narrow tubes of my breast pump equipment. This did great! I was able to clean my Madella breast pump much better than with my original munchkin brush. I found several others at the local grocery store, but their bristles were either too short to make their way all the way to the tip of the bottle nipple, or their necks were too thick so they couldn't navigate the pump equipment, or the bristles were so scratchy they would damage the plastic of the bottle causing more issues with build up/residue/decreased visibility and left me unsure if they were "clean" necessitating more bottles. This brush hasn't given me any headaches yet. Thrilled. Given how often I use it I'd love it it had a "cap" of some sort so I knew nothing got on it while we were rinsing adult food in the sink, but &lt;shrugs> that's pretty minor. We have yet to see if it holds up to the regular sanitizing steam baths we submitted the other one to. So far so good though!
