review/text: My only concern is you sources. There are over 15o different types of the Lapacho tree in the Amazon jungle, which this product comes from. However, of all these different types, only 2 of them are real effective. One of them lives in the higher elevation, while the other lives in the lower elevation. One has purple flowers, one has yellow flowers, which both eat insects. So, how can I know that you are using the inner bark from the right trees?
