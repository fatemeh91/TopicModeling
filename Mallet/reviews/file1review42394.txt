review/text: Of the many rub and roll ons that I've tried, MRM Joint Synergy + is by far the very best and it doesn't smell so offensively as many other products do. I recommend this product because it really does the job! My trigger finger catches like the joint is defective, but when I apply MRM Joint Synergy, the catch goes away and my trigger finger feels great again.
