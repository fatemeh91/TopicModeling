review/text: I ordered on Wednesday, was delivered to me on Friday (that was with the free shipping too!)I've been using Sonicare brushes for about two years now, and will never go back. The brushes are more expensive, but it's well worth it. My teeth feel much cleaner, and are whiter.Great service from Amazon.
