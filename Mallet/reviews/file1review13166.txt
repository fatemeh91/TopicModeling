review/text: If you are parent to a child who isn't trained to wake up in the middle of the night and pee in the toilet, this will probably be a life-saver. The size is large enough to cover the sleeping area of my large 3-yr-old son (he's about the height of a 5 yr-old). My son wees in his sleep, and sometimes the diapers leak, so this has saved a lot of laundry for me. It protects the mattress, and it's much more manageable to launder than all the bed sheets.
