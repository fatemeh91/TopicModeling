review/text: We purchased this for my father in law who has a huge stomach hernia and is unable to have surgery. A regular hernia belt would not work with his bad back so we thought we would try this because of the straps and it works great!!!! I would highly recommend this to any pregnant person as well as anyone with our type of problem!!!
