review/text: It really is "instantized" as the label says. You needn't a blender, hand mixer, nada. A spoon will do fine. The taste is more neutral then anything approaching delicious, and that's a good thing. I mix it with 6 ounces of water and its perfect. Mild but real chocolate taste, it probably taste even better with milk. But as it is its lite, thin, easy to drink, and completely inoffensive. It's not thick like other powders and leaves no sticky protein sludge at the bottom of the glass or elsewhere. Plus it has little if no vitamin taste. Or whatever that terrible protein taste is in other mixes.I have never liked protein drinks / shakes. Hate them as a matter of fact. But I can honestly say I don't mind this at all. I actually like it pretty good. And since you can mix a whole scoop with just a little fluid and a spoon it makes it all the more easier to take.
