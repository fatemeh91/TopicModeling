review/text: The first time I received this item, the box was somewhat torn because the aerosol cans were loosely packed. The second order came in a much smaller package, but the cardboard was paper thin. The package bottomed out after I started to walk it back from the post office, so just be wary.But hey, the aerosol smelled nice and even lasted relatively long. I've recently switched to a solid freshener, because the aerosol sometimes only mixes with bad odors instead of eliminating them. I also have asthma so I think the solid freshener is the better option.
