review/text: I cannot recommend the quality of this heat highly enough. It's a convenient way to get moist heat into the muscles, and the size of this pad (14x27) covers the entire back and hips. There is no temperature adjustment. The pad is either on or off, and is designed for short heat treatments. Therefore, it has a switch you actually hold to keep it on. The 170 degree heat is far hotter than other heating pads, however, meaning you only need the heat treatment for a short duration to receive the benefits. I use this heating pad in my massage therapy office, and I highly recommend it for home use as well.
