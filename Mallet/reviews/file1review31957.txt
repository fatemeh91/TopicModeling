review/text: First of all, I am a skeptic and I was addicted to caffeine and ephedra for many years because I felt incredible energy and it's something that actually worked right away. I weaned myself off of both stimulants and it took a long time to get my natural energy back. Plus caffeine used to make me agitated. I happened to buy these greens because I heard it helps with infertility. I did not get pregnant so I gave up on it. I recently went on weight watchers and teach many fitnesses classes per week(yes I still gain wt unfortunately with age) and I started taking vitamins. I saw the green food in my closet and decided to add it in every other day. I could not believe how much energy I received about 30-60 minutes after from the greens as opposed to not feeling anything from my multi vitamin!!! When at the gym I work out like a beast with incredible strength! I am stuck on this for life, b/c I hate feeling tired, and hopefully it will help me get pregnant. This stuff if powerful and is the bomb! I am so happy I decided to try it again and realized my energy increase with it!
