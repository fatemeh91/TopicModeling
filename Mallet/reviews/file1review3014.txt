review/text: Both my girlfriend and I felt that these were fairly good condoms, esp. considering the price (about 16.5 cents each). They aren't as sensitive, for either of us, as other condoms we have used. We've been using Lifestyles ULTRA THIN condoms for several years now, after a lot of trial and error (tough job), and nothing compares. Plus, you can get the Lifestyles for about 12 cents each.
