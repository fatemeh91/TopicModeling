review/text: I purchased this item to use during the night for my young son who sometimes wets the bed while he is sleeping (I refused to keep buying Pull-Ups). The size of the pad is very generous and it stays in place well. The pad also washes and dries very well. It has already paid for itself and has been a lifesaver for me; I am considering purchasing a second one. This pad protects the bottom sheet efficiently, however, occasionally the top sheet or comforter gets a little saturated depending on my son's position. I am not sure why there is a package label stating that it is not for use with children as it does not give a reason. Overall, I would recommend this product.
