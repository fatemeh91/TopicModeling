review/text: I purchased this about a year ago and mainly bought it because I was going on a cruise for my anniversary and really didn't want to be shaving everyday before I put on a swimsuit. I read many reviews and thought this would be the best option. These are my thoughts and opinions on its performance.The pain is tolerable. The intial hair pull it the worst of them all. After a few seconds, I became comfortable and did not notice much discomfort or an increase in pain...until the start of the next leg and then it starts all over again briefly. My tolerance for pain is pretty high and I have waxed my legs before. I think waxing might be more painful because it pulls on the skin, too.The removal of hair is okay. Not what I was expecting based on the reviews I had read. I have fine, blonde hair on my legs and about 50% of the hairs were pulled out and the remaining 50% were broken off close to the skin. To get a smooth shave I have to use the shaving attachment or a regular razor. It does work better on thicker, more coarse hair. I used it on my bikini line and did not have any problems with hair removal...and yes, the pain does greatly increase in that area.The process is very time consuming because you have to go slowly or you miss several hairs or they snap off instead of pulling them out.The increase in ingrown hairs is great but understandable. You must scrub and exfoliate daily while in the shower or bath to avoid that problem.Overall, I would not buy this product again but, I still use it periodically to minimize the amount of regular shaving I have to do while in the shower.
