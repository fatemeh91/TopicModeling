review/text: My experience trying the chocolate flavored Balance Bars was one I don't care to repeat! I followed the instructions on the package to drink a glass of water with the bar and the water was the only way I could swallow it! The taste of the bar was very chalky and dry and truthfully, the thing almost made me gag! In all fairness to the product, it did keep its promise to satisfy my hunger and sustain my energy, but unless they can find a way to improve the flavor, I'll never touch another one! If you can stomach the taste and texture, than it may work for you, but I don't recommend this particular flavor of Balance Bars. Perhaps another flavor would be better.
