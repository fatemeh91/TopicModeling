review/text: This tea is good. Its the first hibiscus tea I have had, I think. It has enough tartness and enough sweetness that it is very satisfying. Some people might not need any sweetener. I put just under a teaspoon of agave nectar and its perfect. (agave nectar is a low glycemic sweetener found in the natural foods section of your grocery). I recommend this tea.
