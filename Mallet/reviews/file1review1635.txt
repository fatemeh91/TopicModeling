review/text: I like the clean applicator of this medication, rather than the gels/liquids which tend to get gunky quickly. The only drawback is that it appears like a lip balm, so you'll want to keep it kept away safely for young ones and make mention to others who don't look closely at labels. I also like that the percentage of the active ingredient is much higher than other brands. We've only been using it a five days and we're quickly seeing the efficacy of this product.
