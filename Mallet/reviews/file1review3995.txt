review/text: The good news with this razor is that the single blade on the reverse makes a neat job of sideburns and mustache area for men. Unfortunately, this is the only improvement over the Mach3. It also delivers an inferior shave compared to its predecessors.Despite the introduction of the Phantom version, which gives men a more palatable black over the original orange, the shave it gives is still an inferior one.
