review/text: while it holds the bottle ok, it does NOT hold the needle in place! it has an open channel that helps guide the needle into the bottle but then you've got to hold the needle in place, turn the guide over and still draw the insulin while trying to hold the syringe in the channel. results: bent needle tips as syringe falls out of channel groove; hard to hold needle in place and draw insulin at same time. not worth the effort or price at all.
