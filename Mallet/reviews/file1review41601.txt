review/text: At first the toothbrush feels a little odd but it works very well. My teeth feel and look much cleaner and whiter. I don't have any issues with the functioning of the toothbrush and I think the timer function is helping me brush for the recommended length of time. I am so pleased with this product I'm going to buy one for another family member.
