review/text: Bought these at the suggestion of my mom for my 3 kids. Mom's know best... with her guidance of how to fold for boys and how to fold for girls to acquire maximum use for absorbancy, these diapers were a hit. And for nighttime use, just double up the diapers to 2 or 3 or just simply use a disposable. These are perfect for the over-the-shoulder burp cloths too. After baby toilet trains and is out of these, you wont find anything better when you need a soft polishing cloth. Now I'm buying at least 8 dozen for my daughter's first baby due in January. :) Andi
