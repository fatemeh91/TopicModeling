review/text: This is a full-size shaver with double foils and an effective push-up trimmer which is a sort of marvel for the meager price of $16.If you're looking for the closest electric shave on the market, this is probably it. It REALLY is as close as a blade. It shaves closer than my high-end Braun Series7, Panasonic ES-LA63 and everything else I've tried. Too good to be true? Yes, because it comes at the expense of a very rough effect on your face. If you have anything close to sensitive skin, stay away--it will be very irritating. On the other hand, if your skin is very hardy or leathery, this may very well be the shaver for you. My skin is somewhat sensitive so the Shave Pro has been relegated to my shaver graveyard drawer.For those reasons I give it 5 stars for closeness and 1 star for comfort, averaging out at three.I should mention that this is a wet/dry shaver and I only tried it dry. It is totally possible that some shave cream or gel used in a wet shave could take the edge off the roughness issue, but I don't know. If so, you'd really hit a home run.The shaver has good looks and ergonomics, feels good in the hand and is decently maneuverable.So, if you think your face can handle a shaver that feels a little like sandpaper, go ahead and try it. You may love it!
