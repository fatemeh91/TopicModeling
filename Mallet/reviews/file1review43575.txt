review/text: My doctor told me that I should keep a check on my blood pressure. The suggestion was to go to the pharmacy and use their machine once in while for a few months. I decided to purchase my own Omron monitor. It is very convenient being able to do it at a specific time each day. I found it easy to use and I liked the fact that it kept track of 60 readings and also produced an average.I hope that with this device I will be able to be sure that if I need medication at some point I will not let time go by without proper treatment. High blood pressure is called the silent killer because there are no symptoms until it is usually much too late.
