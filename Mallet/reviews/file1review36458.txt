review/text: MD recommended the AREDS formulation as my eyes began showing age-related degradation. Use has improved tearing. The Bausch and Lomb formulation matches well with that recommended by the medical schools that did the original research, and Amazon delivered product well within the sell-by date. The price was significantly lower than available in my local marketplaces.
