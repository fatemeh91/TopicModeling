review/text: I have been using sensor shaver since I was in high school, when they first came out thirty years ago or so. It's getting harder to find the razors for it. I knew amazon would have them. It's a great razor. I don't think we need five blades on a cartridge. After two or three blades it is pointless & the prices are outrageous.
