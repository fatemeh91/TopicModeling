review/text: I really liked this product a lot. They work great for keeping the nose from becoming sore and they're really strong as well. The Cold Care Ultra product is even better than the lotion type. It worked just as well to prevent my nose from getting sore. And you don't have to worry if you used them on the fly to wipe your glasses clean. Definitely switching to these. I give them a high 5 stars.
