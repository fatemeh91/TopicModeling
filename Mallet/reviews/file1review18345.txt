review/text: I have eczema on the palm of my hand and thumb as well as as painful cracked heels. I use this 2-3 times a day and it really helps. It doesn't cure it, of course, but it dramatically reduces the scaling and dryness. My skin hasn't cracked and bleed since I started using it a month ago. This brand has lanolin in it, which works very well, but has the lanolin odor. I use this on my feet and another brand of urea cream on my hands. No perfume too. The price is reasonable and delivery was prompt.
