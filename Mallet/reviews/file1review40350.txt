review/text: I tried this when I felt one of my headaches coming on. I woke up feeling miserable and stuffy, along with the headache. Before long, I was sneezing too. I took the first dose at about 7 am, then another dose at around 11. My headache was gone by noon and I was no longer stuffy. I took another two doses that day, but didn't have any more symptoms, so I decided to save them and see if I get the same results next time I feel bad.I'm not sure if I was getting a cold or had allergies, but the product did seem to help. When I have these headaches, they usually last a full day, sometimes two and I have to take OTC migraine medicine to make them go away.
