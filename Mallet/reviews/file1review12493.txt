review/text: I am disappointed with this product after reading all the great reviews. I followed the directions to the letter, including taking fresh lemon juice to aid the reaction, etc. As the directions state, taking 2 more each night until reaching 3-5 bowel movements the next day. I am up to taking 16 pills, and have yet to have more than 2 BMs the following day, and have lost at most 1, maybe 2 lbs that I can directly attribute to this product, going from 245 to about 243. My stomach/intestines/bowels do make some noise, and true to form, my BMs are liquified. Word of warning...if you try this stuff and you feel the need to pass gas, do so at the very high risk of it not being just gas. Disgusting, I know, but I'm just being honest and trying to let you know what you are getting in to here.I would have given one star, but since it did seem to help a little, I gave 2 stars.As far as the shipping...I think I had the product 2-3 days after ordering, so no complaint there.
