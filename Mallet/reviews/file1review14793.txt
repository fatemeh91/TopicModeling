review/text: First, a big thank you to Amazon for providing this forum. I am grateful for this.Bought this without looking to make sure it was gmo free. Bought NOW gmo-free lecithin--EXCELLENT product.(had to request that the Co-op store order gmo-free lecithin) Bought NOW gmo-free xylitol and have just re-ordered. Great product. Not only is this powder not gmo-free, it seems to be "hiding gmo content" because it is a calcium-mg. supp. It has a surprise-- soy-derivative on the label. The supp. is not listed in NOW'S "COMPLETE LIST OF GMO-FREE PRODUCTS" on NOW's website. It has this dorky rating from some rating organization, which they proudly display. Its a "GMP" seal (not finding a gmo free indication saying otherwise, I thought it was for "genetically modified product" at first when it got here). I forgot to include this product with my other order I made the same evening, paying by mistake for standard shipping. This product is going back in the mail, still sealed. The soy or its possible infusion with herbicide may be why some are having problems with loose stools. The rest of the formula for this powder is "to die for", I think. I'm a 66 old lady (ha ha), still trying to exercise regularly, and have felt that mg. in the past has helped leg pain after. Now I need calcium also to combat a tired back, and hoped to get everything I need in a powder. Think again. Already have large capsules (triple OOO's)if it won't dissolve. Really thought that it would NOT be gmo, like so many other of their great products. Wouldn't be so grumpy---if we were not trying to volunteer to get the labeling initiative passed here in the golden state so gave it 2 for trying, and because it was bargain priced, instead of 1 star--LOL (No bargain)
