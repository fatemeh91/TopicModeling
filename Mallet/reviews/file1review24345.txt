review/text: I am allergic to coconut and this is one of very few shampoos that does not contain cocoamide or other coconut products - so although I'm no toddler this is what I use.This is a good mild shampoo that leaves hair shiny without being weighed down. This product is not a moisturizing shampoo, so I regularly use additional pre/post-shampoo conditioning products for my long hair. As with most shampoos scalp build-up does occur over time [depending on skin chemistry, climate & time of year]: adults using this product should occasionally use a scalp-cleansing shampoo.This product is also great for travel - I use it for everything from washing my hair and body to doing light laundry by hand.
