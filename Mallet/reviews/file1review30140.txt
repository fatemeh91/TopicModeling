review/text: These used to be the best ever. Sometimes I could use a strip for several days. Then they changed, although the company denies they changed anything.Strips are made of a gauze like material covered with a coating that when moistened by your saliva adheres to your dental plate and molds to your gums. The last couple of years the gauze material seems thinner and the coating is thicker. This results in there being too much gooey stuff on a thinner gauze strip and the strip slides off your dental plate after a few hours. The result is it becomes a gooey mess.I called the company and they deny any change but that's not so! Recently I ran across a package I had in an old bag and they are the old ones and they are the best ever! But when they're gone I guess that's it - back to the slipy slidy stuff.I compared the old strips to the new ones and that's how I figured out just what changed. Too much gooey and not enough gauze in the strips. What a pity that they managed to mess them up because they used to be the BEST!
