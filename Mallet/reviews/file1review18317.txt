review/text: I was first introduced to the Elemis product line while on a cruise and I've been using Elemis Aching Muscle Super Soak ever since. It is pricey, but well worth the money when muscle and/or joint pain flair. I love this little godsend, especially after a hard day, in the middle of the night, or anytime the aching starts.
