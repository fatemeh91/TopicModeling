review/text: I expected more from this with having many good reviews and it's claims of being of choice, but after taking this I've realize what a waste of money I've spent. The taste is the worst. I wouldn't dare recommend this to anyone. Has a really bad after taste that leaves you feeling weak and nauseated. And that's not even the half of the problem with this supplement. Right after I take this, I would say with in like ten minutes I'm having problem with my stomach. Quite frankly this product is a gimmic and should be banned. I would recommend to those looking for a protein supplement to look into EAS or Weider.
