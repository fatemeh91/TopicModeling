review/text: I just wanted to round out a my supplement plan by adding good greens to a my multi-vitamin and protein powder shake regimen. I chose this product because the ingredient list is impressive. Price seems very reasonable considering what buying all this fresh produce would cost, not to mention preparation and waste. Yes of course the dry product is very green and smells like dried grass or hay clippings as one would expect with no artificial flavorings added. Starting with cold filtered water, I added it to a vanilla cream flavored time release blended protein powder, along with dry oatmeal, walnuts, fiber (psyllium husk), a dash of olive oil, about two tablespoons of low carb strawberry yogurt or a piece of banana and it was still very green but tolerable and obviously a more complete meal replacement shake. One could add lots of calories with other options and possibly make it delicious but this stuff will likely stay green colored, but so is a nice salad or spinach, and we usually flavor those too, huh! I find it more easily digested than a ordinary vegetable meal. And, maybe its all in the head but I do seem to feel better as opposed to when I have had the shakes for quiet some time without the greens added. So far I would recommend the product if you understand what you are getting.
