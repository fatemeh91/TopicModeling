review/text: This is a great little pill pack. It would be nice if each side opened separately. I think it might be harder for older folks to get one side at a time, ( it is for me and I'm 59. Someone with a whole skew of pills twice a day can get them mixed up easily. Also the 7-day tray is very fragile, the slightest bump and all of the days fall off. You have to have it on a sturdy surace and somewhere that you don't have to move it around. But, it's a great idea.
