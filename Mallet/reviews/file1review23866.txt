review/text: I'm a bit picky about the antiperspirant I use, and have tried a bunch of them. Degree is the best I've found.This stuff keeps me from sweating, smells great, goes on easy, and doesn't seem to flake much. My girlfriend forbids me from switching to another product because she likes the way this smells.I'm withholding one star because the design does seem to have one flaw: when you get near the end but still have some left (perhaps less than 1/4 inch or so), the remaining deodorant has a tendency to break off and spew little shards of deodorant all over your bathroom floor! Now I just throw it away even when I still have a little left; I don't like wasting what could be another 2-3 days of deodorant, but it beats cleaning up a mess. I really do wish the company would address this issue.Despite that design issue, this is still the best antiperspirant I've found.
