review/text: I've been using Sparkle for the last 35 years - for windsheilds and other curved glass surfaces (where you can't use a squeege) nothing compares to it. Sparkle is rather expensive (when you can find it) so this was an inexpensive way to refill my spray bottles. Shipping was only $5 for 4 gallons.
