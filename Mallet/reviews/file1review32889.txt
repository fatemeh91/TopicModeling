review/text: I bought this tea last week and have used it for 3 nights now. I am not normally a tea drinker, and don't enjoy very hot liquids, so I used not so hot water and steeped only for a few minutes. I really enjoy the flavor. It takes around 10 - 12 hours for me, and then it kicks in and really works - a little too much; I had a small accident in my underwear twice at work! No bloating or cramping though. I am vegetarian and don't normally need a stimulant but I am trying a bit of a cleanse. I am definitely only going to use this up to a week, the recommended length; it's pretty powerful.
