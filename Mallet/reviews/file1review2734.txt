review/text: After purchasing various types of candles for almost twenty years, I discovered Beanpod candles at a local gift store. Now they are the only candles I will buy. The fragrance is wonderful and they burn better than any other candle I've ever had. They don't leave the ugly wax ledges along the inside of the jar. The fragrance I prefer is lavender.
