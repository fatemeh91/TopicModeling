review/text: Gaia's "Quick Defense" is an interesting product. Gaia has a reputation for quality so I'm not surprised at the other reviewers positive experiences (I haven't been ill for six years so I can't give a first hand opinion).Many magazines or other health information "sources" may advise Echinacea to help boost the immune system, but they leave it very vague, no real dosage recommendations, no usage instructions. Gaia's product on the other hand is quite clear, they advise you to take two capsules, five times per day (that's a total of ten capsules per day) for one or two days when you feel ill. This is not a "daily" preventative supplement.The box claims each dosage of two capsules is the equivalent of 5,200 mg of "dry herb". In simple terms, this is *far* more potent than most products you'd buy off the internet or from your local health foods store.I should also point out this product includes an unspecified amount of Black Elderberry, which among natural medicine doctors is considered to be quite potent and effective in helping the immune system.This is a great product. In most situations it is certainly significantly better than going to your local conventional doctor for a toxic dosage of antibiotics.
