review/text: While the number of blades increases, I am unsure if the shave is any better since the dual blade design.... I still get a shadow by midday (my stubble is very light compared to some!). The best is still the man with the cut-throat... but who can trust a man wielding a cut-throat??I will say that with the extra blades I s1eem to have lower frequency of shaving cuts and the process is less arduous - effectivity of the shave process is slightly increased...What does surprise me is that the cost of the blades is not reducing, are we paying for technology with no return Mr Gillette??????????
