review/text: I tried Vanilla Ice Cream and the value for the price is great, it is far less expensive here than other retailers and its a decent product but the taste is horrible. I normally can drink it with water but it tastes like chalk, so i have to mix it with milk just to choke it down. This is the first Opt. nutrition protein i have tried so next time i will try a different flavor.
