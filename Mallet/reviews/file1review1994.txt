review/text: My daughter made a huge mess and I hated washing up those bibs after every meal. I brought bibsters the first time they were out and have been using ever since.I have some in my diaper bag. A few in the car(just in case)....One thing though the velcro does not stay on well.BUT LOVE THE BIBS ....oh yeah I put them on when I give my baby juice to drink... that cute pocket catches every little drop of liquid.
