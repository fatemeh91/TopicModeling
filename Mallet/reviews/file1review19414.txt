review/text: So far not good. Two live-traps baited with chocolate and peanut butter and kitty food have not been successful in catching our mice so I broke down and bought this product. Plugged it in the kitchen and found it emits unpleasant AUDIBLE (yes, heard by humans) high pitched noise which gave two people in our apartment a headache. So, I installed it in my room as it didn't bother me as much and a second similar product in the kitchen pantry that is just EMF-based repeller (and w/ no sound non-headache producing). Several weeks have passed but we still have mouse sightings and found mouse droppings all over the floor in one room. Product promised results in 2-3 weeks.The air-ionizing and nightlight f(n)s seem to work just fine, but I bought this to chase away rodents.Disappointed, housemate has lost patience with non-violent approach is calling for kill-traps. :(
