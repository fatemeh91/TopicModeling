review/text: You probably won't read this until too late BUT...Consider getting headphones from a manufacturer who isn't going to take you to the cleaners with replacement batteries.These don't hold much of a charge (2ish hours max) and they won't last long (maybe a year?). The real kicker is $20+ for a couple of hearing aid batteries in a goofy proprietary case? OUCH!I like(d) my Sennheiser headphones. Now they sit useless gathering dust. I'll ebay the headphones before I give Sennheiser any more of my money.
