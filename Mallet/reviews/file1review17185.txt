review/text: This trimmer is good for one thing, and one thing only: trimming your beard. The blade is wider than theWahl 9918-6171 Groomsman Beard and Mustache Trimmer, which is both good and bad. It is a little quicker to trim with, but not as maneuverable. The built-in guard is great; no more rooting around in a drawer looking for attachments.The only think I don't like about it, as a beard trimmer, is the handle shape. It has a weird bend that makes it awkward to hold in some positions (mostly when doing my neck, but also the offhand side of my face).Don't think about using it for anything else, though. The blade is too wide to trim your mustache. Or your ears. I tried several times to use it without the guard, always with bloody results.I'm getting the smaller Wahl to use in conjunction with this. Neither one is perfect, but together they cover my needs pretty well.
