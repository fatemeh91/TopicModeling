review/text: I have a lot of trouble sleeping with even the tiniest amount of light, so I use an eye mask every single night. The Bucky mask is indeed ultralight, and I liked how the eye cups were molded so the mask wasn't laying completely against my face, since that tends to make me sweat sometimes.Unfortunately though, after only 2-3 months, the black fabric lining the inside started to peel completely away from the edges. I kept using it for a while, but now it's barely hanging on around the nose. I had to stop using it, and now I'll be looking to try a different brand. Too bad :(
