review/text: I have a few very expensive pairs of sunglasses (won't buy expensive ones ever again) and this kit was exactly what I needed to tighten the screws that are constantly coming loose or falling out. Everytime I needed a repair it was $5-$10 but with this kit, I do it myself and that was worth the money!
