review/text: I have used this product for years, as a matter of fact I bought two so I can always have one ready. I keep it in the freezer and use it to provide comfort at night. Every night, I get in bed and then ask my husband to "go get the thing". I also use when I get migraines. Don't get me wrong, this won't cure a true migraine - likely need some real medicine - but it provides a great deal of comfort while I am waiting for the drugs to work. It is just the right weight to provide some relief when placed over eyes. I highly recommend this product.
