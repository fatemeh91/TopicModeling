review/text: I bought this for myself for a yeast issue I'm having, I don't have digestive problems. Seems to be helping along with a yeast cleansing product I'm using. For the past two years when I eat or put something on my body that doesn't agree with me, my body reacts with a yeast infection. That's why I started this probiotic to help balance the yeast in my system. I'm also staying away from sweets/sugar which is a contributing factor for yeast problems. With continued use, I have no doubt that in time this will help balance the yeast in my body without resorting to prescription rx's. (2 caps daily)P.S my husband is also satisfied with this product for his digestive issues. It has helped him become &#34;regular&#34;. (1 caps daily)
