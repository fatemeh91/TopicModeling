review/text: This product is a very thin piece of plastic that has an adhesive backing. Because it does have an adhesive backing, it is impossilbe to get rid of the hundreds of pin drops or larger size air pockets by squeezing the bubbles out since they are trapped by the adhesive surrounding them and if you accidently touch the adhesive side you have a fingerprint mark,and any small lint gets trapped and impossible to remove. There is no way to move the air pockets to the edge. An ill conceive concept. Oh, by the way made in China.
