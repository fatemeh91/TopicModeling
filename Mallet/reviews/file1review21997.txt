review/text: I have used this product for years. Even though my kids don't get sick often, this product is a must. It has a long shelf life. My two boys don't ever make a fuss about having to take this. I love that it has vitamin C in it to help as well. It says to dissolve under the tongue, but for little ones it will still work if they don't keep it under their tongue
