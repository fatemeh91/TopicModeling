review/text: I am very satisfied with this Happy Wrap.It doesn't create adhesive problems for my skin. I have repetitive stress injuries from the work I do and moist heat is the only thing besides massage that helps relieve the strain. Couldn't be happier unless they made a vest that worked just like it so I could cover more territory at once!
