review/text: After spending almost $40 on ONE OZ of this stuff at the vet, and running out shortly thereafter, I purchased this on amazon. Such a wonderful product. It's basically the same stuff that the vet sells and it worked just as well at clearing up my dog's hot spots. She has even developed additional hot spots since the original one that preceded this purchase and no trip to the vet was necessary because only a couple applications of this powder healed them right up.
