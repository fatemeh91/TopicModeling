review/text: I am a 58 y/o female and started on Cholestene x1 year ago. It was recommended by my cardiologist and the results have been great. I could not tolerate the statins. My total cholesterol started out at 254 and LDL 145,and now is 139, LDL 66. I have made some diet modifications and have increased my exercise by walking 4-5 times a week for 30+ minutes. I have had no side effects. I am currently taking 2 caps in the am and 2 caps in the pm. I am very pleased with my results. Healthy Origins HPF Cholestene Red Yeast Rice -- 120 Capsules
