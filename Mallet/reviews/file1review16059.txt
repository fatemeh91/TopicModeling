review/text: I have used this salve for burns, paper cuts, and other boo-boos, and it is excellent. But the latest, greatest thrill that I have for this product is that it kills a cold sore--quickly. I just returned from a trip to Hawaii, where much to my dismay, I could feel the tell tale blister pop up. Hours later when I returned to my room, I saw it in my bag and decided to give it a try. In the past, I've always used Burt's Bees lip balm but they no longer put comfrey in it, so I don't use it anymore--it's just not the same without the comfrey. I remembered that Ed's salve has comfrey in it so even though it's not really a lip balm, I figured it would work as such. It's very thick and doesn't taste or even feel particularly nice, but I slathered it on thick and kept reapplying as needed, which didn't seem like very often. It's so thick and weighty that if it's applied at bedtime, there will still be a significant amount left in the morning. The good news and the end of this story is that the cold sore was born on a Friday and nearly dead--two days later--by Sunday. Burt's never worked that well. I think the calendula and plantain plays a crucial role as well as the comfrey. Truly amazing, this Ed!
