review/text: I bought this whey because it was a bit cheaper than the other ones. Never had it before now.I have mixed this flavor with water a few times and it tastes pretty nasty. (I have always mixed all my whey with water in the past)Though it's a pain, if you mix a little vanilla ice cream, then put a splash of milk, then the whey and blend/mix it up, it tastes pretty decent.I'm assuming its as effective in promoting rebuild of muscle fibers as any of the other gold standard whey flavors.Wouldn't buy it again because of the taste though.
