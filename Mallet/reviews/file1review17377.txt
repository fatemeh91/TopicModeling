review/text: The color is a little different now, but I have had this (otherwise)same trimmer for 5 years. The battery finally stopped holding a charge a couple of days ago-but I am still using it with the cord plugged in. I haven't been careful charging it at all, so 5 years is probably pretty good. Especially for the price...It trims to a consistent adjustable height, and by removing the adjustable comb it is a very good detail trimmer for the sideburns and beard edges. When I have been lazy for a few days, I use it to to do a "pre-shave" so I don't trash my razor. You don't need to spend more money, this will do the job just fine.
