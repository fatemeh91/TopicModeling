review/text: I took the Rainbow Light Complete prenatal vitamins for most of my pregnancy, but at 8 1/2 months decided I could switch from a 6-a-day vitamin to a 1-a-day vitamin. I had a completely uneventful pregnancy with no morning sickness and attribute that to good luck and the Rainbow Light formula. I've been on this one-a-day for a couple weeks and have no complaints. I have not experienced any aftertaste whatsoever, so I really have no idea what the other reviewers could be talking about. As for the size - I looked at many different prenatal vitamins and they all look huge. I haven't had a problem swallowing them, maybe it's from all the practice with the 6-a-day formula (which were smaller, but I gagged on constantly). They do not upset my stomach and appear to be a good formula - although I didn't research brands. I switched to this one-a-day because I had been using the different Rainbow Light formula with no problems.
