review/text: While I have previously reviewed Synth-6 and loved it, that was when I was first trying out different types of protein drinks. I must say after doing much research and speaking with a few physical trainers, ON seems to be the best for packing on muscle. It is lower in calories than a lot of others and includes glutamine and a lot of BCAA's which is very essential if you are hitting the gym hard. I'm on my third bottle now. The taste isn't nearly as good as synth-6 or muscle milk. But the protein, glutamine, and BCAA's that you are receiving with each scoop are well worth it! I'd highly recommend this product.
