review/text: I've been getting the dbl chocolate until this batch of cookies and cream, which I decided to try. The chocolate is great, but I wanted to try something different. The cookies and cream is just too strong and overwhelming. I don't really care for it straight, so I've been trying to dilute it with chocolate syrup. Not really working all that well. My 14yr old son likes it, and I've tried several times now to choke it down in hopes that it'll grow on me, but it's not working. My next batch I try out will be the vanilla.
