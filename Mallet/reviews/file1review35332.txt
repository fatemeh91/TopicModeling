review/text: One or two swipes with this broom and the handle starts unscrewing and twirls the broom all over the place. Then you have to stop sweeping and screw the handle back on. Now do this a dozen times before you've finished sweeping the kitchen and you'll be ready to throw this useless piece of junk out.
