review/text: I am also disappointed that the instructions say no salts. I told my wife to give it a year before we try to put salts in it. At least let her get some use out of it before we put it to the test. Other than that she has had no complaints and the salt thing doesn't bother her a bit. The product works as advertised; very well. I will write back in year and let you know about the salt experiment.One warning: Make sure you pull the power cord out before you fill the tub with water. I'm sure others will agree...
