review/text: These melatonin tablets work as advertised. However, here are some tips:1) REDUCING THE DOSAGE: I found that I was groggy the next day after taking a 3mg tablet. The next night, I cut a tablet in half (with a knife) and swallowed the half-tablet. The next day I felt just a little groggy in the morning. On the third night, I cut the remaining half-tablet in half and that gave me two quarter- tablets. I swallowed the quarter-tablet, slept very well, and woke up the next morning with very little grogginess.2) I also found that it helps taking melatonin at least 30 minutes before you go to bed. Unlike a sleeping pill, it takes a bit of time for the melatonin to work.
