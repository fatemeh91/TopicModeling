review/text: I bought this in the Dahlia print. It's definitely cute and covers the eyes well. The fabric is smooth, and you really can open your eyes without brushing your eyelashes on the inside. There's a little space where light can show through around the nose, but that can be fixed with a little arranging. The only reason I give this 4 instead of 5 is because of the elastic. It's just a little too short, so the velcro on the back is exposed.After I had bought this first mask, I ordered three more at Christmas last year - one for my sister, one for my husband, and an extra for me. The first mask was just for travel and only used occasionally in bed. I'm not sure if frequent use caused the new ones to fall apart, but they did. My husband's lasted about two months with nap-time use, then the edges just disintegrated and the layers frayed badly. Mine lasted about six months and then frayed a little bit. I don't know why they fell apart. I was hugely disappointed since the first one lasted so well.
