review/text: I have owned this since 2005 and it works like new even today, after 6 years. I use it 5 days a week, every week. I tried a few other shavers in the last 5 years but nothing came close to the comfort and smoothness as this one. This is simply the best razor for less than 100 dollars out there in the market.
