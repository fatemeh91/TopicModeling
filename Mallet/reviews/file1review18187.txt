review/text: I have used a Bucky Mask for several years and bought a replacement one recently because the edges had been frayed from use on my old &#34;friend&#34;.If I want to sleep in or sleep during the day, it is a regular in making my life better.This new one is lighter and fits more comfortably.The feature that renders this sleeping aid outstanding is a &#34;dome&#34; over each eye which keeps the eyelids free from beingtouched.I thouroughly recommend the Bucky 40 Blinks Mask Ultralight Eye Mask.
