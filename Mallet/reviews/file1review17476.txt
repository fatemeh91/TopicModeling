review/text: When this dies, I'll look to another company. As a trimmer, it's fine, but the battery leaves much to be desired. I probably use it once a week, and have to remember to plug it in to charge before I want to use it, or else the battery will be nearly empty (when plugged in, it only charges the battery, it won't run from being plugged into an outlet).
