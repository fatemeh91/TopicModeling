review/text: Very good food-based vitamins. No bad smells, no artificial neon pee, tons of great quality ingredients- we have a winner! TTC and wanting a great vitamin to get me through this time- good stuff. Wish I had these my first pregnancy. The ginger and raspberry are a great addition, as is the inositol, and probiotics. Great price for 150 days of vitamins.
