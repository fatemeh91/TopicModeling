review/text: As I said in my title line, this is a well made product. But that's were it ends for me. First I ordered a 3x size and it was way too large, I returned it and ordered a 2x. The 2x fit tighter (at least would stay put on my knee), but give it a few minutes an it slid down to my ankle. So now I have a second item to return. Frustrating, believe me! So in conclusion, the measurement instructions are terrible.All I can say is that after years of purchases from Amazon and never returning anything. It is best (for me at least) to not order anything that requires a size! Now I am forced to drive all over the countryside for at least an hour trying to find a proper fitting support.Amazon has a very easy return policy! Just keep all packing, it will smooth things greatly. I was impressed!
