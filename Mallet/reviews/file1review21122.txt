review/text: I purchased this product because the muscles around my face/jaw area have been spasming from my chronic night clenching. Physical Therapy used moist heat on my face to treat my issue. This product gave me the same results I got from pricey PT visits. It is a bit ackward to have it around your face, but you get used to it. I do recommend this product to anyone experiencing muscle tension. It gives you what it claims.
