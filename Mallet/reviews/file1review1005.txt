review/text: Having a milk supply problem, my lactation consultant advised to start using More Milk Plus. In my area, I was only able to find it in 2 oz bottles for $20. The 8 oz is a much better deal. Although, I am still having to supplement with formula, I have had a measured increase in my milk supply. My only complaints are it tastes really bad, you have to take it 4 times a day and you have to be consistent for it to work effectively. I would recommend More Milk Plus. It has made a big difference for me.
