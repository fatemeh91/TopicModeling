review/text: I had a car accident over a year ago and have continual swelling and pain in my neck. My Chirorpractor recommended this for the swelling (therefore helping my pain), and increasing the dose if needed (for example after a major adjustment). Wow! Who would have known that this would work so well? I rarely have to take ibuprofin now. As an added bonus, it helps my asthma too! I'm not usually a homeopathic person, but this product has me sold!
