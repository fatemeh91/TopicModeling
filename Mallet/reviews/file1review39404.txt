review/text: This case containing my 1.75 glasses is not much larger than 2 pens in my pocket. Once I had a pair of these I no longer needed to carry a bulky glasses case in my pants pocket. I've never found the strap around the neck to work well. Putting several pairs of reading glasses in several locations works well most of the time, however, when out at a restaurant reading the menu I need a pair right with me. I own two pairs of these, one black and one red. The glasses are quite sturdy, and I think will last well. I can give this product 5 stars without reservation.
