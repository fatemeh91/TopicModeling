review/text: If you take a large amount of vitamins/meds or take large pills I wouldn't recommend this. I can hold maybe a few fish oil pills an then a med or two. I give it to my fiance who takes much less then I do. He loves it! These packs are the only way I can get him to take his vitamins.I fill them up, he takes that days pills with him to work and grabs the next pack the next morning. Works great.The packets lock nice. You don't have to worry about them coming open as they lock well. The whole unit is small enough to leave sitting out with out taking up too much space. It's not bad looking either. The colors chosen are nice.So again if you take a lot of stuff or have big pills I wouldn't buy it. If you just have a few things to take and would like the convenience of grabbing one days pills I highly recommend this.
