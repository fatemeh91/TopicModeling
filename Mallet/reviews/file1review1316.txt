review/text: The cup holder itself is a great idea. Unfortunately it does not allow for any sized cups and as such will not work with many tried. The holder also does not allow for someone who lifts the walker as the liquid spills out of it to easily.It was something that sounded like a great idea but just didn't quite make the grade.
