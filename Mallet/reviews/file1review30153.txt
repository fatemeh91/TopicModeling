review/text: Ingredients:- Calcium 123mg- Pfaffia rhodozyma Extract 200mg (yielding 2mg of Astaxanthin)Other ingredients:- dibasic calcium phosphate- stearic asid- hydroxypropyl cellulose- microcrystalline cellulose- colloidal silicon dioxide- modified cellulose gumThe bottle has the following warning notice on it:WARNING: Not intended for long term use. Not for use by children. If you are pregnant, may become pregnant, or breast feeding, consult your healthcare professional before using this product.There is no labeling on the bottle as far as it being gluten free or not (source of cellulose listed in the ingredients?).I wish Amazon would make the list of ingredients a required part of the product description for all food and medicine items.I've been taking this product off and on for short periods of time (not continuously, because of the warning on the bottle.) I have not finished the first bottle I ordered yet. Each tablet contains 2mg of astaxanthin. Research (see here: [...]) seems to suggest that at least 12mg's per day is needed to get the full benefits. And then again, the bottle says "Not for long term use."
