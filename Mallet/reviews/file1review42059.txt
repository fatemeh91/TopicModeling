review/text: TASTE:The first thing I noticed was the extremely strong clove taste. If you don't like cloves, do not get this, as it will gag you. I happen to like cloves, so this is ok for me.The second thing I noticed, was... vetiver? Did they actually use vetiver in a mouthwash? Looked at the label, and yes they did. A very weird taste, and will probably turn some people off. I happen to like vetiver, so this is mostly ok for me. Usually it's a cologne smell though, a smokey grass aroma, not a flavor.There may not be any alcohol in this product, but any cuts or abrasions in your mouth will burn like crazy when rinsing with this mouthwash.It is true that the taste stays in your mouth for a very long time, and that your mouth feels 'clean', or at least, scented.COMPANY BACKGROUND:Here is their official page:[...]Here is the family who makes this product, which mentions their Thieves Oil was used to 'fight off the black plague':[...]Here is a very, interesting, essay written by one of the family members, which asserts that the 'flu season is caused by Thanksgiving dinner', using the logic "If cold weather contributed to the flu, then why doesn't everyone in Canada have the flu all the time?":[...]SUMMARY:Is this different enough from normal mouthwash, to at least try one? Sure, why not. You may actually love it.Is this going to provide the endless miracles suggested by the makers of this product? There is not a chance, though its anti-microbial action may be legitimate.Should you use this product bottle after bottle without really looking into the ingredients or the company who makes it? I would suggest no.YMMV
