review/text: I am not going to talk about quality of ON products, they are among the best and in the past few years that I have been using them I have had no complaints.This is more about the flavor and I would give Mocha 4/5 for that. I had read some great reviews about it but in the end flavors are subjective to some extent. It has the mocha flavor but it's not strong enough and it does not mix as well with milk as some other flavors I have tried. To sum it up, I liked it but I am not jumping with joy, I like Cookies and Cream the best as it satisfies my sweet tooth (as well as cookie cravings).The reason I give it 3 stars is because of the higher price on amazon. I am a loyal customer and most of the time I just buy from here without bothering about price comparison. However, I was a little alarmed by the wide difference in prices by flavor so I check the bodybuilding.com store and it was cheaper there. Though the difference was not great I have grown to look at amazon as the best price place, guess sometimes one needs to look around!
