review/text: I purchased this to help supplement my weight loss efforts as I'm really terrible at making/preparing breakfast for myself everyday. I used this faithfully for one week, and felt pretty good. However, during the second and third consecutive weeks of using this in the morning (and eating balanced meals for the remainder of the day) I started to notice it was not being tolerated by my stomach. I would get ridiculously gassy and would have stomach pains. I tried different types of liquids (water, soy milk, 1% milk, etc) and got the same results with each. Unfortunately, I had to stop using this. Once I stopped, the stomach pains immediately went away. I still use it once in a while, but the stomach pains return more often than not so I've decided it's best just to throw it out.The good thing is that if this is something that you've been able to use and tolerate in the past, the 31 ounce canister is a great value through Amazon. This product would have definitely lasted a long time if I had decided to continue using it.
