review/text: For the man who believes that even at 50 he can still out maneuver the kids. This was a surprise gift for my brother's 50th. It has been one of his favorite lifetime gifts. It's his new best friend after rounds of golf, softball, Harley trips, you name it. He and his wife use it everyday often just before bed to relax into what they claim is the best sleep they've ever had. The design is ultra-smart. It's a lovely piece of furniture to fit decor in any room. I highly recommend this for wellness, too.
