review/text: I saw a demonstration of this product and thought it would meet my needs. My worst problem is the tub with moldy stains around the edges. I have tried so many products but nothing gets rid of it. I sprayed this on and left it on a awhile then wiped off. It did lighten the dark spots just not as good as I had hoped. I used it on an outside adirondack wooden chair with mold and black mildew. It worked pretty good on that but again not as good as I had hoped.I would say I think it is a good product. I think you do need to use a brush or microfiber sponge on some surfaces and I think it needs some elbow grease which I am disabled so I can't do that as strongly as is probably needed. Overall I think it is a pretty good product just keep in mind what to expect.
