review/text: This seems like a good product, but the sprinkle cap that comes with it does not fit it and falls off and then you get a big dose of the seeds in your recipe, instead of a sprinkle. The other thing I had a problem with was that I only intended to buy one jar of these and they sent two, but charged me for two for some reason, not sure why. The product seems fine, may be a little pricy though, I am sure you can find it cheaper elsewhere.
