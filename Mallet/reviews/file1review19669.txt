review/text: It's hard to get excited about a potty seat, but my toddler loves this one. We keep the BabyBjorn Toilet Trainer on a low hook next to the toilet for him to grab. He can carry it by the little rubber handle and (with some help) put it on the seat. I've already adjusted the potty seat to fit our elongated toilet. It fits nice and snug on top of the toilet seat with no rocking or tipping, and my son sits on it quite well with no danger of falling in or off it (he's almost 2 but he's big for his age). It fits round toilet seats too with just a turn of the dial, which makes it great for travel. I wish it came with a travel bag/carrier of some sort. (I'll have to make my own travel potty kit: an old duffel bag, flat-folding step stool, flushable wipes, disinfectant wipes, antibacterial hand gel, etc.) It's made of the same durable material as the seat that came with our white toilet so it matches perfectly, and it's easy to clean. I expect the guard in the front will keep things where they're supposed to go -- we haven't had a "full" event yet, but fingers crossed.
