review/text: I bought these batteries three weeks ago from Amazon -- they were a pretty good deal for the price, and I'm happy with my purchase. If Amazon still offered them, I'd buy more now. Unfortunately, (at least as of today) they're no longer available from Amazon; the price is the same as I paid earlier this month, but the seller is now J&R Music rather than Amazon, so the additional shipping charges have nearly doubled the effective cost. Look for other batteries from Amazon instead. (A reasonable price is twenty to twenty-five cents per battery.)
