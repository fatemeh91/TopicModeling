review/text: They are definitely a bit on the small side, but work much better than previous pair of tweezers...and feel much sturdier, even though they are about half the size. If I do get tired of using the &#34;mini&#34; tweezer, I will be tempted to give the normal-sized &#34;tweezerman&#34; tweezers a try. Worth the extra dollar vs the cheap tweezers.NOTE: They also come with a handy traveling case.
