review/text: Product is definitely a good one for anyone who takes their training seriously, and does not want to buy separate supplements (for example: glutamine)The only reason this gets a 4star from me, is the taste. Needless to say, it's not pleasant...so I try to down it as quickly as possible and brush my teeth shortly after!
