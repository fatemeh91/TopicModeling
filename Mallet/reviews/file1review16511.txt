review/text: First off im a soldier out here in iraq. I've been looking for something to take w/ my protien suppliment so help refine my core section and shed the layer of body fat on my mid section. Having been in the military 3 years now and working out daily i seem to be frustrated with the fact that my belly still has a layer of jelly in it. So being out here in iraq i decided to try STACKER 2 XPLC to help refine myself. First off... I've been taking it 3 times a day for 4 days already heres what i feel. I have a mild headache throughout the day... My body has a boiling blood sensation. It FEELS like its working the way its supposed to. I weighed in at 128lbs 4 days ago. I have lost 4 lbs in 4 days. I dont know from where though... i dont see any noticable loss on my belly yet but im sure within the next month i will notice. I haven't lost ANY muscle mass. I have lost about 1/2 in on my waist however. Keep in mind my methods are rather HARSE. 1 hour of weights at the gym and 3 mile runs every other days. I also have been regulating my calorie intake to 1200 calories NOT COUNTING the calories i get from 3 serverings of No-Xplode Syntha 6 a day. I also eat 1 small breakfast, usually cereal w/skim milk and a hearty lunch, no fast foods. I will keep you updated
