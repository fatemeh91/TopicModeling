review/text: I liked the idea of being able to carry daily pills in my pocket, but I currently have only one pocket-sized container and wanted a few more. This looked like a perfect fit, so I ordered it. I was very disappointed when it came because each container does come out, but is larger than needed and too big to comfortable fit in the front pocket of jeans.
