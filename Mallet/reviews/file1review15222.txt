review/text: The taste wasn't the greatest. It tends to leave an aftertaste. I found the bar to be extremely chewy but dry. I didn't notice any changes in energy levels either. The bar is ok for a quick bite when on the road with the kids to hold you over. I don't believe it's what the package says it is.
