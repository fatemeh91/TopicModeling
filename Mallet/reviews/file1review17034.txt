review/text: I've been using the MB-200 for at least three years now. My previous one broke after I dropped it. I've noticed that other reviewers are saying that they had issues with the battery, but I haven't had any. I used my previous one at least twice a week for three years and I've never had a problem. For the money, I've never found a better model of trimmers. I feel that this is an excellent value, which is why I bought an extra one in case they discontinue the model. Great value at Amazon too.
