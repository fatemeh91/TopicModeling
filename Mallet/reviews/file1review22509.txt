review/text: I got this for my wife and I, but we've never gotten any use out of it. First of all, this thing is simply way too wide. That isn't necessarily a bad thing for everyone, but the next thing is. Whatever this is made out of, it burns. It burns the tongue and mouth, the vagina, even the skin. We have other toys of similar design, and none do this. It can't be any sort of allergy, because it affected both wife and I and we have completely different skin types. Anyways, if you can bear the size, you probably won't enjoy the burning.
