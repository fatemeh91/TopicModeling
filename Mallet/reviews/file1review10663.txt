review/text: This is great stuff. I have used it for years and it has saved me from many incidents of terrible rashes. If you use at the early stages of reaction, it stops the spreading and dries up what is already there. It has worked for other kinds of allergic skin reactions to other plants as well. It is something I always want to have around.
