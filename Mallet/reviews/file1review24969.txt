review/text: MY husband and i have been trying to conceive for years now with NO luck, My period is all out of whack. I wanted to be put on Clomid but my Doctor told me that i should wait. But My husband and I want a baby ASAP. We just ordered fertilAid ..so I guess we shall see what happens. I was also told by my Doctor that I dont Ovulate...so Im going by stories on here that it can work. I really hope this works for me. I shall keep you all posted. Thanks for reading.-USMC Wife
