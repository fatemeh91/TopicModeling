review/text: My husband and I both like this shave gel. It's very moisturizing, and the scent is wonderful. It also fluffs up very nicely, so a little provides a lot of coverage. It has helped reduce irritation when I shave my legs as well. I have very sensitive skin that overreacts to everything, so I really appreciate this product.
