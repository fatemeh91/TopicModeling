review/text: compared this unit to the doctor's in his office and was pretty close. probably more accurate to take blood pressure at home since every time i go to the doctors office my blood pressure is taken as soon as i walk in without proper rest period and it always reads high. also, probably a little of the "white coat syndrome" where the stress of a doctors office comes into play.recommended.
