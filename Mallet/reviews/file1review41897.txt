review/text: I am 66 years old and have circulation problems in my feet. Both of them had gone to sleep permanently. I was in serious trouble and thought my walking days were about over. I surfed the internet for massages that may help and ran across this foot acupuncture machine. First let me say that it is not really acupuncture as no puncture is made. The device sends a series of shocks through your feet in diverse wave pulses. This does not hurt but you surely know you are being shocked by electricity as the muscles in your feet and ankles will contract in spasms. This machine works. I have feeling in both feet now and can move my toes again after just a couple of weeks. I am using it as I write this review. I do at least one 30 minute treatment per day while I am at my computer. What could be easier? I can hardly believe I got so much relief in a 75 dollar machine. I hope by writing this review others with similar problems will find the relief I have. I will never be without one in my house again.
