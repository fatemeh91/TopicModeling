review/text: I bought this after I started to feel guilty for leaving my butts on the ground. The construction's pretty solid and I like the fact that it snaps closed. The latching method is a bit of an oddity as the spring isn't actually a spring; more like a bent metal strip on the locking side. It was a bit of a struggle to empty it on my first attempt as it takes a bit of leverage against the sliding piece to accomplish. After a few times it's become second nature and emptying is much easier. The case sometimes emits a slight odor when full, so I try to keep it empty more often than not. Even so, I have yet to hear a complaint and I don't smell it unless I'm concentrating on it. It stores quite a few butts, provided you aren't ashing into it as well. If this one ever breaks, I'll grab another one, for sure.
