review/text: Yea I know the blades are a bit expensive but this razor shaves so close I couldn't imagine anything else. Plus they have to make up the money somewhere, they basically give the razor away for free. This razor is well worth the investment, I loved my Mach 3 but this is just much better in my opinion. Schick is in trouble now, their crappy 4 blade razor wasn't even as good as the mach 3 now what are they gonna do. I recomend this to everyone espically for those who love the close shave!!!
