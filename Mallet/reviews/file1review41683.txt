review/text: I bought this toothbrush after reading all the positive reviews, and am really glad I did! As a long-time Oral-B customer -- I previously used one of their inexpensive power brushes -- stepping up to one much more expensive wasn't something I was ready to do without some investigation. But I'm glad I took that step, because this model is far superior to the one I had before, and well worth its cost.I've yet to test out the length of time this will last between rechargings, but I'm pleased with the performance and quality of this product.
