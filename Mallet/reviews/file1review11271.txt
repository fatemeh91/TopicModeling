review/text: Waste of money. Very large, no texture, and it's hardly cheaper than the real brand. Shipping wasn't as discreet as I would've liked, fortunately I got to the mail before the others in my family. The cock rings are VERY uncomfortable, and do nothing for me. Overall, I would not recommend buying this product.
