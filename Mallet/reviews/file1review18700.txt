review/text: I owned this chair 3 yrs ago...for the price it gives a great massage. Unfortunately, a heavy-set guy used it and would slouch forward and moved the pressure plate...just about rendering it useless. I just received my new chair (after having waited for 16 months) and it still gives me the same satisfaction.I used this as my chair at work and could sit in the chair for 4+ hrs at a stretch, no problem. I weigh in the 200lbs area.I bought this at $100, and feel it is well worth the price at this price-point.
