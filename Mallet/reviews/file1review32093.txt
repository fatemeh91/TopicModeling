review/text: I have ruined 2 white 100% cotton shirts with the tide To Go Pen. Both were left with large yellow stains even though the very miniscule original stains were gone (salsa/sauce splatters). I will NEVER use this product again. After reading the reviews on the Tide website, I learned of several others having the same response. Tide claims the substance reacts somehow with natural light and recommends you "wipe the area" after use. Beware!
