review/text: I originally bought this potty because my oldest child's potty trainer was too big for my toddler, which scared her. I was gritting my teeth paying $[...] for a seat, but I told myself I could use our other potty seat (with Dora characters) for car trips or something. Forget it! Now that we've been using the Bjorn for a month, that other seat is going in the trash and if we need another seat, we'll buy a Bjorn again. Our old seat was always filthy and somehow managed to be dripping when you pulled it off the seat. The Bjorn potty is well designed and is not messy at all. I like the handle, so you can pull it off the potty without touching the seat. However, I can't imagine trying to hang this seat. It is not flat on the bottom at all.
