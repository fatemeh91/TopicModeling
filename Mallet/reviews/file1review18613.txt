review/text: I had been looking for a product such as this, and this is good for forearm and wrist work. And because of the bending as well as twisting actions and angles possible, works many of the arm muscles. I was twisting the #2 yellow, the second easiest one, and it snapped in half upon twisting. A disappointment. I am not a bodybuilder or powerlifter at all, I'm an old guy. So my set now is down to five and the beige #1 will probably break soon if I use it for warming up, which is not likely. #1 is so easy that it's suitable in my opinion only for beginning orthopedic rehab of broken bones, or the frail elderly. I wouldn't avoid these exercisers because they are so good at what they do. But this Cando manufacturer needs to strengthen the rubber compound so that they don't snap suddenly. I read elsewhere in Amazon reviews that I am not the only one who has a complaint about quality control of this brand.I recommend buying the blue one or preferably this black one only and trying it. It should be all you need to do what these exercisers do. It just won't go through as much range of motion as the easier ones. You can always buy an easier one later, and then work up to the heavy one you bought first. If you work with this twister in all possible positions for two weeks, you'll find you are stronger, with more range of motion, and not likely to need a weaker one. I find the #1, 2, 3, way too easy and I am guessing likely to suddenly break, after what happened with mine, if you really twist it as far as you can. And easily broken if you bend it into a U. Both of these movements are what they're supposed to do, aren't they?I just gave this black one as a birthday gift to a nephew, I like it so much.
