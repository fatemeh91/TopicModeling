review/text: These sheets are awesome, fitting a hospital bed with a thick air mattress/overlap (with machine pump) on top of the bed mattress. My mother is 97 and bed-ridden. These sheets wash great and fit easily over the thick mattresses. I like how the top sheet has fitted corners on the bottom so that it stays tucked in. This feature is nice because my mother has a lot of leg movement when she sleeps. The blanket is an extra value. Overall, I highly recommend these. I have two sets and this is all I use for the hospital bed.
