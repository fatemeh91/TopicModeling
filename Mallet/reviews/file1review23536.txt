review/text: My husband had been using a Metamucil powder. I wanted to begin a fiber supplement, and I wanted something organic. This product works best when I mix it into my oatmeal, or applesauce, or something with that kind of consistency. It does have a slight taste when I use 6 teaspoons in one bowl of oatmeal, and it is not unpleasant. This powder does not mix in without some clumping. My husband mixes one teaspoon into a small glass of water twice a day, and that works for him. I'm not sure it helps as much as I want it to with irregularity. I have been using it everyday for a month, and still do not BM everyday. Still a work in progress....
