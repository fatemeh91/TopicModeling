review/text: At my last cleaning, my dentist recommended that I get and use the Oral-B Triumph, so I did. I used the Triumph every day for the last 6 months. I just had my six month cleaning and the results were 100% positive. Significantly better dental health and the cleaning took half the normal time because my teeth were much cleaner using the Triumph. The results make the cost of the Triumph well worth it.
