review/text: I've been doing my husband's hair since we started dating. Recently my last set of clippers started to pull his hair, no matter how much oil I put on them. But these things are great! They're a little bigger than my last pair, but they're so much better quality. It comes with lots of attachments - more then I'd ever use. But it cuts his hair in no time! He even loves the sound that it makes. "Sounds like I'm at a real barbor shop!"
