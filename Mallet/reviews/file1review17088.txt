review/text: I purchased this Remington to replace an older model that is nearly identical to this one, that I've used continuously for the last fifteen years. I thought I'd have to settle for a cheaper and inferior design after this much time has passed, but luckily that wasn't the case. The old model wasn't titanium but it also never needed lubrication. I prefer to trim my beard short, about every other day, but nine length settings should be more than enough to handle anyone's preference. The model I replaced still worked perfectly, but the internal batteries were showing their age and needed to be charged more often than when they were new, which is a standard characteristic of NiCad batteries whether they're used in flashlights, portable drills, electric toothbrushes, or whatever. With such a low replacement cost, I just decided I wanted to purchase a new one. My past experience has been completely trouble-free ownership, at a purchase cost of half a cent per day for fifteen years, but that's just me. With millions sold, even brand-new BMWs sometimes experience a problem that requires repair or replacement, and that's no indication of low quality. So I find it entertaining to read mostly 5-star reviews with an occasional rabid review that was triggered by anyone who has experienced a problem with a product.
