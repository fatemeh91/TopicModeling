review/text: Ok, I have the goal of losing 100 pounds-- big goal. But in approximately 4 and a half months with TrimSpa, I've lost 40 pounds of that so far. I do take the maximum dosage, which is 6 tablets per day. I take 2 with a LOT of water before each meal. I've never felt jittery/irritable with TrimSpa. No negative side effects, except that I seem to go to the bathroom a lot more than I used to. (Sorry to be gross, just warning you!) I've barely changed my daily diet and have yet to exercise. I feel really positive about my experience with TrimSpa thus far.
