review/text: I was diagnosed with IBS many years ago. I suffered with horrible digestion issues, was always sick and weak and tired, and had skin problems. Through self research ( traditional doctors were hopeless ) and an excellent naturepath, I discovered my body needed digestive enzymes. Low HCL, pancreatic and gallbladder production. I have to take all three supplements with meals and I am now the healthiest I have been in all of my adult life. Word of caution to those who self research but do not take the time to get their digestive production tested: with my naturepaths guidance, we figured out the right proportions of enzymes to take. For instance, I need to take HCL with every meal and depending on how rich the food is, I may have to take more than one. Same goes for pancreatic and oxbile. If Im eating just fruit and oatmeal I only take pancreatic. If I have a salad with bacon and avocado I need to take my ox bile ( only one ). Remember, ox bile helps supplement those like me who have a weak gallbladder or those who have had theirs removed but if used incorrectly it can cause internal damage. I have used this product for over 4 years now with very satisfying results. Hope this helps
