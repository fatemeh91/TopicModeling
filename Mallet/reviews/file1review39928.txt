review/text: I have been looking around and this is the safest product I have found. It's healthy for you with only 70 calories! The taste is not good, but I just mix it with water. I use this after each workout I do, and I have seen a improvement. I will most likely buy this product again, but not the vanilla flavor. Next, Im going with the mixed berry or chocolate flavor.
