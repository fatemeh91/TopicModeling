review/text: I bought that stupid Elmo seat and it doesn't work. All of the other seats elevate the kid so that the pee (if you have a boy) goes flying across the room. This is the only ergonomically designed seat I've found that allows the body to sink low, and it's worth the ridiculous price in the end. Don't waste your time or money on anything else.
