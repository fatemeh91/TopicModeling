review/text: I was beyond thrilled when I found a rose-scented deodorant. I LOVE the scent of rose, and love using rose-scented products, like bubble baths, lotions, etc. It was an absolute dream to find that scent in a deodorant -- how perfect was that?! Well, when I was at our local Whole Foods Market recently, and saw a sample/tester available of this product, I tried it, and oh my gosh, did I smell like rose for a while! And unfortunately, I'm sorry to say that I don't mean in a good way. It is a lovely rose scent, but it was too strong for me, very perfume-y, and I don't know about anyone else, but I want my deodorant to smell subtle, and my scented body lotion to be what people smell (but that too to a not-so-strong degree). I guess if I or someone wanted to take the extra time and make the extra effort, you could maybe find a separate, empty spray bottle, and put only SOME of this rose deodorant in there and then distilled water(?) with it to dilute the fragrance, but then I'd have to wonder if the deodorant would work as well. I don't know. I SO wanted to love this product, and again, it's definitely a rose scent (not something weirdly rose like some "rose"-scented products), but it's just too strong and perfume-y for my taste. I'd suggest finding it, as I did, as a tester in a store, to see if you personally like it, because each person is different and will like different scents/strength of scents -- and you might love this!
