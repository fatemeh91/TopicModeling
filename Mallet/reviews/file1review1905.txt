review/text: I am writing this review not from the medical point of view: that is, not on whether it cures (or does not) a skin condition... I am reviewing it simply as an awesome body shower soap!The soap is excellent and goes a long way... A single drop can take care of a body part (a foot, for example). In spite of its name, it can be used in body parts other than feet with great success, and is a great overall soap and you do not need to have a skin condition to use it.It is as other reviewers said, very refreshing and gives a nice astringent quality when applying. It cleans oily skin, but at the same time it does not dry too much...Since I use it, I believe it helps with diminishing pimples and black heads, and with itchiness all over (not from a medical condition).I am surprised that some folk think that the reviews are false... In my experience, this is just a great product so my vote is that you try it once, and then decide...*** 2012 Update ***Just an update. The soap continues to be a good product. I have found, however, that it dries a bit too much in case you go to the pool daily during Winters, when the air (and the skin) are very dry. Otherwise, no problems and still highly recommended.
