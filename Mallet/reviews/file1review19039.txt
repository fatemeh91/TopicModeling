review/text: Since Benefiber isn't available on the shelves right now due to problems at the manufacturing plant, I have looked around and found a great substitute at Target. It's their in-store brand called Up & Up Clear Soluble Fiber Supplement which sells for around $10.00 for 16.7 ounces. In my opinion, it works exactly the same as Benefiber. Even when Benefiber becomes available again, I think I'll continue using the Target Up & Up product. It's cheaper and is just as good.
