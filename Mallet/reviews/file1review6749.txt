review/text: I have been an avid gym rat for 20 years and participate in many sporting activities. I frequently get knots in my neck and back and have to make appointments to the chiropractor on a regular basis. Not only is it an inconvenience during a busy workday, but the health insurance co-pay does add up. As soon as i heard of the Body Back Buddy, i had to buy and try it. I IMMEDIATELY felt a release in the knots and pressure built up in my back and neck and use it on a daily basis whether i need it or not. It is a an instant relief for any muscle knotting and stiff back and when you don't have a spare set of hands to use, the Body Back Buddy is a savior!
