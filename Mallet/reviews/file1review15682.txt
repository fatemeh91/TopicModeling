review/text: I tried taking EVERYTHING for Lymphedema complications of the leg. Everything else was frustrating and expensive. Capisette did exactly what is was suppose to. Now I am able to manage my lymphedema and live a more comfortable life and not break the bank or go to a fancy expensive doctor. If you continue to take this product it will continue to prove better results. GREAT PRODUCT I WISH I COULD GIVE 20 STARS!!!
