review/text: Anyone who says this product hasn't worked for them isn't using it properly. I take one when I wake up, and like a previous reviewer, go about my morning routine. It only works if you do it with diet and exercise, but I definitely feel a difference in my appetite. As a chef I am constantly around food. I find that I am able to go through my day being filled by just the food that I have to sample during the course of my work day. I'm never hungry and when I do have a meal, I'm always satisfied with reasonable portions. I've always been in fairly good shape and was just looking for something to help me firm up before I go to Mexico in just over a month. I've only been taking it a few days but I've already lost five pounds!
