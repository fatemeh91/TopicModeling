review/text: I love this stuff! Not having any issues with grittiness or dryness mentioned by others. I've been using natural/organic lip products for awhile, so maybe I'm used to less glossy formulas. This lip balm is thick, luxurious and lasts forever. I much prefer it to thinner balms that need reapplying every hour. A little definitely goes a long way.
