review/text: First of all I'm not sure they even shipped the right product. I received sticks with completely different designs on the front, and it says "Original High Endurance", with no mention of "classic."Anyway, the scent isn't bad, its just extremely strong.. you shouldn't be able to smell a deodorant from across the room, yet with this you can. With all the good reviews I've seen I expected this to be fairly good and ordered 6 sticks to save on shipping. Instead I wasted $28 on something I'll never use. Maybe I can give them as gifts to people I don't really care about?
