review/text: I use this soap daily in the shower, and it has significantly improved the keratosis pilaris on my upper arms and has started to eliminate body acne while leaving my skin soft and smooth. At the end of the first week, it had already reduced the KP on my arms by almost 25%. The reason this soap knocks out KP and early blemishes is that sulfur is a keratolytic, meaning it softens keratin. Keratin is a fibrous protein (the hard, waxy plug) that clogs pores, both in acne and KP.Another reviewer on a different page said that this soap smells terrible. I personally think the scent is very mild and non-bothersome; it hardly smells like sulfur at all. People who have tried the gamut of acne treatments shouldn't have any problem with its scent -- just don't go in expecting it to smell like Herbal Essences.The soap is a yellowy-beige color and feels slightly grainy during use. It makes a thin bubbly lather and washes off easily. Shop around for the best price -- I found mine both online and in a local health food store for less than it sells on Amazon. Recommended for people who want more control over their body's hyperkeratinization.
