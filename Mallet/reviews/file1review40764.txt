review/text: This razor is very poor - the razor blades have rusted alomst instantly which I think is very dangerous. Rubbing rusty metal against delicate flesh is not a good idea, particularly if you are not immunized against tetanus. Plus the refills are ridiculously expensive. Don't waste your money!
