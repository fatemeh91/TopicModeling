review/text: I too was afraid I would not be able to find these, when CVS took over our local (and much better) Long's Drug Stores and stopped stocking them, and Rite Aid never carried them. I am buying a couple 3 packs. They last for a very long time, but better to stockpile them now. You never know when some really good product is going to get bought up (like Long's, or Glide floss) and changed for the worse.
