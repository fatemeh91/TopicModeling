review/text: I got these not for a bed but to put under furniture covers to protect new furniture from old pets that sometimes have accidents. These work great. Nothing leaks through to the sofa and they are long enough to overlap so I can get really good coverage out of them. The couch protectors that are sold are too small for my couch and barely cover anything. These stay in place with a couple of large safety pins on the back. I got an extra one incase there is a problem. They have washed great and are saving my furniture but are also comforable to sit on and they don't make any plastic sounding noises. They have been a lifesaver!
