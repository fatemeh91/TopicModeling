review/text: I asked for the Opalescence that takes only 30 minutes. Instead received the type that takes ALL NIGHT!!!! I returned it, requesting the 30 minute tyep again. Received the variety that takes SEVERAL HOURS!!! I am returning it and asking for a refund.Who in the world would want an all-night teeth whitener???
