review/text: I wasn't sure if I'd like this hard plastic seat, having used a padded one with my first child. But this is a really wonderful potty seat. It it easy enough to use that my two and a half year old can put it on and take it off by herself, and the adjustability means it stays put solidly. You don't have to tighten it each time you use it - just dial the size to fit your toilet seat and you can take the potty seat off and put it on easily, yet it still really stays put when it's in use.I had this seat and a Rubbermaid Roughneck (9.5" high) step stool upstairs, and a Mommy's Helper Contoured Cushie Step Up downstairs. I noticed my daughter was going all the way upstairs to use the potty, she preferred the Bjorn so much! So now we have two Bjorns and the Mommy's Helper is going to consignment.It's a nice bonus feature to have the hanging loop. I put a Command hook on the bathroom wall, and my daughter takes the seat off and hangs it up when she's done.
