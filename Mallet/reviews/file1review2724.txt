review/text: I have been a loyal Beanpod customer for years. I absolutely LOVE the pomegranate scent and Earthly Embrace scent. I have purchased my pomegranate scent from 2 different places and received 2 different scents. Even though they are properly labeled, colored and the exact same size - they smell nothing of the same. I contacted Beanpod Candles and they assured me they have not changed the scent formula, but the proof is in the wax. Buyer beware. Smell your candles before you burn them and find out the return policy. I don't know who is responsible for this but it seems no one knows what is going on and what the reason is for 2 different scents. Very disappointing. Beanpod didn't even offer to make amends for this in any way. The distributor offered to take back the ones I have not burned, as long as I pay for shipping. 4-5 25 oz candles can get pretty heavy/$$$$. Doesn't make any sense to bother returning. I'd probably get about 3% of my money back in the end.
