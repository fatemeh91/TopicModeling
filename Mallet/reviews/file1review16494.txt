review/text: I just received the magnetic bracelet. I wear magnetic bracelets because of tendonitis and arthritis in the hands and wrists and let me say, they work. I don't know why, but they DO work. The Sabona bracelet is very nice and good looking, just beware of the sizing. I have a large wrist and I ordered the extra-large because of the pricing and rebate, figuring I could take out a link to make it fit. The extra large is really a large, so if you are really a large man, the extra large will not fit. Other than that, it's stunning!
