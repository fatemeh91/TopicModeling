review/text: I've been searching high and low for a green-tea scented candle. I have found a lot of "green tea/citrus" and scents like that, but not just simply "green tea". So when I found this one, I bought it right away. None of the other reviews I read, even negative ones, seemed to mention Beanpod candles smelling gross. So I bought it. Candles cost too much as it is, but when I spend 20 bucks and then get something like this, I'm very disappointed.It did not smell like green tea in the slightest. The best I can come up with to describe the smell (which I could smell before even opening my package when it came in the mail), was some cross between AXE Body Spray and campground latrine disinfectant. It stung the nostrils. Just awful. I don't know how anyone could find this scent enjoyable, let alone claim that it smells anything like green tea.
