review/text: The Oral-B Triumph Professional Care Power Toothbrush is wonderful. It is everything it is advertised to be and better than previous models of Oral-B Power Toothbrushes. After one brushing my teeth felt smoother and cleaner than they did using the Oral-B 7550 Professional Care Power Toothbrush and the Oral-B Triumph cleaned my teeth very well, yet at the same time it is not harsh or damaging. It is a magnificent toothbrush and I am glad I purchased it.
