review/text: So I read ALL The reviews & I bought this, wanting something.... softer. My most recent few toy purchases have been glass & I just wanted to change it up - wanting something more life-like, etc. Got it, opened it, said to myself YUM! Great size and shape, LOVE LOVE LOVE the feel of the rubber or whatever its made of - just the right squeeze, feels so real, not too smooth, just the right grab factor. Didn't bunch up at all when I used it (as some "soft" dongs do), fills in all the right ways... Nice texture, doesn't require too much lube. Not too big at all, but I am 5'9" and 160 lbs so take my word with a warning, if you are very petite maybe want to work up to this.The smell (I got the blue) is kindof blueberry like, not a bad smell at all like I heard some say - I'm guessing they changed the smell. A tiny bit strong tho so I store it in a closed container, no big deal.Last word, BUY IT. Of all my toys (Ivibe rabbit, don wands, doc johnson glass, cheapo vibes), this is my FAVORITE. No kidding, hands down. LOVE IT!Best substitute while my flyboy is away during the week ;)
