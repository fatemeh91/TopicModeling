review/text: So. How did I end up in the ER TWICE because of these pills. So, 6yrs ago a friend told me about Zantrex and encouraged me to try it. I took 1 pill a day for a couple of weeks and was super excited to see the pounds MELT off of my body. I got SO skinny! I figured I could try to double the dose and took 2 pills. BIG mistake. Had a MAJOR panic attack (?) and ended up in the ER thinking I was dying. Shaking, couldnt breath, irregular hearth beat. Very scary. Just a horrible feeling! I threw away my bottles and staid away from all types of dietpills..Fast forward a couple of years. My daughter was almost 1, we were going to Hawaii and I still had a few baby pounds to drop.. PANIC.. lets try Zantrex again. 1 pill and I could tell right away that it was BAD. Of course I ended up in the ER again and I ended up having to see my reg. DR 2 more times the following days for EKG's showing irregular heartbeat and I had to take anti-anxiety meds for a couple of weeks. HORRIBLE!! I dont know why no ones has sued the manufacturer! So MANY perfectly healthy people have ended up in the hospital after taking this supplement! I havent touched this stuff in 3yrs and I NEVER EVER will again!
