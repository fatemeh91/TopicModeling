review/text: I have owned two cordless Black & Decker vacuums... I have never been very happy with them so I decided on the corded model to clean up around the litter box. HA! The clever little rotating brush attachement froze up almost at once. Any small piece of dirt/litter jams it and it's useless.While the vac has more power than the cordless models I am, once again, UNDERWHELMED. The item is cheap, dirty and difficult to clean. The attachment hose and brush are a flimsy joke. I'm going to order another Eureka Optima for my downstairs pet area.
