review/text: I read about this somewhere and decided to give it a try. I think it's a precursor to hormone function that declines with middle age. I use one a day along with one Pueraria Mirifica by Anterol and I no longer have hot flashes and cold sweats, or even mood swings. Ever. My hormones feel completely balanced for the first time in my entire life. I also take antioxidants, excercise and try to eat a healthy diet for the most part. But without a doubt, I have noticed that I feel much more balanced by using this product and there aren't any side effects.
