review/text: I bought the Remington MB-200 Titanium Mustache and Beard Trimmer for my husband because he needed to do some much needed manscaping. I wasn't even sure he would use it, but lo and behold not only did he use it, he loved it and has continued to use it with regularity. Yippy!! It's easy to use, easy to clean and the price is perfect.
