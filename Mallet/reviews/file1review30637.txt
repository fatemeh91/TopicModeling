review/text: I have always been a wet shaver and enjoy the process of lathering up with a good badger brush. It has irked me for a long time to have to team the scuttle, brush and soap with a piece of modern plastic. I was delighted to find that traditional double-edge razors were still in production and purchased this model from Merkur.I was expecting that I would sacrifice closeness and comfort for the stylishness of using this classic but am delighted to report that I sacrificed nothing in making this step back in time. This razor rivals, and in my opinion exceeds, the efficiency of modern multi-blade razors.Yes, it is safe! I have nicked myself less (actually zero times so far) with this beautiful instrument than with anything else I have tried.Bravo Merkur!
