review/text: I've used a few other protein powders which didn't restrict carbs/sugars and this bad boy (rich chocolate) from Dymatize still tastes great if not better than Optimized Nutrition products. It's sweetened with Stevia (A+) NOT Splenda, Malitol, etc. Highly recommended if you're looking for an alternative to the overpriced Jay Robb. Try it for yourself at this price.
