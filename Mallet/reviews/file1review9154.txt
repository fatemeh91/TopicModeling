review/text: If you can get past the smell, this is a great product! No, it doesn't smell bad, really, but if you don't aim it carefully it will make your eyes water. Excellent for all kinds of aches and pains and you don't get any greasy stuff all over your hands; you just spray it on! We always have it on hand and use it often.
