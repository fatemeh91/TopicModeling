review/text: Our three year old son is incredibly comfortable using this toilet seat. His fear of falling in is completely quelled. It's so simple for him to insert and remove as needed. Love the handle on the back. The construction is terrific for boys who want to begin potty training sitting down to pee. No mess!!!
