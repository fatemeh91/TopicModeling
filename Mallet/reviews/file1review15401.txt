review/text: This is one oil that i am really comfortable incorporating into my hair regimen. I was using Hesh Brahmi amla and shikaiki oils, but really didn't seem to attain much growth. there are reviews that claim that it makes their hair grow, more powere to them.But when someone posted about the mineral oil, i really started doing my research. It seems that as long as i used the Hesh oils, i was not attaining my goals, and after quite a few bottles (and in about 6 months to a year) started experiencing breakage. You know, those little short hairs that show up in the basin? Or on your light colored clothes? That's breakage. Not a hair phase. I didn't want to admit it was the Hesh oils because i had stock piled quite a few bottles of this stuff.I changed my regimen, and began weaning away from the Hesh Oils. I started using the Bhringarj oil and pills, noticed a difference right away. My scalp tingles most of the time, my hair is healthier - not greasier, and i am finally attaining my hair goal.If you look at the ingredients on the hesh oils brahmi and shikaki, you'll notice this long list. 4 other oils (including Vegetable and Mineral oil) - before you even see the word "Brahma" and another long list of ingredients before you see "Amli"...But if when i looked at the Bhringaraj bottle there were only two: Sesame Oil and Bhringaraj* (*certified organic)
