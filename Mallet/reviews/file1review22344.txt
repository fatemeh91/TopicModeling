review/text: Bought one for my wife when she was experiencing pain in wrist and thumb from holding our newborn. Measured her wrist to be about 5.9 inches in circumference, so it is within the range recommended for the small size. With the Velcro strap aligned properly, it was too loose and did not provide much wrist support at all. To get it tighter, we had to stick the velcro on the blue part of the wrap. However, wearing it tight like this to support the wrist caused thumb numbness after a few minutes, so she stopped using it.
