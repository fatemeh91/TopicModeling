review/text: I had a previous Emjoi gentle caress epilator, which lasted for over 10 years. It's very effective for underarm and facial hair removal. Since getting this model, I've branched out to legs because of the wide coverage area. The shorter the hair and more times you have used the remover, the less pain you will feel. The longer hair shaver attachment is perfect for this. I actually have no side effects any more (bumpy and red skin after use). I can actually use it right before walking out the door. It's the most comfortable model model of the two.
