review/text: I bought this blood pressure testing device as a gift for a friend. He kept complete records of the readings, multiple times daily, and showed them to his Doctor. The Doctor was very pleased with the accuracy of the blood pressure testing machine, and so is my friend. This device had the highest rating for the price range of any on the internet!!!
