review/text: I had a very obvious wart on my upper left arm for the past five or six years. I was self-conscious, and it often became irritated and red, making it even more embarassing. I had a few other warts on my hands, as well. I chose this product because it had the highest amount of salicylic acid I could find. Within one week, literally, the embarassing, fairly large wart was completely gone. I actually had more problems with the adhesive from the bandages I bought than from the chemicals in this, and there's no scar or sensitivity. I keep looking at my arm and smiling. Right now, I'm treating the warts on my hands, and I'm very satisfied.
