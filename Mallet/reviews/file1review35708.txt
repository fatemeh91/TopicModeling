review/text: I suffer from such dry eyes that I used to wake up every morning with my eyes crusted, and then they'd run for about an hour after I got up. They'd become irritated, itchy, uncomfortable & weepy several times a day. Once I ended up making an emergency visit to an Ophthalmologist (M.D. who specializes in eye disease and surgery) because I was in so much pain I couldn't open one eye. Turns out that the irritation from being so dry caused swelling, so the doc put me on steroid drops for about a week to stop the inflammation. To help with the dryness he recommended Alaway drops.Alaway worked well for the most part (it did sting a little bit) but it can only be used every 12 hours, and there were times when the relief didn't last more than a few hours. After 3 years of using Alaway, I saw this Similasan Dry Eye Relif at the store & bought it because it can be used any time I need it - and because where I shop, Similasan is LOTS cheaper than the Alaway.I LOVE the stuff. It doesn't sting like other meds, and it produces instant relief. If my eyes start to feel itchy or dry any time day or night, I can use one drop or 2 or 3 without any side effects. I'll never go back to Alaway or any other eye drop unless I need medical care that results in a prescription.
