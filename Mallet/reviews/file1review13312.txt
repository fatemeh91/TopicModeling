review/text: The priva waterproof protector is really what it says it is. I purchased 3 different bed protectors for bathing a patient in bed and this one is by far the best of the 3. It is worth the money. It is long, from the head to almost 3/4 of the twin size hospital bed, and holds the most water of the 3 protectors I purchased. I highly recommend it.
