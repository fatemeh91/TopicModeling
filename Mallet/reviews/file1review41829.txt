review/text: I have both the Sonicare Elite and the Triumph. Both do an excellent job of cleaning your teeth. The Sonicare has more side to side action while the Triumph has a more circular motion. The Sonicare beeps at you to move every thirty seconds, the Triump makes a motor sound prompting the same action. Both have excellent grips and its easy to change the brushes. And both have good battery life, though I'd give a small edge to the Triumph.I really like my Triumph because it holds its charge well and the brush motion feels more like what the dental hygenist uses. Some reviews comment that the brush is too noisey -- give me a break. Both the Sonicare and the Triump make noise appropriate to the task at hand.The best part of these two brushes is that they make you brush for two minutes. The Sonicare asks you to get a new brush every 6 months, the Triumph every 3 months. Replacement heads for the Triumph are less expensive.If you asked me which brush I'd grab for a trip, my preference would be the Triumph, But, if I grabbed the Sonicare by mistake, all would be well.Either one does a great job.
