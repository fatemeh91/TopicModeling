review/text: My physical therapist had recommended the Back Buddy to me.I didn't order it because I thought it looked too bizarre and strange.(My loss!)Now that I don't live near her anymore, I ordered it out of desperation. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the Back Buddy and seriously don't know how anyone could do without one.The AccuMassage--ehhh. I'm lukewarm on it. Haven't found it to be as valuable as other folks have said it is. The Back Buddy really takes care of anything on the neck and shoulders way better than the AccuMassage, but I'm not too upset--the set wasn't a bad deal hear on Amazon. But I really didn't need both.
