review/text: I ordered this brace because I have just gotten off crutches after a serious sprain. I was thrilled when it was delivered a mere 2 days after I ordered it. The brace I was sent was manufactured by a company called Swede-O. My fault with this product is that I trust the Pro-Tec company name and order their brand of protective gear and have never been unsatisfied with the quality.I do not like being misled and not being given the product I ordered.
