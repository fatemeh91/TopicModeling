review/text: I wish I could give this product ten stars. I have four children. As a nurse, I always just went for the motrin or tylenol; which was less than okay for my other children, but just not enough for our newest addition. These work better than anything I have ever tried!!! We are out right now, I ordered some more and let me just say, they can't get here soon enough! What's even better is, if needed, they can be administered with motrin (if your baby is over 6 months) or tylenol. I have never had to do that!!! Infact, I usually only have to give my baby one or two doses of the humphries a day!!! I am absolutely impressed.
