review/text: Therapy is VERY calming and relaxing. The mix of lavender and Citrus is perfect (I was afraid it'd energize me more and keep me awake all the time) together and smells fantastic. Its very moisturizing and makes a great moisturizer and lip balm (I know, i'm strange, but it doesn't taste bad and it makes my lips soooo soft)
