review/text: I have used Hammer Gel for climbing Mount Whitney (14,500') in a dawn to dusk hike; for lesser mountains but longer climbs such as Mauna Kea (13,500') on the Big Island of Hawaii; and, for 5K competition races. I particularly like that it is ultra low sugar so you do not get insulin spikes. Also, you can drink it right out of the container without mixing, if you so desire. I think all the Hammer products are great and recommend such for serious athletes or active persons who spend more than two hours climbing, running, jogging, bicycling, kayaking, swimming, windsurfing, etc.
