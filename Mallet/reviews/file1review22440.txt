review/text: I am not a big pantyhose wearer so wearing support hose isn't ideal for me. However, on the days that I force myself to wear these they definitely help alleviate swelling in my legs and generally make my legs feel better longer. I bought the 8-15mm hose and you can feel the compression, but it is not uncomfortable. I do not recommend these in hot climates because they up your body temp, which makes them great in cold weather.
