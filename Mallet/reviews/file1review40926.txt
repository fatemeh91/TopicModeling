review/text: I received this razor as a gift about 4 years ago and it always gives great results!I recently tried a Braun Series 3 and it did me no justice whatsoever. However, one issue I've had with the Shave Pro is after I wash the blades out, the next time I go to use it the power pulsates up and down as if the batteries are running out of juice (even w/new batteries).
