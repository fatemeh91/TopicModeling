review/text: This arrived yesterday and I immediately put it to work. It looks smaller than I expected, but has tremendous capacity for sucking up junk - mainly dog hair. I have a very hairy dog but I hate lugging out my heavy vacuum cleaner (she hates it, too!) for quick clean-ups, especially on the linoleum kitchen floor. This sweeper is light and quiet, does a neater job than a broom, and is great not only on the bare floor but on the carpet - and the carpeted stairs, where it's hard to get my upright vacuum to fit. I love that the brush pops out so easily for cleaning with the included comb. My one complaint is the same as the other reviewers': the handle falls apart periodically. It would be easy for the manufacturer to fix this by making the pieces screw together or have some kind of locking mechanism, while keeping the parts small enough to store the sweeper in a tiny space (which is, I guess, the reason for having the handle in four parts). It won't replace my vacuum for thorough cleaning but will be fantastic for regular tidying-up.
