review/text: Wasn't sure which one to buy but settled on this one as a "low end" item to start with and learn to cut my own hair (ok, actually my wife cuts my hair with it). It works great, very sturdy metal case, doesn't feel cheap. The blade guides are extremely easy to use. It comes with an instruction booklet but you don't really need it. I would recommend this. Well worth the price.
