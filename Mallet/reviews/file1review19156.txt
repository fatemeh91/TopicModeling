review/text: I decided to give this a try for tinnitus after seeing my doctor, an ENT specialist & still coming up with no solution. I have a constant buzzing/crackling sound in my right ear that showed up a few weeks after a bad cold & hasn't left for months. It's debilitating.I take 2 of these capsules in the morning and 2 before bed. It doesn't clear it up completely but it absolutely reduces the noise, both in duration and volume. I didn't realize just how much until I ran out of them yesterday. I didn't sleep at all last night because the buzzing & crackling was back full force & would not stop. I am typing this through the haze of noise, and then am off to my local health store to pick up more.Again, if you are expecting this to completely solve the problem you will undoubtedly be disappointed. But it's worth a try to at least save some of your sanity & reduce the noise.
