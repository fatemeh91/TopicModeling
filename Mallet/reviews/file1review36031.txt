review/text: taste is almost unbearable but that is free form arginine for you!! be prepared to use this in some juice to mask that taste. I really dont suggest just water and this product. if you try it then you will understand why. if it tasted better i would give it 5 stars. however that is not NOW Sports fault. thats just how free form arginine is.
