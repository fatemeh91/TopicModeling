review/text: I have had allergies and been a "mouth-breather" when I sleep for my whole life. My husband is a light sleeper, so my snoring was keeping him awake at night. I tried the strips out of curiosity. My husband says they work great in reducing my snoring! They are helping me learn how to breathe through my nose when I sleep (I now find I cannot fall asleep without one). An added benefit is that my morning congestion has significantly diminished, and consequently, my allergy medicine intake has as well (so for me, they're worth the price!)
