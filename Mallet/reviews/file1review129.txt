review/text: Warm, soft and cozy. I ordered this for my mom's broken foot, thinking it was made for a cast (I guess the reviews made it show up in my search?) and had a good laugh when they arrived as a pair and we realized these were just regular -- albeit very, very, very large -- socks. Highly recommended for abnormally large feet and/or foot casts.Thanks, Pedifix :D
