review/text: Edit* Sorry I wrote this while I was a little excited the first time so let me reword it.Anyways. I had tried many other products to remove a wart that was growing on my thumb in a place that was very noticeable. I couldn't even caress my fiances skin without bothering her with it's roughness. This worked when others didn't. It was funny since I had tried everything from burning the wart off to cutting it off and then burning the wound, so that the wart wouldn't come back. That was after I tried too many over the counter meds that didn't work. This worked for me an it might for you. It's awesome that the wart fell off with this product, after it had regrown back so many times in that same year!PS. I mostly used it 3-4 times a day and covered the spot with duct tape, every time.Be careful though, it looks just like chapstik. Your kids might put this in their mouth thinking it is!
