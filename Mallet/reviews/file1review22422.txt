review/text: This product probably works really well but I just couldn't keep using it because it comes off in the shower and you have to keep each patch on for 3 days, take it off, wash it everyday, let it dry and then put it back on. Some people are good at stuff like this but I feel it's tedious and too easy to forget a step when you lead a busy life.
