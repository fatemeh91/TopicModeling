review/text: Does it work? Yes. Can it be improved? Big time. Shall you get this? Please read.Firstly about its design flaws: 1) It should be height adjustable. 2) It should be refillable by end-user.Secondly once you get the base unit, you'll need to get their expensive bottles forever, unless you force the cap open & use those bulk quantity shower cleaner refills like those made by Method (sold via Target).Thirdly, it worked wonder when I lived in an apt. w/ city water. But now that I live in a house w/ well water, it doesn't make my shower cleaner but on the contrary, it makes it worse - by leaving these streaks of semi-sticker residue all over! So this is not a one-for-all-water-type solution at all.It's very expensive to get their refills, those are where they GOTCHA!
