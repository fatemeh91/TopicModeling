review/text: I have a stainless steel table, so I use stainless cleaner a lot. I like this one because it works while still smelling nice, not like petroleum. I feel safer with my family eating off a natural product. That being said, it is a little tricky to get right and the beginning of the bottle seems to be the worst. But when I continued using it, it cleaned better and easier.
