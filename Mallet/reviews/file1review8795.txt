review/text: I take a great many supplements, which makes it hard to tell just how effective any given item is, but the Green Vibrance seems to help with regularity among other things.The quantity provided is very generous. The bottle says 60 day supply, using one heaping scoop per day, but I tend to get closer to 90 days out of a jar.While the directions say to mix it with water, the result is very unpleasant tasting. I mix it with a zero-sugar-added cranberry juice, and it is much more enjoyable. It does require frequent stirring to keep the parts that don't dissolve mixed in, and there is often a significant amount of residue left on the inside and bottom of the glass.
