review/text: i JUST received this item, so i don't know how good it is as a supplement (i'm sure its great as far as what whey protein powders are supposed to do), but i had high expectations for the taste for some reason. all the reviews made it sound really tasty and it is top-rated on almost every website i checked. now, i LOVE food - cooking it, eating it, talking about it, so i consider my taste buds to be pretty accurate. well i guess i must be really spoiled by the protein powder sold at my gym, but i thought this stuff was bland, mineral-y, and left a weird aftertaste.you might all be thinking, uh, isn't that all protein powders? well the brand sold at the gold's gym i go to (supplement Rx) is WAY tastier, tastes EXACTLY like chocolate milk when mixed with skim milk. although, i cannot find it anywhere outside the gyms (i'm guessing they have a contract) and it costs like $60 for about a lb less than this 5.5 lb tub. i was hoping i would like this stuff more, since it is cheaper and comes with more product. now i have 5 POUNDS of this bland stuff. maybe i just need to give it another chance, mix it with some milk (i did try it with just water initially). although, the golds gym stuff tastes awesome with even just water.with a name like double chocolate, i guess i was just expecting too much. now i just have to get through these 5 lbs and go back to my old smaller more expensive but TASTIER tub.
