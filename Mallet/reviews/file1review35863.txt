review/text: i just tried this out on my face as i've had a horrible case of razor burn all day. with this i got a mild burning feeling at first, but i see this as a good thing because it means something's got to be working! then it just felt soothing. works for me! i wouldn't mind using it after every shave. i like how the "balm" feels - it's like a light lotion that disappears into your skin. i think i like it better than "gel." i'm using this to replace the gillette "complete control" green after shave gel.. that didn't do much for me.the only thing i'm worried about is this bottle.. i can picture it already. once i start to run out, it will take too long to get into my hands. i'd prefer a plastic squeeze design for convenience.
