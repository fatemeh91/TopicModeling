review/text: Bigger than a baby bottle brush but strangely more useful. This brush is not going to fit into a bottle that can be sealed with a cork. It is however great for Nalgene type water bottles, teapots, bread tubes, the medium size aluminum thermoses (?) thermi (?). It reigned victorious in both its duel against the aging chef wizard thingy and an accidental spin (handle first) in the garbage disposal.
