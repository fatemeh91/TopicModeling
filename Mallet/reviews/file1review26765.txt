review/text: I have purchased this protein for the last year and cant imagine going to something else.It mixes in water with no lumps, not thick so easy to swallow, and taste great.I have been seeing great results and quick recovery after drinking this vs. other protein supplements.I wanted to push to see if they can provide a subscribe and save on this product so for people like me that order a 5lb container every month can save a little money.I am sure there are many who would love to have this benefit.I have only tried Chocolate and Double Chocolate...I never get sick of it. Like drinking chocolate milk.
