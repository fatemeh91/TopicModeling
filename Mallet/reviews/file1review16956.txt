review/text: This trimmer is awesome. Rechargeable (nicad), 9 length settings, and it only cuts the hairs you want due to the full enclosure over the blades. You could buy one of the more expensive ones with a lithium battery, lcd display, and vacuum, but do you really NEED all that out of a trimmer? Pick this bad boy up, you won't be disappointed.
