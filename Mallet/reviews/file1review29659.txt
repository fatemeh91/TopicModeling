review/text: I had gotten a huge box of disposables prior to giving birth because I started leaking colostrum well before my daughter was here... both before AND after having her, the disposables did nothing but irritate me. I bought these right after giving birth and used them the entire time I breastfed! They were awesome! I love the lace... it does help them keep from slipping! I don't understand why so many people say they look lumpy or noticeable under their clothing... I could never tell, but I always wore a nursing bra so maybe that is the difference, but IDK. I m buying a few boxes of these this time around (about to have my second daughter) and am really excited about it. Also to the reviews that said they didn't 'fit' for larger breasts... I wear a size 40 D and they 'fit just fine for me. I don't see why they would need to be bigger than your nipple. I do always keep an extra set in my purse though... I tended to leak when a kid would cry even if it wasn't my daughter! So weird when grocery shopping or something! LOL!
