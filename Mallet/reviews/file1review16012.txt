review/text: If you want to shave your head, there is simply no better way to do it. I have done it on and off with a regular razor (M3 Turbo) for years and have nicked and scalped myself many times. It took time and usually resulted in some blood. The Headblade Sport is so easy to use that I can shave my head in just a couple of minutes with no pain and no blood. I actually look forward to using it! Get it!
