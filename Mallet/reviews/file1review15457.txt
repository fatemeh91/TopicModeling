review/text: I have researched a lot of changing pads and even visited several stores to find the best changing pad for our nursery. We ordered this DaVinci pad sight unseen and my husband and I were very pleased with the quality as well as the size. My husband built a changing pad tray for it to fit down in and place on top of her dresser and it fits perfect. The extra few inches in length seem to make a big difference!
