review/text: This bottle brush works really well to clean my stainless steel 27 oz water bottle. Here is why I like it:1. The diameter on the opening of my water bottle is 1 3/4 inches, and this easily fits inside.2. The handle and brush combined are a foot long, which makes it very easy to clean the bottom of the bottle.3. The leading negative review mentions another brush that has a slanted handle, which supposedly makes cleaning easier. But the handle on this brush is very flexible, and will bend and slant at whatever angle you want with just a little pressure.4. The bristles are effective at cleaning both the bottom and sides of the water bottle.5. The grip on the end of the handle is somewhat thicker, which makes it easy and comfortable to hold this brush while cleaning.Bottom line: This is sturdy and well made, and cleans effectively.
