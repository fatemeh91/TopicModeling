review/text: This really helped with upper back pain for me. I'm a home visit nurse & this really helps support my belly when I'm working. It really fits well, although there aren't enough rows of hooks. There should be more than 3 because everyone has a different comfort level. To remedy this I sewed on an extra row of hooks & eyelets. Overall it's worth the money.
