review/text: I am a nurse and have used the Omron HEM-629 wrist monitor this for for past year to monitor my blood pressure. There are many times I receive the message "E" on both wrists and the machine will not give me a read out even with new batteries.....There does not seem to be a fix for this......I was hoping to continue to use this machine but have decided to give up on it.....
