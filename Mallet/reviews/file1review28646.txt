review/text: I had gastric bypass almost 2 years ago now. As part of the protocol, I'm supposed to drink a protein shake once per day. As you can imagine, this can get to be pretty boring flavor wise so I'm always trying new brands and flavors. The simple fact is, I keep coming back to ON Gold Standard Extreme Milk Chocolate (or double rich chocolate) over and over again. It's simply the best. The flavor is excellent. It doesn't taste like it has &#34;diet flavored&#34; sweetner in it. It's just simple and delicious.I don't have to worry too much about calories so this may not help a lot of you out there. But if you just need to get some protein in you every day for whatever reason, try my shake recipe out:1.5 (12 oz) water2 scoops of ON Gold Standard - Extreme Milk Chocolate/Double Rich Chocolate3 Tablespoons of Peanut Butter1 Banana1 Tablespoon of Flax Seed Oil (if you're into that sort of thing, I think it actually enhances the flavor a bit and it's good for you)1-2 Cups of Ice (depending on how &#34;shakey&#34; you want it to be)Blend until smooth
