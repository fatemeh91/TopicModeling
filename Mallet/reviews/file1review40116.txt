review/text: The "sticky" mat is of good quality. You can put the mat on carpet, the fibers will not stick to it. The two blocks are very firm. I don't really see a use for the strap, but it's nice to have. The bag has about the quality of a plastic grocery store bag, but I did need a bag to carry my mat around.Comparing prices, I noticed that for a few extra dollars, you can get the blocks and bag(comparing to only purchasing the mat).All the items come in one skinny box.I am happy with my purchase.
