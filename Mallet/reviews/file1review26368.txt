review/text: This is NOT Elastikon tape. It is a similar, lower quality veterinarian tape. If you need it for your pet, great. If you want Johnson & Johnson Elastikon tape, this is falsely advertised (Elastikon is a trademark). They did send a postage paid return label, but I am still waiting for my refund.
