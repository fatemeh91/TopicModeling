review/text: So I have psoriasis on my scalp and a bit on my face. I was hoping from the reviews that this item would help clear it up. This however is not a cure, to it at all as some of the reviews might lead you to believe.This product is very much a lotion. However it does contain a lot of salt, so it is somewhat thick. When you apply it to affect areas, it helps slightly with the flaking of the skin. What I mean by this is that it basically keeps your skin from being so dry and helps with the cracking of the skin caused by psoriasis. In terms of reducing redness, it does not help. I guess you could also say this lotion can disinfect affect areas, since it does contain salt, which is good I guess.
