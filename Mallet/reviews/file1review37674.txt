review/text: I'm very satisfied with this product. It didn't leave my underarms sticky and it didn't stain my shirts. It has a pleasant smell, but yet not too strong. It did serve its purpose and kept me dry. I've found very few anti-perspirant/deodorants that I'm satisfied with, but I am satisfied with this product and I do believe I will purchase this brand in the future.
