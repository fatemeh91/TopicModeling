review/text: Unfortunately, I wasn't very impressed with this Rembrandt toothpaste. The first thing I noticed when I finished brushing my teeth was the distinctively bitter aftertaste (although, I'm pregnant and may be a bit more sensitive to flavors than most). I did see a slight improvement in my teeth's sensitivity to cold beverages, but I didn't see a great difference in the whiteness of my teeth. Not any more difference than with any other whitening toothpaste I've ever used (Crest, Aquafresh, Colgate, etc.). For the price and results, I wouldn't recommend this product to friends or family over any other whitening toothpaste for sensitive teeth. It was just okay.
