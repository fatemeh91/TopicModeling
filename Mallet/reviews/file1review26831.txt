review/text: I ordered this protein powder due to the great reviews and it seemed like what I needed. I ordered the Extreme Milk Chocolate flavor. I had no idea, however, that this product has artificial sweeteners. The first time I tried this product, I could taste the artificial sweeteners immediately. The "fake" taste and the way I felt after drinking it makes me regret buying this product. Quite a disappointment.
