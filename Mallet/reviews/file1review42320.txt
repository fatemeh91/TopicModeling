review/text: I was suffering from chronic fatigue for several years. In the past I have taken Nature's Plus capsules and have felt better. However, taking 6 pills a day was not very convenient. Last year I tried the liquid and found that for me it was a miracle drink. I have felt much better and my husband remarked that I no longer "nap all of the time". My physician mentioned that after menopause, absorbsion rates sometimes change, and perhaps the I absorb the liquid more effectively. Whatever the answer, I will continue taking the vitamin supplementthankscarol
