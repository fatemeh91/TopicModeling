review/text: Despite using regular insect repellents faithfully, when I was bitten by a tick for the first time I am aware of, I promptly came down with a whopping case of Lyme disease -- something I promise you you do NOT want to try at home. Shortly thereafter I learned about Bug Bands and read up on the science, the university and military studies and I switched to the Bug Band variety of lotions, sprays, bands, and beads (little bags of impregnated beads you can leave in the netting bags or disperse in a tent or elsewhere, usually in camp).As an 18th c. and Revolutionary War re-enactor, I am out in tall grass much of the year, but don't wish to re-live that little bit of authentic history again, believe me -- UGH! I have never seen a tick on me since and there are plenty at the venues we "play" in doing our little hobby. I see them often, but not on me and NOOOOOO bites!I trust Bug Bands and buy family packs for our grandkids and daughters/daughter-in-law too. We feel much better about the DEET-free ingredients as well, plus we rest more snugly at night knowing Bug Bands and beads are on duty as we sleep :) We could not recommend this line of insect repellent more highly -- If there was another star, we'd give it to them. Pleasant fragrance (not too strong); nice feel (not greasy, absorbs smoothly) too.
