review/text: I was really looking foward to using my gel mask, with it's happy, spongy feel. I froze it for a week until one day I needed it.It stayed cool for about twenty minutes. That was all. The fabric took on the small of my freezer.And then it fell apart. The stitching that held the outer cover onto the inner gel came unstitched. Not a great product.
