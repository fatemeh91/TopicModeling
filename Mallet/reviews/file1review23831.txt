review/text: It doesn't sag down on my calf, but it won't stay up on my thigh either so it ends up bunching up around my knee. Haven't really had it long enough to make too many other judgements but my first impression is about a 2 1/2 star impression. Take it or leave it. I'm sure there are better products out there.I've actually returned this item as the bunching up at the knee became more trouble than it was worth. Additionally, the mesh panel located behind the knee was uncomfortable and a huge irritation.
