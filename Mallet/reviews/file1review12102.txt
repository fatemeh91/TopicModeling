review/text: I couldn't take the after-taste of these vitamins. Although they are a ton better than most of the prenatal vitamins I had tested, they were still too much. I didn't mind them for the first few days but then I had a really hard time continuing with them. They're big horse pills and the thought of taking them made me gag (mostly thanks to my morning sickness). I did chew them but that was too much for my nauseous stomach over the course of a few days. I was very disappointed that they didn't work for me b/c it would be so much easier to just take one vitamin a day.I ended up getting a vegetarian gummy vitamin for kids called Yummi Bears Multi-Vitamin & Mineral. They're sour gummy vitamins that taste fruity/candy-like and are easy to eat. My doctor approved them at double the dose of a child (6 total).Sadly, each pregnant woman is different and so are our vitamin tolerance levels. If you're a newly pregnant mom with your first baby try to listen to your body... if you think this will be fine then try it... if you think this will make you sick then look for a different option. It will save you some money long-term (I've spent over $100 finding all of the wrong vitamins for my weak stomach). :-)
