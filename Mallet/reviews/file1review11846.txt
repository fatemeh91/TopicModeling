review/text: I have been using this product for about 5 months and find it to be the best tasting on the market. I have spent plenty of money on many different brands of protein and they are all thick, chalky, or down right gross.Champion is hands down the best tasting. I love the Champion Nutrition Pure Whey Stacked Chocolate flavored. It tastes like a chocolate Yoo-hoo, it also packs 26 grams of protein in a 5 ounce serving. I like mine "natural", mixing it with only water and ice.Having Lost 115 pounds following Gastric Bypass surgey, I need to get a maximum amount of protein each day in order to maintain my health and avoid surgery related malnutrition and hairloss. Today at 145 pounds, Champion makes it easy to maintain my weightloss and get my protein because it tastes so great.The Amazon market place seller The Vitimin Shoppe, has the best price online with shipping that is easy on the wallet. They sell the 5 pound tub for 23.99 with 4.99 shipping. As we all know there is the added security of ordering from an Amazon backed seller verses any one of the unknown internet sites that are out there.
