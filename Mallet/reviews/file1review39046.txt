review/text: I have done two hair cuts since my purchase of the Wahl Deluxe Hair Clipper Set. These clippers are a must have, if you have hair. They have paid for themselves already with just the two cuts. It is amazing how easy it is to get a great cut with little effort, even if your cutting your own hair. These are mistake proof easy to use clippers that work great, and you can't beat the price for performance. The CD I found helpful for hints, although others said it was no help. The cape is a throw-away, who cares? The sheers is what I paid for. You will love these clippers. It saves time, and most of all money.
