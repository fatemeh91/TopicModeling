review/text: The flip-up tabs on one the days came right off after my 3rd time flipping it up. Replaceable, right? Wrong, that's assuming the company responds to your (politely written, I might add) request to replace one of the sections. They never did. So, this review not only deals with the cheapness of their product, but also they're lack of customer service.
