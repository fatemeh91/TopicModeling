review/text: I ordered this to try out henna as I've always found it interesting and this cheap alternative to a professionally done one. The product can be a hassle. The application wasn't too difficult but you should prepare to have some time on your hands as it takes a while to dry. I don't know if it's because I didn't leave it on long enough but my henna tattoos came out more orange than the beautiful brown that shows up from the ones I've seen. Overall it was a "once in a lifetime" experience for me.
