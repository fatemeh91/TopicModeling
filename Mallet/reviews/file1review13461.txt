review/text: These razor blades are hard to find in the store and when you do they are far too expensive. These are the real things (not a knock off, I've tried that and they REALLY don't work) and at a good price. Fast delivery too. Why switch to a new razor with 3,4,5 blades. Just more expensive and doesn't shave any better. Thanks for making these still available.
