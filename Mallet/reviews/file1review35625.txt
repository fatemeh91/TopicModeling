review/text: This whitening cream uses hydroquinone which can have some bad side effects. I broke out overnight as soon as I tried it.It was awful! The breakout did not clear up for six months! It also gave me a bad chemical burn which made my skin flake and peel for a few weeks. I think I may be allergic to hydroquinone as some people are. Even if you aren't there are still some very bad side effects which is why it is banned (hydroquinone) as an otc ingredient from some countries. I have been hearing great things about another closely related ingredient named alpha-arbutin. It is supposed to deliver the same results but without the nasty side effects! There is a product named Meladerm which uses alpha-arbutin that is supposed to be very good but pricey! I'd rather pay that than risk another six month long pimple fest though! I think I'm going to give it a try.
