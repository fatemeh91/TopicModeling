review/text: I ordered this tennis elbow support as well as one by Mueller (Tennis Elbow Support, Black, One Size) from Amazon. I found this one, the Futuro, to be uncomfortable to wear for any length of time. I found the edges scratchy. The pad that goes over the affected area is somewhat crinkled and left marks on my arm after taking it off. The Mueller tennis elbow support is much more comfortable. I can wear it for hours. It too leaves some marks/indentations, but,oddly, is not uncomfortable to wear. I try and take the support off whenever I can and give my arm time to breathe and for the marks to go away, massaging that area of the arm. I tend to leave it off when I know I'm not going to lifting anything or in any way stressing that area-at home, sleeping, etc.
