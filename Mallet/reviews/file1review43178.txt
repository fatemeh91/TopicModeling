review/text: First off, this stuff does work. And it appears to be packed with less strange ingredients than my Scrubbing Bubbles or Tilex options.However, the smell is admittedly a little odd - like, mahogany and licorice, almost. And the spray handle broke in a week (which, judging from other Method products I've used, is probably a fluke, but something to note).
