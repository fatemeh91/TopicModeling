review/text: I'm a girl but got a free one of these in the mail. Omg it sucks so bad, which is weird because usually mens razors are superior to womens. The blades are extremely dull and I couldn't shave anything with it, the head is also small and cheap and doesn't contour to curves. I had to grab my months old Venus razor to finish the job because this razor just didn't shave well at all.
