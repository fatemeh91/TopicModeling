review/text: I purchased maximum strength Ascriptin online through Amazon. Typically I might pay less than $10 for this product either at the store or at another online site. However I haven't been able to find this product at all so I went through Amazon. They had the product but I paid $40! Highway robbery! Since this is the only product I can take that relieves my migraines I paid the fee but felt totally ripped off. Next time I will try another avenue.
