review/text: Of all of the pill organizers that we've tried, this is by far the best! Some of the pills that my Husband takes for his diabetes are quite large in size and I was very pleased at the ease of getting all of them into each compartment. It takes a bit to get used to having the square shape if you're used to putting the pills into one of the long straight pill holders, but it's well worth the adjustment. And the lids are nice and snug, so you don't have to worry about them coming open and your pills falling out either.
