review/text: I cannot believe I did not discover this protein powder sooner. I'm not a body builder, but I do like to finish my runs with a protein shake. I have no clue why I previously suffered through other various powders, but this one is a keeper. It's sweet, but not overwhelmingly so (just enough to satisfy my sweet tooth), and blends easily - A good 30-40 second shake in a bottle completely dissolves the powder. I most certainly look forward to trying the other flavors. On a more serious note: the composition is solid. It might not be perfectly suited for the beefy dudes, but as far as my needs go this fits the bill.
