review/text: I'm told by my nutritionist that if you do only one thing for your health, do this! This is an awesome immune system boost. I've been using it for a couple of years and rarely get sick. This has all the sea vegetables and probiotics you need. And it is NOT disgusting tasting. I put a packet of EmergenC and my scoop of Green Vibrance with some water and drink it fast so the effervescence from the EmergenC is still there and it's a really tasty morning drink. Helps with movements also -- if you know what I mean...;-)
