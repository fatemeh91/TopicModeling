review/text: I have always struggled cleaning my tea pot and my Nalgene water bottles. I would stuff washcloths into them and spin them around but I never felt like I was doing a good job. I saw this cheap little brush on amazon and figured I'd give it a go. This brush helps me all the time now. It can squeeze into the holes my hand can't fit in and I can move it around and scrub the insides. I am impressed with this brush and am very glad I found it.
