review/text: I have been a paramedic for 8 years. I have worked on countless cardiac arrest victims. The overall survival rate for victims of cardiac arrest is very low, but EVERY single person that we have successfully been able to revive has been through the use of a defibrilator. Though the comments made by a few others about proper medical care with medications hold some value, the definitive care for a patient in ventricular fibrillation (the most common initial electrical rhythm in cardiac arrest) is defibrilation. That is exactly what this product does. These type of products are essentially fool-proof. Anybody can learn to use one in less than 5 minutes. I strongly urge anyone reading this review to learn CPR and purchase this device. It may be several minutes before I can get to your home while your loved one is laying on the floor with no heartbeat. Give them the best chance of survival that you can.
