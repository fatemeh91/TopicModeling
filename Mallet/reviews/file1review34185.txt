review/text: If you're looking for a cure, then look elsewhere. Admittedly I don't think any ointment is going to cure "hemmoroids"... I think the only thing that has helped me to any extent has been a change of diet (stay away from refined carbs and sugars and fried greasy foods and eat more vegetables).Yes, this does soothe things - but you can also use witchhazel alcohol which is much cheaper (may sting a little though)...A good product, but not really a long term solution thing.
