review/text: This Nature's Way Cranberry tablets is an excellent product. I had chronic UTI's and yeast infections prior to using these tablets. My sister recommended it to me. Since taking one tablet a day, I am happy to say these problem issues have completely dissipated. I wish I knew about it years ago. What a difference it would have made for me.
