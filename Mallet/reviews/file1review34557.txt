review/text: My family and I have used this product in SE Alaska for roughly 5 years. I like that it has no DEET, and is still pretty effective. You may have to apply frequently in heavy conditions, but for most evenings around the yard/camping - a single covering will last several hours. We will continue to buy this product.We have heavy insect conditions up here, including no-see-ums, black flies, mosquitoes and white socks (which are vile biting creatures). This stuff has kept all of them from biting in most conditions (river fishing, camping, claming, playing on the beach or in the yard, hunting, etc.,) Although the bugs still buzz you, they do not bite for a while.Once, in a very heavy black fly and no-see-um attack (large swarms of bugs), I had to apply about every 45 minutes or so, but I was also sweating while working up fish, and getting lots of fish slime on me, whiping sweat (and product) from my brow...
