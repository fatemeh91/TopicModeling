review/text: One of the 3 bottles spilled all over the packaging. A second bottle lost some of the after shave liquid and the third bottle was unwrapped with the top popped off but maintained the most amount of liquid. The three bottles were tightly wrapped in bubble wrapping but no extra reinforcement was added to the bottle top that does not twist, pop, or lock on top of the bottle. When I repackaged the 2 remaining bottles for Christmas I made sure to tape the top on and wrap in skrink wrap to ensure a spillage would not occur again.
