review/text: For those that find the Fusion a good razor... I will sell you my blades for 90% off because I will be throwing them out. Its the worst razor by gillette ever! It causes razor bumps where no other gillette razor ever did this. I got hairs growing in about 5 hrs into the day where other razors kept me smooth all day. Mach 3 is the best gillette razor ever made. My girlfriend who shaves her legs with my razors refuses to use them again. They are that bad!
