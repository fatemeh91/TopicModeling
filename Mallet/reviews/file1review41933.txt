review/text: Arrived on time as part of a bulk package, like they literally snipped out the batteries from a larger blister pack because of the odd angles. But hey, how can I complain? I got it two days later with Amazon Prime and what more do you expect from a battery? I hate hunting for these random size batteries at the store so Amazon made it quick and easy to find this one, thanks!
