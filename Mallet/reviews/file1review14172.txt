review/text: I liked this lotion much better than the gel that Norelco included with the original purchase of my shaver. It is the same lotion that Norelco provides but by purchasing through Amazon I was able to save approximately 1/3 off the price that Norelco lists on their own website. This is an anomaly of the internet which I still cannot fathom. Why is it that we can get things cheaper from the middle men than we can from the manufacturer? Something is wrong with this and I'm just glad I can take advantage of someone.
