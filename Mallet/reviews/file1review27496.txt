review/text: Double rich chocolate is my favorite flavor by far. Tried the vanilla flavor but it tasted more medicine and chemical like than vanilla. Double rich chocolate, on the other hand, tastes exactly as it sounds. I've tasted just about every Chocolate whey protein powder out there and this one is by far the best tasting and it also mixes the best if you don't have time for a blender and you just shake it up. I mix mine with skim milk mostly. Also I sometimes put two tablespoons of peanut butter in it for extra calories because weight gain is a big focus for me right now. I think it tastes even better with the peanut butter btw. I like this protein a lot because of the high protein and low carbs and fat ration. When I'm in a bulking phase I just add the needed calories to the shake. When I'm cutting, this and water is the ideal protein shake to slim down quickly.I've been taking this for well over a year now and what first made me want to try it was because the reviews online were near perfect for this protein. Another reviewer mentioned something about adding Citrulline Malate powder into the shake. It is a body building supplement meant to reduce fatigue and recovery time and it turns out that it is very helpful in both those areas. I've stopped taking creatine a while ago because I hate feeling bloated. The Citrulline seems to mirror the gains I get when I use to take creatine so I would recommend it for anymore looking to gain strength/mass in the gym too.Overall, ON has a great Protein product and as long as they don't change the ingredients or something crazy like that, I will continue to buy.
