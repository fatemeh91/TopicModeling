review/text: This product is nice. It does a great job for the price. It is kind of noisy but it does work wonders! The down side and reason for 4 stars is that the pedicare spot is very small and hard to use. You have to contort yourself into very akward positions to use it. It is almost to much unless you are very flexible. The bubbles and vibrations are just right. Like I said it is a little noisey but not sure how others compare. I would recommend it and buy it again for the price. It is worth the money and has a nice 2 year warrenty which is odd in this day and age. If you are buying it for the pedicure I would recommend you look at something else as this isn't the best product for that. As I said the way the features are positioned they are hard to use. Other than that it is a good product for the price.
