review/text: I was excited to try this product especially reading that it helps in absorption of foods after having the gallbladder removed.I took these as it said on the label, however, I had some serious adverse reactions to these. They made me sick to my stomach as though I had diarrhea. Perhaps the strength was too strong for me, but I threw these out! Perhaps I will try the one's that are 125mg.
