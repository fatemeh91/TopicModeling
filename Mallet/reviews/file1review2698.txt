review/text: This product was no different that Eros Original, with which we were unsatisfied. There are beter silicone-based lubes to be had. Highly recommend Wet Platinum instead. It's superior in all regards and is of the quality I was expecting Pjur Eros Origiinal to be. The interesting thing is that a small sample of Wet Platinum arrived with the Pjur Eros order, or I would never have known about it. Wet Platinum can be found at staywetlonger dot com, among other places.
