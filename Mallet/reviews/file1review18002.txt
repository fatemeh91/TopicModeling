review/text: I like it. I think it would be impossible to get this sort of thing perfect b/c at the end of the day you're putting a strap around your head. I think this is probably more thin than most though. You have to really tighten the strap too to keep every bit of light out but im not too picky so I didnt have to tighten it all the way. Velcro is very strong and stays. I did find it bothersome when the strap was behind my ears so I just put it over my ears and problem solved. I didnt feel a bump lying on my back but again I'm not very picky. I mostly sleep on my side as well.
