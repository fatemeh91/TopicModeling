review/text: After taking this I've noticed a difference in my skin improving. I've had fewer break outs and has been great for my vision as well. When at the range and focusing on the 300 meter target, it hasn't been as blury. It was always hard to focus in on, up to this point. That was after taking this product for about 3 months.If you aren't taking this as directed by a doctor, then at least look up the facts from a credible source. One thing that I've noticed is that when I take this before going to bed, I have very vivid dreams. Almost to the point of being lucid. That might be a common side effect.
