review/text: I had the previous Norelco introductory model for about two years. The rechargeable batteries, as others have noted, wore out rather quickly. I only use a trimmer about five months of the year and only a few times a week so I didn't really use the trimmer enough to justify it dying so quickly.Thinking this was all just a quirk, I bought this new model to replace the one I threw out. It was a total waste of money!The biggest issue is the lack of power in the motor. This thing, even when fully charged, will PULL the hair off your face if you trim too quickly. The blades just aren't moving fast enough. If you trim slowly you're OK. If you're in a hurry and trim quickly you're in for a painful surprise. I never had this problem with the previous model or any other beard trimmer for that matter.The second issue I have is with the trimmer head which they supposedly "improved" from the previous model. The new head is this delicate flap that goes up and down as you turn the dial. If you don't treat your trimmer delicately (and who does?) and throw this thing in your shaving kit or luggage you just might find that you've broken this small piece of plastic and thus made your trimmer completely worthless. I also found the new head to be very poor at keeping a unified level in my beard, something that really wasn't a problem before.Norelco has lost my business. The next trimmer I buy will be from another company. Based on many positive reviews here on Amazon it looks like Remington has some good models.
