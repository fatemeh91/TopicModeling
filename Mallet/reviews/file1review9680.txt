review/text: I had a lot of fun with these distinctive glasses from the very first day. Everyone noticed. Nearly everyone had a comment. Most people liked them. The style is low riding for lots of clarity below when reading yet easy to look over the top of if they are down on your nose just a bit. The tortoise coloring is very dark so is more of an accent than an attraction. Also, although you can't really tell from the picture, the nose bridge is a double arch that adds to the cool look. If you are into something a little different and don't want to be ordinary, these fit the bill. The price to quality ratio is just fine.
