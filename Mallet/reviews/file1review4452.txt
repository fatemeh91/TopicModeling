review/text: I've used Fusion razors for a number of years, and continue to be amazed by the virtually total lack of nicks, even with shavers that have been used for months. There was controversy awhile back, with some Amazon customers questioning the authenticity of the Fusion packages. I find these units deliver the same repeated close shaves as those I've bought in the past, online, and elsewhere.Some reviewers have stated that three blade shavers offer the same advantages for a lower price, and while I cannot comment on that assertion, I can say with assurance that Fusion razors are incomparably better than any one or two blade model I've tried.
