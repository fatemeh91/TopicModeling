review/text: I'm glad to see they're available on Amazon. I didn't give it a 5 as I still having tearing issues. My optometrist recommended. It has helped better than anything else. I'm really amazed that in all the years I've suffered from this problem, there really isn't much out there. But a little something is better than nothing.
