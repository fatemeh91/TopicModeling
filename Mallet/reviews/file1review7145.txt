review/text: This is the third Wahl shaver that I have purchased. It does what it is designed to do, very well. The case of the new model is not as substantial as the older models; the fit of the parts is not very precise, however, it shaves just as good as earlier models. It is probably not worth the MSR but it can be found at a discount.
