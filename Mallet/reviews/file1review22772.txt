review/text: +++BACKGROUNDJust a little info about myself: I am a 5'7" male, the day before I started taking this I weighed in at 160.6 lbs. 13% body fat. My chest was 36". Arms 12.5". Hips 35". Waist 33.3". Thighs 21.5". Calves 14.5". Forearms 10". Shoulders 45.8". Neck 15.5". To measure these stats I used bodyspace.com's methods (explained in the videos) to be sure that my measuring was consistent.My diet was 1600cals: 160g of protein/day, 160g carbs/day, 35g fat/day, 25g fiber, 2500mg sodium/day, and 35g sugar/day (typically lactose with the exception of flavored greek yogurt post workout). I was VERY religious about sticking to this. A couple days I would go over/under in particular categories, but I was very consistent tracking this information.My supplement schedule was as follows: 06:00--5g glutamine. 06:20--Animal cuts. 06:30--lift. 07:30--10g creatine, 2 fish oil pills, 1 gnc mega men energy & metabolism vitamin. 11:15--Animal cuts. 18:00--1 fish oil pill, 1 more gnc vitamin, 22:30--5g glutamine. This routine worked well for my schedule.My workout routine was: Monday--Chest, Tuesday--Upper Back/Shoulders, Wednesday--rest, Thursday--Bicep/Tricep, Friday--Lower Back/Legs, Sat/Sun--rest. Worked out for 1 hour each day, and didn't even lift a finger on rest days. Also, I would like to note that I did not do ANY cardio whatsoever while I was on animal cuts. I loathe cardio. I would rather hit the weights and eat less.+++REVIEW STARTS HERE...OK, now that the background info is out of the way, it's time to get to the actual product review.First, the taste was so disgusting. I am really surprised I was able to down these pills 42 times. Sick! It reminds me of taking a tea bag and lodging it in my throat 18 times a day (once for each pill). The pills were difficult for me to swallow, and were coated with a horrendous substance. Honestly, I would rather take the cinnamon challenge than down these pills.Second, I would get so sick if I did not eat prior to taking Animal Cuts. I felt as though I could vomit at any second. This would subside as soon as I took 1 bite of food. I would literally bite off a small piece of bread crust and it would make my stomach feel better. So I learned after the first couple of days to eat 20mins before I take this.Third, this works incredibly well. I had been on a cut for about 6 weeks before taking this, and in the 3 weeks I was on this my body transformed completely. At 11-12% body fat my abs were much more visible. Years ago, I used to weigh 143lbs at 7% body fat and my abs were not nearly as clear-cut. I'm guessing this is the result of the diuretic which removes subcutaneous water. I got compliments every time I talked to someone I hadn't seen in a couple weeks. I could see muscle striations, and veins that were never visible before.Fourth, I didn't notice any extra peeing. I drank 16-20 (8 oz)glasses of water a day before I took animal cuts, so I peed like crazy both on and off this supplement. Another thing, I coupled this with creatine (which pulls water into muscles to increase ATP for muscle recovery) and I did not have any problems. I know some people advise against this (since the diuretic is supposed to decrease subcutaneous water), but, as I stated, it worked fine for me-- just drink plenty of water.After the three weeks of taking this product I took measurements again:Chest 37" (+1"). Arms 12.25" (-.25"). Hips 33.75" (-1.25"). Waist 32.5" (-.8"). Thighs 21" (-.5"). Calves 14.25" (-.25"). Forearms 9.75" (-.25"). Shoulders 46.25" (+.45"). Neck 15.3" (-.2").156.4lbs (-4.2lbs). and 10% body fat (-3%).Finally, I'm not sure if I will take this again. Honestly, every day I would dread taking Animal Cuts because it tasted so freaking awful. If I were going on a cruise in the next month I might consider taking it again so that my wife would not be embarrassed to be seen with me. But I have no good reason for making myself endure that taste twice a day for three weeks. Perhaps if I was used to taking so many nasty pills it might've not been quite as bad?+++SUMMARY: It does what it claims, but tastes horrible.4 out of 5 stars from me. But for someone who needs to cut quickly for one reason or another, definitely try this product.
