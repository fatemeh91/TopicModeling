review/text: It took quite a while to find a cleaner I could safely use on my wood laminate floor.I am pleased with Bona for the most part and like that it is gentle and safe for pets. I wish it had just a bit more muscle for spots, but if you clean 2 x in that area it will take up the spot on the second try.I order it from Amazon & have found it to the best price anywhere.
