review/text: This is not a laxative to use casually, but when your child is having clinical constipation it works very well. Unlike a stool softener, this laxative will loosen the stool but also help your child 'push' it out. I agree with a previous review that if possible, use diet changes such as increased fruit and fruit juices -- or decreased dairy, bananas, apples, white bread and potatoes -- before relying on a laxative. Though when diet changes alone don't work, this can be used and it is very effective. Do not overuse unless a doctor recommends because your child can become dependent on it if used for a long period of time.
