review/text: Motion Ease absolutely delivers on what it promises. We cruised the Florida Keys and Mexico with no problems at all. I used it from the minute I stepped on board the ship, but my husband who was only feeling a bit queasy one day, put it on and in less than 5 minutes was feeling 100% OK. I would highly recommend this product especially because it's safe for all ages and since it's not ingested, you don't have to worry about interactions with other medications.
