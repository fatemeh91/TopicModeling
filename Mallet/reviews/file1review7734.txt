review/text: This is a great massager for the price. The only issue I have with it are the extra attatchments. You may as well toss them. The basic spa however is a divine treat. Just what I was hoping for. A hot tub for your tired toes. It bubbles and massages. The jets are strong enough to feel really good.No complaints here!
