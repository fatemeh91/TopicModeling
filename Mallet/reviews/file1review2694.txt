review/text: The bottom line is this is just silicon lubricant liquid.Similar to spray silicon used in industry to lubricate with.My wife says this stuff irritates her the same amount as Astroglide or K-Y.This stuff FEELS really, really, really good to me.It also LASTS longer than Astroglide, or probably anything else out there.Worth trying if you are looking for something different.
