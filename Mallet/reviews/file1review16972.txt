review/text: I retract my primarily favorable review that I wrote after using the trimmer a couple of times. In the 5th month I was unable to locate the recharger (it uses an unconventional pin that inserts into the base of the trimmer). I finally located it, and it's apparently been charging (i.e., the green light is on) for two days. However, to no effect. The unit is completely dead.This is a shaver available at a number of places on the internet at prices ranging from $15 to $60. Since I didn't play the latter for it, I'm disinclined to go to the bother and time of having it repaired. It was wasted money.Even though the Remington is more precise that the Panasonic it replaces, the Panasonic had an ingenious rechargable plug that jack-knifed open from the base, permitting the entire shaver to be inserted in the AC and ensuring against loss of AC connection. I would look for either that feature or go with regular battery-operated (a permanently connected electrical cord is also worth considering).Obviously, I got a lemon, or a bad charger. Nevertheless, best not to spend more than $10 on these and to regard them as disposable--more potentially irritating gadgetry in our cluttered lives.
