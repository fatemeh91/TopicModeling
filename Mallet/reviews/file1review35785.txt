review/text: My son changed formulas at about 5 months, and thank goodness we had these!! I don't know what studies show, but these made a definite difference then, and as he started to try new foods.I haven't tried other drops, but have seen that some are pink, this is a nice milky white color, which not only doesn't stain, but in my mind means the other must use some sort of coloring. They smell nice and fruity and my son doesn't seem to mind the taste. When our first bottle started to get low, I immediately went out to get more, and noticed how much more expensive some of the other brands were.
