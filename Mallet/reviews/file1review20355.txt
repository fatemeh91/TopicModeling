review/text: I bought several of these to clean my glasses and shiny electronics such as my cell phone and computer. They are not as soft as what you would get at an optical or glasses shop - they have a very finished feel to them, more like polyester, less like silk. I think they may have even put slight scratches on my cell phone. Tried two different clothes. Unfortunately, not recommended, even though the company was very helpful and shipped fast.
