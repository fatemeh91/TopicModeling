review/text: This gadget is great, it cuts close and does the job efficiently and quietly with no cuts or pain. Do not try it for purposes other than grooming nose or ear hair. Ugh! And if someone gives this to you as a gift in front of a crowd of people, this person is not your friend, but even so, look in that mirror and if you need it, use it, do us all a favor and yourself most of all. This gadget does a much better job than scissors or other little shavers. This is state of the art. I am not a sasquatch so a battery lasts months for me.Update January 2006- I am seeing a basic conflict in reviews posted after mine. Perhaps Panasonic has made its product cheaper. I haven't had any trouble at all with my unit. It works first time, every time, and I have only changed the AA battery Once since I have owned the machine. It does not hurt when the hairs are cut. It cuts the hair down, it does not pull it out. There may be a spate of defective products out there. I would suggest buying it at a place where there is a warranty in force. How about Sears where everything is guaranteed or your money refunded?
