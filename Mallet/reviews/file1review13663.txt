review/text: I have a cedar mop for over 2 years. And bought the refill from Dept, Store, last us 2-3 years but just was too dirty.This refill we received was immediately unraveling at the seam of the garter after ONE use. I expected that this productwas going to be the same as my old one because it is made by CEDAR too.I have to use my old one and just maybe look around at dept store.again.The product has a very poor quality and workmanship.
