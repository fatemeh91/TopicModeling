review/text: I received this fountain as a gift. It worked wonderfully but the pump is so loud it overwhelms the sound of the falling water and the pre-programmed ambient tones. It developed a biofilm over all surfaces in contact with water despite weekly cleanings that were none to easy, too many small nooks and crannies for bacteria to hide.
