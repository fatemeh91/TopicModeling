review/text: Met Rx carries a wonderful line of high protein...low carb...no sugar bars. They are perfect as meal replacements or protein supplements. The creamy cookie crisp is my favorite flavor. IT has only 340 calories and is absolutely delicous. It doesn't taste like a diet bar at all. No guilt because it has little sugar and a lot of protein. It tastes sweet, crunchy, and very filling.
