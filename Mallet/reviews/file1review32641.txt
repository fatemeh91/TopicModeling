review/text: I have been using Acai Powder and acai frozen berries for close to a year and I love it. I mix the powder into my yogurt drink or make a smoothie out of the powder or frozen berries mixed in with other fruit, and other fruit juices such as apple. Very good! Since we've moved to Prescott, Az. I don't have a local store that carries this product but was very pleased to find it on line thru Amazon and for a better price. Delivery was fast too!! Thank you once again Amazon, I don't know what I would do without you for many things!!!
