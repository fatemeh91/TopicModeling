review/text: These vitamins are very good.MOST important thing I wanted to mention is there is NO!!! vitamin aftertaste after taking them. Along with being very complete vitamins that are cost effective. I have taken them two days in a row, on an empty stomache with NO stomach ache,or aftertaste.........WONDERFUL! :-)
