review/text: A few years back my health had a temporary setback that had me dependent upon a wheelchair. I was also traveling to see specialists and needed something that could fold up quickly and compactly to fit in either a car or on a plane. The Airgo Navigator can fold up just small enough to fit in the overhead compartment of airplane which means you never have to be separated from your own personal equipment. Fits easily in a trunk of a car as well.Folding it does take some practice and having a couple of your own bungee cords or velcro straps is advisable to keep things *tight*. It's a bit like getting a tent back in its bag and for me required 3 or 4 tries to get it down pat; not especially difficult but I'd say it definitely requires practicing a few times to get it right so you can perform this action quickly if necessary.Other features I like: you can add footrests and flip the backrest into position to have someone push you in "wheelchair mode".You can adjust the seat and backrest to use as a rollator in "walker mode".You always have a seat with you.There is a basket to carry small items under the seat and/or store the footrests on board.Last, but still of some importance for me is that the titanium color - looks great!This model is built for getting around efficiently and compactly; it really is not meant for sitting in for long periods of time so if this is to be a primary wheelchair I would suggest looking into models that are made more for that purpose.This was the best investment in compact versatile mobility I could have made. A sturdy, well constructed rollator+transport chair.Pleased to recommend!
