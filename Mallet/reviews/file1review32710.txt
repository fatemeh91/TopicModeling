review/text: Milk Chocolate Peanut. My only favorite. I've been eating the same kind of slim fast bar every day for the last 10 yrs. Not just because of weight problems, it's healthy and convenient as well.The reason I gave 3 stars is because of how the product arrived. I thought finally I found an easy convenient and cheap way to get my every day breakfast... Well, I received my slim fast which was probably exposed to heat for a long time because it looks BAAAD! It looks really bad and when I open it all the chocolate pieces are falling all around my desk. It's gross.I don't know if I am gonna give another chance for them. I don't know if I just received a "defective" package this one time. I'll think about it.
