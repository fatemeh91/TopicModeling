review/text: I've been taking 3 tablets a day for a couple of months now and I can't tell any difference between now and when I first started taking them. Once I run out, I won't be buying anymore. While there might be some advantage to taking these, I'm either not aware of the changes or my body is metabolizing these out of my system before they can take effect.
