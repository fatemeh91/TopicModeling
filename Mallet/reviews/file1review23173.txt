review/text: Great item for the money. Yes, my handle fell off, too. I taped it on. No biggie. It does pick up surface pet hair - I was concerned when I saw reviews saying it didn't pick up pet hair. I love it because it effectively picks up visible hair - I then use my vacuum to deep clean. For a quick spruce up, you can't beat this sweeper. I wouldn't want to do without it now.
