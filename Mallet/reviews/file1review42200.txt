review/text: My Mom developed shingles on her forehead, scalp and then her eye in early August. Though the vesicles have dried up, she continues to suffer from the searing pain and unrelenting itching from the post-herpetic neuralgia. No meds have helped, and other topical treatments have caused adverse reactions. This is the VERY FIRST product that has provided relief. It is a Godsend.Actually, the product she used was the Peaceful Mountain Shinglederm Rescue (not the Plus formulation). Haven't tried this variety yet.
