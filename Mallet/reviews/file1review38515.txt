review/text: I was skeptical....what is this funny little device called a heated eyelash curler? It doesn't look like any eyelash curler I've ever seen before. It doesn't crimp your lashes like the traditional curler. Yes, it takes a lttle longer than the crimper, just a minute total will do it, and it does truly last all day. When I get home from work, at 6 or 7 in the evening, my lashes are still in top form. This is a great addition to your beauty collection. I recommend it highly!
