review/text: I had always taken the "clean-shaven" route but recently decided to keep some stubble on my face. I tried using a cheap Remington body hair trimmer for a little while, but it was not working out. I read a lot of reviews and decided to give this one a try. I found out after I ordered that the shortest setting is 1.5mm, and I was a little bit worried that that wouldn't be short enough. When the trimmer arrived, I first tried it on setting #2 to be safe. Here are my thoughts:I am overall very impressed with this trimmer. After being worried that setting #1 (1.5mm) would be too long, it turns out that setting #2 is just the right length for a good "stubble" look. I haven't tried it on #1 yet, but I can't imagine that not being short enough for somebody. I'd compare #2 to about 2-3 days of not shaving, and by the looks of things, #1 seems like it would trim quite a bit shorter. So, if you need shorter than #1 then you should probably just clean shave at night and you will be happy the next day.I was also very happy with the comb and location of the trimming blades toward the "front" of the comb. The comb allows for very easy following of facial contours and the position of the trimming blades makes it easy to trim all the way up to the nose. The result is a good, same-length trim that takes just a couple of minutes. The zoom wheel is very easy to use and it does not seem that the comb will accidentally push down once a setting is chosen.I cannot comment on battery life yet as I have only used the trimmer once when I just got it, and I kept it plugged in.
