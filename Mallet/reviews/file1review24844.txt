review/text: I had high hopes for this product, but I have to join in with those who said it threw their cycle into a tailspin. My husband had motility issues, but for good measure I thought I would take these supplements while we were TTC. I was regular and took this supplement for about three months before my cycle completely seemed to stop. I was very excited because I thought I was pregnant, but no. When I told my doctor that I had missed my period twice with negative results on pregnancy tests, she said to stop taking the supplements immediately, but I still missed my period for two more months. What's in that stuff?! I can't personally recommend this to others based on my experience. :-(
