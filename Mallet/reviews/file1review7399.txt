review/text: The purpose I purchased this battery was to be ready to replace the old one. The charge life was becoming low and I knew it was a matter of time before I would need a replacement.Just within the last few days, the inevitable happened and I was ready with the "new" battery. I was aware it would need to be recharged before use and let it charge for about two days as I didn't need to use my camera. When I did use it, it barely held the charge long enough to snap a few photos before the warning light appeared.Thinking it was new and might need a "breaking-in" period, I recharged it again for a few days and received the same result. I believe it is either defective or too old, but I have no way to tell for sure which it is. It may be both.I have always had good luck with Fuji, so I am giving them a little slide on rating this product for that reason alone.
