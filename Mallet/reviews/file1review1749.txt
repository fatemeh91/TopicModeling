review/text: I bought this product based on other reviewers liking it to banish fungal foot problems. I started taking yoga class at the gym twice a week and, after the 1st week, noticed a peeling toes! They were mostly peeling at the tips where you place them on the mat for downward dog. Anyway, I was grossed out since I usually do not have athlete foot problems. So I used this for 2-3 days in a row and then a couple times a week after yoga class once the problem cleared up. And you do not need much, use a few drops on a nail brush for each foot and start scrubbing the fungus away. It has a strong tea tree scent, but I like, and I know it is working and it dissipates in a few minutes. It's worth it! It's also worth to clean the yoga mat periodically to get rid of the fungus from the nasty gym floor.
