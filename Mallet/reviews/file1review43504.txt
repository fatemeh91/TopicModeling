review/text: Somehow a good friend had two of these monitors. Two weeks ago I checked my BP on a pharmacy type machine and my BP was getting borderline. I talked to him about it and he said, hey, I've got a spare, it's yours.I have been using it and getting worried so I took it to my doctors office today to check the accuracy.Omron HEM-711 159/88Doctor's BP cuff 142/72 (nurse also used stethoscope)This is a highly rated unit and I love it. But no matter, ratings are useless if it isn't accurate. Please check it at your doctors office when you receive it(they are used to these things being off). If it's not accurate send it back. It's your choice whether to try again.
