review/text: I never leave the house without a couple of this nifty little pre-moistened towelettes tucked away in my purse. One just never knows when a sin will take you by surprise, so it is always good to be prepared.If you are like me, then public restrooms, door handles, shopping carts, and other grimy things encountered outside the home are a threat to the sanctity and sanity of your being. You'll discover that these hand wipes are a convenient blessing for restoring your sense of well being.They are plenty large and moist enough for a thorough cleaning of both sides of the hands, all ten digits (back, front, and in between), under fingernails, and all the way up to the elbows if needed. Also, they have a refreshing light scent and are non-drying to your skin.Like all the Wash Away Your Sins items, these towelettes have been tested and approved for all seven deadly sins. I don't know if this is guaranteed or not but I don't want to be the one to find out.
