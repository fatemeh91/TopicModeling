review/text: Over all I really like this Water Pik. Two things are not so nice. First: If the hand piece is in it's holder when you put the tank on to use, you can't get it out without removing the full tank from the unit. Second: The tank is the cover for the unit when not in use, With the hand unit in it's holder and the tip in place, the tank (cover) does not work unless you remove the tip first (Bummer). However the added capacity of the tank makes the unit well worth having.
