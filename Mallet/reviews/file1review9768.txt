review/text: I bought these tweezers not for tweezing splinters and the like. I bought these to weed vinyl stickers.I recently purchased a vinyl plotter so I can make my own vinyl decals. I needed a good set of tweezers to weed out the unwanted vinyl from cut designs, and the sharp point on these tweezers work perfectly, especially with very complex designs.
