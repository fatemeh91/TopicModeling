review/text: This product seems to go straight to your muscles. Women, be careful because taking this and working out might give you the arms of a man. It's great stuff, no close second.Take it on an empty stomach - soothes even an upset stomach. Take when ill, take when working out. Take before a risky sport to keep yourself safer.I tend not to take anything *every* day, but if I did, this would be it.
