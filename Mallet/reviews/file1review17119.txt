review/text: I had an old model just like this where the battery worked well and took a charge for years and years of use until it finally died. I could not find a new battery for it, so I got this one. This model from the very first time I used it had a horrid battery life. A full overnight charge would decay in hours and barely give a full trim - if any trim at all. I can't rate this low enough as it is useless with the no good battery - even with the charger cord plugged in at the same time you are using it.
