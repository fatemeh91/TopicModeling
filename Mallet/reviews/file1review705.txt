review/text: This is the perfect present for anyone..especially good for those who already have everything. I got them for my entire family this Christmas. From the oldest to youngest, they were a hit. Just odd enough to be fun, but practical enough to get used. And after 12 hours of use, they just throw them away, so you haven't created any useless clutter. (Get yourself a set too.)
