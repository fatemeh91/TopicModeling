review/text: These are great condoms: extremely thin and very durable.The only general flaw that I can point to is my belief that they are somewhat under-lubricated. Other than that, I think the circumcised man would be quite hard pressed to find anything better. These are widely used by adult performers for a reason.However, the lack of lube and the snug average fit of these is a bit of a detriment to me, primarily due to having an uncircumcised penis. The restriction of motion inside the condom lead to instances of the condom being trapped between the foreskin during use, which is not entirely unpleasant but is distracting and suboptimal. Extra lube helps a lot, but is still not ideal.For those readers that are not cut, I highly recommend the12 Durex Maximum Love Condoms NEW! Larger and Thinner Condom for more Sensitivity and Sensation. These have a bulbous head and ample lube, to really maximize your experience.
