review/text: I got this tub for my baby since we have an apartment and no extra room and I liked that it folds for storage. That is my favorite feature... I usually fold it up and tuck it behind the bathroom door. The foam lining is nice... I feared it would peel up or break where it bends to fold but it's held up just fine. I like the plug feature... it makes emptying the tub very easy and it's completely leak-proof. Because of the folding feature, however, you can overfill the tub without realising it. There is VERY LITTLE water in the tub when it's at its limit, which is fine for my baby who prefers cool baths and fresh air. If your baby has to stay really warm and covered, he will not like this tub. The first few baths I filled the tub to what I thought was a reasonable level and didn't realize that the puddle I had to clean up afterwards was from overflowing. My baby does not like the recline... she would be happier if it wasn't laid back so far, but that could just be her preference. I wish there was a curve to the back so she couldn't slide around as much... it's very hard to keep her head from sliding to the side of the tub and resting on the hard corner. I use washcloths to try to keep her upright. Overall, this is a very serviceable tub. It does the job and doesn't cost much or take up tons of space. There is lots of room for improvement but it's fine for a $10 tub!
