review/text: This is my go to protein for the great mix of price and quality. The taste isn't too too strong and mixes very well into smoothies and water. I generally use it two - three times a day 4-5 times a week. I've been noticing gains with the protein and I think that it is a solid entry level protein. There are proteins out there with higher quality protein (i.e. whey isolate as opposed to whey concentrate) but they are much pricier. This option is reliable and tasty... but not delicious (-1 star)
