review/text: Having been given a nice Williams and Sonoma Bamboo chopping board, I set out to find the right treatment for it. Mineral oil is the usual answer but it is difficult to find in stores. I bought this oil after seeking it out on Ask.com and it is a very good product. it is light, flavor and odorless, and easily applied with great results.
