review/text: This is a very good product.I have a son of 4 years and a half.He uses this since 1 year ago.I have noticed that he does not get sick as often as he did, mostly related to stomach problems.He used to have issues, such as if i give him soup for 2 days in a raw and the soup contained tomatoes then he gets problems with the stomach.I was also afraid of allowing him to eat anything that was not prepared in my house.Now he can eat more things than he used to and I feel more relaxed when i decide his meal.It is really great.Also I have notices he does not vomit as often as he did, in the car at long travels.I have also used it for some days when I had stomach problems and got back well very very soon.He uses it daily, i only take a spoon when i feel bad, because it is so expensive in my country. Amazon has a very good price
