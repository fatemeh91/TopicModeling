review/text: So, I had abused my heels with wearing flip flops, going barefoot around the house and we used to have Berber carpeting, so I think the constant scratching of the abrasive Berber didn't do my feet any favors. I had tried everything. I also hate wearing socks and shoes and don't want to wear socks at night either. I had dry heels and cracks were appearing everywhere on both feet. I tried a pumice stone and typical lotions, without any results. I was concerned enough to not want to have it continue, otherwise I'd need an appointment with a podiatrist.I had read that urea was helpful for dry, rough heels and this product contains urea, amongst others. I used this product morning after my shower after drying my feet well. Then at night, hit or miss, before bedtime as well. It took about 3 weeks of use, but now my heels look fantastic and healthy. All the dryness is gone! The cracks are almost all totally healed as well.I used the Mr Pumice (purple bar) gently under running water with gentle cleanser, then dried my feet well and applied the Dr. Scholls to my heels. Voila!I'll never be without this product again. Give it time. I'm sure if you do the nighttime routine w/socks, it may work faster for you.One cannot afford to get infections, so by keeping your heels healthy, it equates to overall health and might save you a trip to the doc.
