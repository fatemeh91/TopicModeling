review/text: I always struggled with the use of preworkout supplements in the past, particularly before going to MMA training. I struggled in the sense that I couldn't go without them because I felt that they gave me a necessary edge over my competition. Now I just take this stuff along with a cup of coffee before training, and consequently I feel a million times better than I did when taking preworkout supplements. I am now able to spend a very long time on the bag, then immediately begin full contact sparring. In the past, I would always begin feeling weak and simply horrible by the time sparring began. Thanks to this stuff, I feel as if I could go all day. Seriously. I don't think it's placebo.
