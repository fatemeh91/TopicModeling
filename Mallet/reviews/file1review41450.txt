review/text: I found out only by accident that this is the ONLY thing which completely treats my reflux issues. I took it originally more to relax myself due to some other supplements and prescription drugs, but this was an amazing, amazing side effect that's taken me from someone who felt barely able to go on to never thinking of reflux again. I've not seen any literature on this, but every time I stop taking it a few days my reflux starts up like clockwork, making it pretty obvious it's having a deep effect on me.I also find it lifts my mood and possibly enhances concentration a bit. These effects can vary a lot from person to person but for the reflux issue several people I've turned to ashwaghanda have had the same results I have. It seems to act on the GABA system and that is possibly where the help for reflux comes from, in addition to its known ability to help with anxiety and social phobia.The 1fast400 brand is half the price per gram and works about the same, but it doesn't have capsules and though I'm used to it very few people can handle a strong herb like this without capping it first. For a capped brand, this seems the best you can do, though.
