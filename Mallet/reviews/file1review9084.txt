review/text: A little back history about myself. I am a 80's born asian male. All throughout my years in high school my face was smooth as a babies butt! I had no issues with acne until I started college. I then slowly started breaking out with acne. These were some of the worst years of my life. My acne was beyond bad at one stage, my face was literally purple and red from the massive breakouts and scars. I was socially mortified! Not to mention I have tried numerous (name your beauty product) products in attempts to fix my face. It would help temporarily but still I would have sporadic breakouts.Fast forward to June 2011 I am still having seldom breakouts even at this age! My buddy introduces me to green vibrance. He mixed a cup of cranberry juice with a scoop of green vibrance powder. The taste wasn't to bad.. (I actually enjoy drinking this every morning now.) He was telling me how there were so many nutritious greens and how healthy it was. I was sold and purchased my own tub on amazon and have been taking it religiously every morning (30 mins) after breakfast.I am writing this August 10th 2011.I and everyone I know has noticed that my face has cleared up significantly in the two months I have taken green vibrance. So apparently I had some internal digestive issues which was causing my breakouts. I believe green vibrance has 'fixed' me! I haven't been this clear since, I can't even remember!!I am thrilled to share my story! Cheers to Green Vibrance!Update August 29th 2012:I am pleased to report that I no longer have breakouts. I began taking green vibrance daily starting from June 2011 till December 2011. I am still taking scoops of this at seldom, not daily like before. I feel great and face looks wonderful. I wish I had found out about green vibrance earlier in my life.
