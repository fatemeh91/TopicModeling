review/text: I recently broke my first Baldfader (my fault) and didn't hesitate a second when buying the same model as a replacement. I've heard nothing but good word of mouth about Wahl Clippers, and Baldfader hasn't let me down.It has a solid, sturdy construction. Without a gaurd, I easily get down to the equivalence of ~2 day's growth after a straight shave. The professional head and blade don't nick my skin or give me problems with the teeth and blades binding up when cutting a lot of hair (I had this problem with other Clippers). Although my hair is fairly thin and I don't do anything fancy with my Baldfader, I'm very happy using my it for thorough, even shaves.Although I suspect there may be better Wahl Clippers out there, Baldfader has exceeded all of my expectations, especialy considering such a reasonable price point.
