review/text: Great exercisor! I was beginning to have some prolapsing that is normal for my age and timing with perimenopause, etc. This really helps tighten the pelvic muscles and without going into too much detail, the muscles which helps "hold everything in" and prevent leakage and accidents. In just over a week you will definately see results if used consistantly and properly. Don't be afraid to try something like this. It is difficult to discuss and admit to a problem, so buying online and using resources here is a godsend. Arrived super fast. Highly recommend!! Worth every penny and more!!
