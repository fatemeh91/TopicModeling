review/text: I used this together with Muira Puama which is commonly recommended. This is primarily promoted for libido enhancement and energy. I suppose if you have low libido and low energy this might work for you, but I naturally already have high libido and energy and just wanted to see if it could even make those better. It doesn't -- in fact it works the opposite: I'm much more sleepy and less horny. It also made it harder to work out at the gym. I think it did have a relaxing effect, and my heart rate and blood pressure went down a bit, which would be good for some people, but is not the effect it is usually promoted for. I also think my dreams were a bit more vivid.Anyway, if you already are a high energy person, this is only going to slow you down, make it hard to get out of bed, and actually subdue your sex life. If you're looking to relax, then maybe it would be of use.
