review/text: I am working at a client location. The desk I am on is ergonomically to high for me and the odd angle when typing was causing painful tension in my shoulders. This product provided the needed "boost" to help position my arms at a more ergonomically appropriate angle and thus removed the pain I experienced. I also tend to sit straighter.
