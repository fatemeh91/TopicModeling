review/text: Since I bought these insoles, I have recognized improvement in my body. But I am not sure if it's due to these insoles, because I have started an intense exercise regimen around the same time I bought them. The first day I wore them, I felt soreness in my legs though. So I believe they work. Beyond that, they transform every pair of shoes into amazingly comfortable shoes. They are easy to insert into shoes. My only complaint is that I cannot wear them with heels. I wish they made another version for heels.
