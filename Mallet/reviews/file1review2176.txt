review/text: I wasn't excited about this when I recieved it as a gift a few years back, but once I turned it on I was hooked. Nothing has compared to it. With the different sounds to choose from while watching the water flow over the rock wall, it just relaxing. Try for yourself. If you don't like it, return it. You can't please everyone.
