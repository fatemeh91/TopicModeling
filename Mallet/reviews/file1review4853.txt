review/text: I ordered this product (30 oz size) from DAB Nutrition. They had the lowest total cost after shipping. I first tried Miracle Greens from a place called Grocery Outlet. They had a 10 ounce size for $19.95 without tax. I really like the ease of getting your fruits and vegetables in a small scoup. The taste is pretty good (for something thats supposed to be good for you...usually yuk yuk )and it mixes well with juice. I mix it with a JUICY JUICE 6.75 0z juice box.At less than 70 cents a serving, where else do you blow your money? This is well worth the cost. Unless you put a less than a 70 cents price tag on your health and well being?? I'm glad I found this on AMAZON at this great price. Search around on other sites and you'll waste your time with price (after shipping).So if you don't want to throw down 1/2 a dozen fruits and veggies (and deal with the spoilage keeping it in the kitchen),this is the product for you. It will give you a boost and balance in your health.PEACE & LOVE ~ Koji
