review/text: Can't usually stand protein bars. Too thick, hard to chew, and soy flavored. Crave these bars! They aren't like homemade, but they are as good as prepackaged brownies that are all junk. Big chunks of almond (not slivers) and moist and chocolaty. Enjoy and get those needed protein grams for vegetarians out there.
