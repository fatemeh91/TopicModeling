review/text: I've had dishwashers for years and years and at my age, nearing 60, the last thing I want to do is stand there examining the forks to see if there is crud on them! And with EVERY SINGLE OTHER DISHWASHER DETERGENT, that is exactly what I have to do. I tried the economy, the Earth-friendly, the packets and the sparkly finish crap, but nothing works like Csscade, nothing will EVER work like Cascade, and I frankly don't care if it is harsh because it WORKS. Also, if you ever spill your bong water onto a white carpet,let it be known that a little Cascade rubbed into the black will take it out when nothing else will, even bleach. It's more expensive because of one thing - IT FRICKIN WORKS! Every time.
