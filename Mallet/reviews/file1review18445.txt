review/text: I purchased this over what started out as a bet...how many can drinks can you have and still be legal. Well when it arrived we were on our way out to a dinner party, I pulled it out of my purse and gave it a try.(I'm in my 30's and felt I knew what I could handle) I registered well over the legal limit after 4 cocktails. We were with an off duty police officer at the time and he said that was about right. I now know what my limits are and when out I do let others use it with the stipulation that it is not 100% accurate, just a giudeline. Amazing how many now call a cab. Thank You!!!
