review/text: I'm so glad that I have this. I've had problems with my right knee most of my life, and problems with my right ankle. Then, I started having issues with my right hip. I had months of physical therapy for the hip and it wasn't getting better. My knee was bothering me again, but when I tried to strengthen it, the kneecap would move out of position and swell.I ordered this and within 3 days, my hip problems resolved and my knee got considerably stronger. Now, after wearing it for a few hours here and there whenever I am physically active, my right ankle has been getting stronger and bothering me less, too!I like the loops at the top of the brace. They really do help me pull it on.It's very easy to take the hinges out and wash the cloth part of the brace.My only complaint is that I wish that the portion of cloth below the knee were a little longer because it does somewhat restrict circulation and put pressure on a vein on the back of my leg.I've been very pleased with this product.As far as sizing, my knee is about 16&#34; around and I have purchased the Large, and feel like it fits me well.
