review/text: The Oxo bottle brush is a "must-have" item! I've just ordered four more - can't do without it. As a previous review noted - the perfect tool for preparing things for the dishwasher. And terrific at scrubbing out the insides of flower vases, too! And, like all Oxo products - incredibly comfortable to hold and use!
