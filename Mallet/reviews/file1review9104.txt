review/text: I take a little less than a scoopful before a cardio workout and it gives me a big energy boost. Since I take the recommended amount stated on the package, the large container lasts me quite a while. Some people complain about the taste but just mix it with a beverage. I frankly don't care about the taste, only about the result. I highly recommend this stuff.
