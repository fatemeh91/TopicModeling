review/text: We've had this tub for a little over a month, bought it when my daughter was about 9.5 months. She had finally gotten too big for the infant tub & couldn't really move around comfortably. I had the yellow ducky tub for my twin boys when they were younger, I loved that one as well, but it was a little harder to store because of the duck head. This tub was easy to inflate, easy to drain, and has a suction cup that you can use to hang on the tub wall to dry. No complaints here! It has plenty of room for here to play, she doesn't slide around in it too easily, and if she loses her balance while she's splashing & being silly, this tub provides a "cushion" around her so she doesn't hit her head on the big tub. Excellent purchase (although I do think it's a little over priced.)
