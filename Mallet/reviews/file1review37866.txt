review/text: I loved these from the start. In addition to Belladonna, it has Chamomile to soothe and calcium phosphate which, according to Humphrey's, helps promote strong teeth (I dunno I'm just saying..) I also use the Boiron teething water which is another great review. Regarding Humphrey's (wasn't that a movie?) however, these teething pellets worked tremendously and my daughter has never had a sleepless night due to teething.Some have concerns about the belladonna. There is such a miniscule amount that the odds of causing harm are very low. Still check with your pediatrician before use. Regarding the FDA recall: First off, that recall was for a different brand. Second, I think that company had overdosed the item and Lastly, call me a judgmental jerk, but I have a sneaky suspicion that some people were giving them out like candy. Even though it is homeopathic it is still MEDICATION. So don't overdo it. The max dose on this is 12 pellets in 24 hours. If your child is still having issues you may need to supplement with Tylenol or better yet call the doctor.Dissolving these whole is like watching paint dry but can be accomplished in around 5 minutes. I'm impatient so I crush the pellets between two spoons before dissolving. These pellets are tiny so use the cap to get the dose. I also administered this with the Nuby medication bottle. I never rubbed it on her gums nor gave the pellets to chew and it still worked for her. I hope you have the same results. My guess is that you could probably add it to the night time feed but getting it in the breast could prove tricky! My daughter was an early teether at 4 months and I only needed to use this at night since she didn't have many problems during the day. When she did she would just gnaw on something cold and/or hard (frozen carrots for example) or, as she got older, I gave her an electric toothbrush which she loves.Good luck to all those with chomper problems!!
