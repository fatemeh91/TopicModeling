review/text: Jarrow is fabulous and I am loyal to their brand in a dedicated way, but this magnesium did not help as much as other, albeit cheaper forms of magnesium for my issues (gulp, relieving constipation). I am sure this is a great product for maintaining natural magnesium levels, but it just wasn't for me.
