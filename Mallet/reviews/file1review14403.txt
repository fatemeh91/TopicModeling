review/text: The product packaging and labels were very clear and directions were easy to follow. That is the end of any positive statements. This experience out (Beautiful day, calmest seas I have ever been on and feeling totally rested and well before leaving shore) turned into what I can only call a nightmare. Some how this product made me feel worse than I ever have. I realized it about half way through the trip that every time I put it on I would get sick in 10 to 15 minutes after application. I stopped the applications and managed to hold my stomach even though I still felt terrible. Honest to goodness, I would have been better off without it and feeling bad instead of horrible and non functional.
