review/text: If you're looking for a powerful hand-vac that does not suffer from battery fatigue this is it! I purchased this vacuum b/c I was looking for a handheld that didn't need replaced every 1-2 years as the batter slowly deteriorated. As an electrical engineer I can also appreciate that I have one less power adapter plugged in drawing current 24/7.There are two attachments with this vac: A brush and ~2' tube.The brush DOES NOT have the standard nylon bristles. Instead it has rubber "nubs" that are about 1/8" in diameter and 1/2" long. According to the description this was designed for pet hair so I guess that will work better (I don't have pets). The suction / low pressure created by the powerful motor spins a rotor wheel that is connected via belt to the brush (think of a water mill). It's VERY, VERY, VERY easy to take apart and reassemble for cleaning.The tube is nothing special - just a ~2' ribbed tube make of rubber / plastic.This vacuum is plugged into an outlet and does NOT have a rechargeable battery. Therefore it is quite powerful! Turning this unit on will twist your hand a little (there is ZERO danger of injury). You can feel the motor has SIGNIFICANTLY more power than that of a rechargeable hand-held.It's common to have a filter near the motor / air intake of a vacuum. This until has an additional washable filter on the exhaust vent AFTER the motor. It's a nice addition that most vacs don't incorporate, and speaks to the quality / attention to detail.Bottom Line:If you're looking for a POWERFUL hand-vac that won't suffer recharge fatigue, you've found what you're looking for. The motor feels strong enough for an upright vacuum!
