review/text: There might have been many reasons why my milk supply didn't seem to be enough for my baby and i tried everything. This product seemed to work at first but that only lasted about a week. After this i tried Yogi herbal tea and worked much better for me. Also for a limited time though... In the end I had to complement with formula. :(
