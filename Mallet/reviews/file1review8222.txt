review/text: I bought this brush for various types of bottles. It is decently long, but the bristles aren't as stiff and long lasting as I would like. I suppose they are made the way they are so it can fit into the narrower necked bottles, but for wider moth bottles it is not as good. For the price I don't feel disappointed, but I am not sure I would purchase it for myself again. For your needs it may be perfect.
