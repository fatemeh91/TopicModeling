review/text: I don't like to spend a lot of time in the shower. I'm in my 40s and have better things to do with my time. I have tried other ways to keep the hair off my legs over the years -- epilator, electric razors, waxing, sugaring, chemical products to disolve the hair -- and always come back to shaving because it is generally cheaper, less messy, and doesn't give me ingrown hairs. But, it does require daily maintenance.I love the Schick Intuition. I get to skip the shaving cream step (and don't have to store shaving cream in the shower). I get my legs and underarms shaved in very little time and with little mess.I have not had any problems with nicking my skin. I'm not sure why -- that has been a huge problem with other razors.The cartridges last approximately 7 days for me, shaving underarms and full legs (with a 34" inseam). I generally buy several months of refills at a time so that I never run out.I like traveling with the Intuition. I just pack the razor and a fresh cartridge for the trip -- no can of shaving cream. I toss the razor cartridge when it is time to come home. Of course, most of my trips are one week long. It is more of a pain for overnight trips, as it takes the razor cartridge a while to dry while hanging, If you pack it immediately after a shower it is still damp and gets icky in a toiletry kit.Overall, the convenience of this razor far outweighs the cost for me. I have been using this razor for about a year and a half and don't have plans to change any time soon.
