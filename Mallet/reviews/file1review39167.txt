review/text: It works. I haven't used it enough to say whether it's durable, though the thing is so heavy it feels like it's made of solid metal. Given how infrequently I need clippers, I wish I'd gotten a cheaper model, even if it's partly plastic. This one is just so heavy that it's unwieldy for a woman to hold or maneuver.
