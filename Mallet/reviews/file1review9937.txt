review/text: These tweezers work great, I have been searching for 15 yrs. for product that satisfied me. I have tried probably a dozen pairs and none seemed to last very long or allow me to get ahold of my fine facial hairs that grow wild where I least expect them to be. The older I get the harder it is to see and grab them and the more I seem to be getting them. It has a comfortable grip to it, which is also important do to my authritis in my hands /I am so glad I bought 3 pair, for home, for travel, and I gave one to my mother as a suprise (she likes hers too) yes I would buy this item again.Tweezerman Stainless Steel Ingrown Hair Splintertweeze
