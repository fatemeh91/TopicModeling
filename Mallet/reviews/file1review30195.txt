review/text: This vac is certainly the most powerful hand vac I have ever owned. One throw of the switch and this baby wants to bolt right out of your hand! The filter tends to clog pretty quickly so expect frequent cleanings. Just ordered two more here on Amazon and with shipping and handling, that will set you back $16.The rug beater attachment is an interesting addition and does work, though the angle you hold the vac to make this work is odd. I think a rod attachment to transform this into an actual stick vac would help. That sure beats bending over or on your hands and knees.The hose attachment is great for getting behind things. The blower in the back is great for filling air beds we found. We can inflate a queen size air bed in less than 5 minutes.Beware - if you run out of cord trying to reach a spot, unplug it. Don't pull on the cord. The wife pulled the cord a little too hard and that caused an intermittent power problem. I had to open it up, cut the cord, and solder new connections. B&D; would probably not want you to do this, but I was not about to throw this away.
