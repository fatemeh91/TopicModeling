review/text: This lip balm is the best ever. It smells good, goes on smoothly & lasts a long time.I have had a problem with the tube breaking once but I will still continue using it. Recently had to substitute with another brand which does not have the vanilla & it doesn't smell nearly as good. Can't wait until it is back in stock at my local place.
