review/text: This product used to be excellent, except for short blade life. In my experience, the blade would go bad before the first battery had to be replaced. However it would trim small hairs from the nose and ears very well.Panasonic has changed the blade design from an 'L' shaped blade, which would trim hair entering from the top as well as the sides, to an 'I' shaped blade, which only cuts hair entering from the sides. This has changed the trimmer into a lousy product. It now does a poor job of trimming hair from the nose, or ears, or anywhere else.Panasonic probably made the change so that the blade will last longer. Of course it will, because now it doesn't trim anything. There is absolutely nothing on the package to let you know you are buying the redesigned product. Stay away from this product and buy from another manufacturer.
