review/text: Nivea knew how to make us guys happy.....here the fragrence is almost absent, although there is a scent that is very mild and pleasing. Also, if you let it set for about 3-5 minutes, it really smoothes out your skin and lubricates your face. Very protective moisturizers......excellent choice.Edge and Gillette are gone from my cabinet.......messy, and the scent is irritataing. Ah! Owch.....The NIVEA Shave Gel &quot;MILD&quot; version (blue can, not like this one...which is white) with a fragrence is good.......irritated my skin, but still a good shave......
