review/text: Not only is this one of the best priced E's I have ever used, it is a great mix of Tycopherols so I am assured that I am agetting all the benefits possible, instead of just a narrow band of them. I use extra E as a way to resist using hormone therapy. I can always tell if I'm not using a quality product. This one definitely is the best I have ever used.
