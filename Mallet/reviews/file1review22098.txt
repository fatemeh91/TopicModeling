review/text: Several observations:1. Shape - After you wash these, make sure you shape them so they can air dry in an acceptable shape.2. Bulky - They're still fairly bulky but work fine for around the house under my Bravado Original Nursing bra. Shaping it helps it look less bulky.3. Leaks - Occasionally I leak a lot, and these need changing after one "let down." If I don't change it, it's sure to leak through after 4 hours or so if I let down again. Also, they shift around too much sometimes. That being said, I wear them out if I'm just out as a mom; I stick with disposables when I do anything professional.
