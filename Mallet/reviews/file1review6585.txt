review/text: Very good product. Great at getting under the shoulder blades, which is where my back typically hurts. Also good for the base of the skull and transition to my neck. I wish I knew that it came in sizes when I ordered. This one works but the larger model would be easier to get around my shoulders since I'm a big guy.
