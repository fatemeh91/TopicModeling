review/text: I love Balance Bars and yogurt honey peanut is one of my favorite flavors. These are great. They make a perfect snack because they give your body exactly what it needs, 40% carbs, 30% protein and 30% fat. I eat one three hours before I run and it gives me the energy that I need. Balance Bars are not only good for you, but they taste great too!
