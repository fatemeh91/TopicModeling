review/text: To address concerns regarding expired product, I am including a detailed item list here with expiration dates.Ordered on May 1, 2011. Received on May 10, 2011.Compound Benzoin Tincture Swabstick - 12-2012Antihistamine - 7-2012Ibuprofen - 10-2012Aspirin - 8-2013Antibiotic - 3-2013AfterBite - 5-2013There are other items such as band aids which do not have expiration dates. I am not listing them here but they were included.These expiration dates seem reasonable, so I am giving this product 5 stars (even though I haven't actually used any of the product and I hope I won't ever have to).
