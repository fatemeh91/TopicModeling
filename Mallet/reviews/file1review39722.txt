review/text: It's very light shave gel that didn't clog up my razor and had a fresh-smelling lather that was easy to spread on my skin. For the men out there who shave their heads like me, this is one of the best -- it made the stubble very soft and easy to shave. My head was easy to rinse off and left no sticky residue like most heavy shave creams or gels. This bald guy gives this product a perfect rating!
