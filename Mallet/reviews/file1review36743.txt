review/text: I think the directions are a little off on this product as it suggests 5g/day for an adult, but this can produce some mild cramping. 2.5g is more than enough for an average bodybuilder and it has been suggested by professionals that 1g/100 lb bodyweight is what the body can absorb and utilize.
