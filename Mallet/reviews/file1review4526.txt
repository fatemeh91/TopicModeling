review/text: I was excited to try this razor as I hoped it was another improvement in the Gillette system. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. I have a heavy beard. While the shaves are about as close, they're not very comfortable. I'm also getting about half the shaves from each expensive cartridge. The old reliable Mach III I believe is better. Also, if you want a better shave, try the new Schick Quattro. I think it's great. Sorry Gillette, that fifth blade is a loser.
