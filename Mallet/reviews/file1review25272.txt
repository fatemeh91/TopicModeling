review/text: When I purchased Sennheiser IS410 Wireless Ultra-lightweight Assistive Listening Stereo Headphone System - the prompt from Amazon for 'customers who bought this&#8230; bought this' - so I thought it was the battery for the Headphones.It's not.Worse yet I opened it and then figured out it was the wrong battery.I'm not happy.
