review/text: A good friend of mine said he didn't like this product because it was clumpy (when mixed with a liquid) and had the tast and texture of sand. I buy alot of NOW products so thought I'd try it anyway. He was right. I used it twice and threw it out. I followed instructions and mixed 1 tablespoon with liquid (water), stirred and drank. Floating clumps of &#34;sand&#34; is what it resembled. No thanks. He's found another product that he absolutely loves, and I'll listen to him this time and try that instead. Don't waste your money.
