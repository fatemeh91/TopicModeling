review/text: In our little family, I seem to have somehow gained control of doing the laundry. So, every Saturday there's about a half-dozen loads to be done. I've settled in using either Tide or Kirkland Signature detergent coupled with a little OxiClean added to the load, especially with the white and light stuff. The combination seems to work fine and my wife seldom complains. She suggested that I use Spray 'n Wash on any visible stain, so I've been doing that too. And, believe me, the baby's things can have some ugly visible stains!In any case, this stuff seems to work very well. I'm impressed! Just this week one of my dress shirt sleeves had a very large red stain where I had managed to tip over a glass of red wine. It removed the stain without a trace. I usually identify the stain, then give it a good soaking spray and let it set aside for a while. Later on, perhaps an hour later, I'll add the stained item to a load. I'm only seldom disappointed.Added note of 7/17/11. This is a different version of the Spray and Wash product that I originally reviewed. I'm willing to give it a try as I liked the version we have and we still have a lot of it in that my wife purchased one of those large gallon refill bottles.Gary Peterson
