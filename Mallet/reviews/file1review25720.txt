review/text: When I first got the unit it worked fine. I noticed after the about three uses it's motor was slowing down. I replaced the battery but it did not help. I used it 8 times in a year and it's motor is all ready dead. I would not purchase another Panasonic unit being afraid it would all so die a quick death. Spend more money on a unit that will last longer.
