review/text: I took this as a dietary supplement after reading suggestions that it would help me lower my cholesterol. I should mention that I made drastic dietary changes (pretty much cut out red meats - avoided foods with high amounts of cholesterol) as well and began a regular workout routine. I found this was a useful supplement for me as I took my cholesterol from 260 in November of 2008 to 157 in August of 2009. The biggest drop for me occurred between April 2009 when I had 230 for total cholesterol to August. Of course - no guarantees for your performance on this supplement, but I found it to be a useful part of my strategy to get a bit healthier.
