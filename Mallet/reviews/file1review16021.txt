review/text: I have used these cups before, and they are very good. My only objections to them are that the plastic edge is thin and can cause some discomfort when a lot of pressure is used, and the valve can be tricky if not handled with care. The hand pump is pretty solid, and I do like using it with an extension hose so I can lay the pump off to the side.
