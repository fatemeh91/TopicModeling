review/text: I owned the Remington MB-300 for a long time and loved it. When I needed to replace it, the MB-300 was nowhere to be found. Remington's site is confusing in that it advertises products you don't see at retailers and conversely it doesn't give information about products it makes that do exist at retailers.I found this model as a replacement, and except for being black, it is identical in appearance to the MB-300. The only difference I can tell between the two is that this one will not work unless the battery is charged (that is you cannot run it off of AC power). The problem with this is that the battery charge doesn't last long, and I frequently forget to plug it in, and it takes a long time to charge--so if you needed to trim before heading out the door and forgot to leave this plugged in, you're out of luck.I wrote Remington an e-mail with a suggestion that they bring back the MB-300 model back in October 2011, but they never responded. If I were buying one again, I would make sure the model works when plugged in.
