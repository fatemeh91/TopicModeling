review/text: As I write this review, Amazon has this item priced at $25.98. The return shipping is prohibitive, so I just want to warn everyone before you make the purchase. Please read.In the past Amazon has consistently offered very competitive, if not the lowest, price on every item they sell, so I bought this item a week ago without doing much comparison shopping.Then I found out that Bed Bath & Beyond sells a package of two 70 counts lint roller at $3.99. It's one of their everyday low price item. It's not a weekly special price or a promotional price. You can buy as many as you want.That works out to be 840 sheet (12 rolls * 70 sheets/roll) for $23.94, or 35 sheets per dollar paid. Amazon tries to sell you 672 sheets (12 * 56) for $25.98, or 26 sheets per dollar paid.By the way, I just checked Warmart's website. They also offer pack of two scotch lint rollers. Price varies by store, but you would think Wamart won't be undersold by Bed Bath & Beyond...The bottom line is, Amazon is A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE than big box retailers on this item. Bed Bath & Beyond also routinely mails out $5 off $15 coupons. But even without coupon it's a no-brainer to buy somewhere other than Amazon.
