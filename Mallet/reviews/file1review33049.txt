review/text: I have used this product for several years and found if you take it as soon as you can (a few Sneezes) I use it. I found that it turns off the cold symptons very quickly and in a week you would not know I had any cold symptoms at all. This was recommended by a nurse practioner. Amazon had the best price and all stores do not carry the 240 capsule bottle.
