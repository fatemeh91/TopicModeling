review/text: The Colloidal Oatmeal in the Aveeno Products is the reason I keep buying them, even if I'm not overly excited about smoothing petrolatum over my skin.I wish these products were all natural. I have noticed the oatmeal has a calming effect on my skin and the addition of Lavender, Chamomile and Ylang-Ylang is emotionally healing.The minute you put this cream on your skin, you can feel the difference. Your skin becomes calm, soothed and smooth and silky. Perfect for after a shower or during the day when you need a calming moment.~The Rebecca Review
