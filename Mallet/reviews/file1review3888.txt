review/text: I was very excited to try this product. After just 1 day I had terrible pain but as the directions say to do, I stuck with it. For about 2 weeks afterwards I still had a tremendous amount of pain. And the product didn't work. I called the manufacturer to get my money back and found out that they no longer make this product and that it was actually expired. Thanks Amazon.
