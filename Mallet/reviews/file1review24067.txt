review/text: The pills that these probiotics come in are huge. They are about the same size as my fish oil pills. The smell is akin to rabbit food and leaves a nasty after-taste in my throat. Although this is based in "whole food" as it does state, I'd rather go with a smaller pill that doesn't smell or give an after taste (I am sticking with Pearls).
