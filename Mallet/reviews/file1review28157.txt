review/text: Optimum Nutrition's Gold Standard line is one of the best-tasting and easily-dissolved protein powders I've tried. It comes in a variety of flavors so there should be something for everyone - but I encourage sampling as not every flavor is right for every person. The nutrition label says it all for this powder; High protein, low-carb and very little fat makes this a perfect supplementary protein source.Whether you're an amateur lifter, pro body builder, or just an average Joe it is likely that your eating habits are heavily carb-centric. To a lifter or dieter, the addition of supplementary protein to your overall caloric load will help keep you satisfied as well as foster any lean-muscle adaptations (whether you're after endurance, "toning", or size gains) you may be after. Personally, I use this product as a staple in my diet to offset the cost (in both price and preparation time) of my food budget and it is integral to my weight loss and muscle building goals & progress to date.If you're tired of clumpy tasteless powders, give ON's whey a shot! You'll be glad you did.Some other consumption ideas:(note: boiling or very hot water will curdle the whey mixture - not tasty!)Hot Protein (cocoa)Instead of hot cocoa mix, I add a scoop of whey and artificial sweetener to 8oz of hot water or coffee (NOT fresh! cool it down)Oats and WheyAdd a scoop to a prepared bowl of oatmeal for a flavor (and protein!) kickOatshakeCombine 1/3 cup oats, 8oz water/milk (or ice cream), 2tbsp peanut butter, and ice. Blend to desired thickness (amount of ice and oats used determines overall texture)Don't forget - if you aren't dieting scientifically, you aren't dieting! Consult your doctor before beginning any new diet or exercise program and read about calories, metabolic rate, and body fat percentage. The body you want is yours with dedication and perseverance!
