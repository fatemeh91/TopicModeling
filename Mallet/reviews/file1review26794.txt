review/text: The details:Good product, seems to work well (adds muscle bulk without sending your fat and cholesterol through the roof).Mixes quickly and easily, even without a blender, with no nasty lumps.Tastes decent - you can drink it without adding other stuff to mask the flavor.Start with a 1 or 2 lb. container if you've never had the flavor before. 5 lbs. takes a long time to drink unless you're pounding it like crazy.I bought this after starting to lift weights regularly last year. I typically drink one shake (one scoop mixed with about 10 oz. of skim milk) every night. I mix it up in a blender bottleSundesa BB28-MC01 BlenderBottle 28-Ounce with BlenderBall, Bluewhich works nicely and saves having to clean a blender daily. They describe it as "instantized" which sounds silly, but it's actually milled much finer than other stuff, and in my blender bottle, 20 seconds of vigorous shaking makes it nice and smooth with no lumps at all.The powder is good. Seems to be nutritionally solid and I've seen results using protein powder that I don't think I would have otherwise. The double-rich chocolate flavor is decent - I wouldn't call it "good" per se, but it's not bad. Ironically, it doesn't taste as good as the cheap stuff they sell at Target and Walmart, but I suspect that's actually a good sign. I haven't looked recently, but I think the cheap stuff has more sugar and less protein to make it more palatable, and that's not what I'm after. I've also got a jar of vanilla cremeOptimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard, Double Rich Chocolate, 5 Poundwhich is ok. Not as good as the chocolate, but it's easier to add things to the vanilla to change it up. Around the holidays, I put in a scoop of vanilla whey powder, 8-10 oz. of skim milk, a half teaspoon of cinammon, a little nutmeg, a little ground clove, and a tablespoon of eggnog - best eggnog-shake ever.
