review/text: I just got this brush today and it is great. They offfered a 30 day money back guarantee on the box so I figured...what could it hurt.My teeth feel like I just got back from the dentist.The brush stutters every 30 seconds to tell you to move to the next quadrant and does an extra long stutter when you are done with 2 minutes.It is just SUPERB.1/24/6: Well, I have had it for a few months and I still LOVE my toothbrush. Just wanted to let you know.
