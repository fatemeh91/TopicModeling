review/text: This is my favorite Querectin. It's combined with bromelain, to make it easily absorbed by your body, and has added vitamin C. I have trouble finding it locally in this size product, so I'm thrilled to find it for a great price at Amazon. I take it for allergy and asthma prevention, and it does help, with no adverse reactions.
