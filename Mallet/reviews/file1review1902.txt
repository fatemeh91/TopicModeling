review/text: This stuff is amazing! My husband got trench foot in Afghanistan a few years back and tried a lot of different products but nothing took it away and it just got worse and worse. It was at the point where if he took his shoe off in the next room I could smell it and the whole bottom of his foot was dead skin, seriously. Well I researched products and thought I'd have him give this a try. This is our third time purchasing it and we always get two bottles at a time when we order and I won't even have him try another product because this works so well. It has a kind of strong smell to it but MUCH nicer than what his feet smell like without using it. I can always tell the days when he doesn't wash his feet with it after he takes off his boots because the smell starts to come back.There's been a couple times I've even used it when I felt I was getting athletes foot and it stopped the onset immediately. If you have a husband with a 'stinky foot' problem this is the stuff to get. If you get athletes foot, this is the stuff to get. If your feet sweat all day and you have problems because of it, this is the stuff to get. You won't be disappointed.
