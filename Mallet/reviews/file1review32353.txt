review/text: My problem is this: This is advertised at $5.40 ($1.69 / oz) If $5.40 is divided by 1.5 oz. I get $3.60 per oz...a difference of $1.91 an oz. NOT $1.69!! And even if it sells with two [2] tubes for a total of 3oz. of gel it still does not come to $1.69 per oz. it is $1.80 an oz!!! This does not work for me!!!I love ORAL BALANCE...I use it every night & I SWISH it around in my mouth to cover my teeth & gums. IT WORKS! But this advertising certainly doesn't work for me!!
