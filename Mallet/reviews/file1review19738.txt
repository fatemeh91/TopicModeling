review/text: I was skeptical given the price of this product (and since I needed 2) but I went ahead and bought them since all the reviews were so great. I have to completely agree! It fits perfectly in the toilet, is easy for my son to put on and take off (he's 2), the size is perfect that he doesn't have to worry about falling in the toilet, and the little splashguard on the front is a life-saver (or should I say floor-saver?) I VERY HIGHLY recommend this product, and given that I was so skeptical, I takes a lot for me to say that!!! Worth the expense!!!
