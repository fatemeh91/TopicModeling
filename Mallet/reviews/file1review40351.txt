review/text: Work wonders for a cold. Not sure about the flu.I had a beginning of a runny nose, so I took two capsules. The directions say to take two capsules every five hours at the onset of symptoms. I only took two. Period. The cold is gone!It boosts your immune system and doesn't give you that clogged up feeling. No side effects, as far as I can tell.
