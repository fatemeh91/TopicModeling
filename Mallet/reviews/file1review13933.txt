review/text: Lip Smackers makes me reminisce about high school. (Like many who reviewed this brand of lip balm)I was a total lip gloss freak! This was definitely one of my top choices. Cotton Candy tastes just like cotton candy, and also moisturizes your lips, and makes them feel soft. You will definitely want to apply this a lot (you almost want to eat it, it tastes so good...but I don't advise that...LoL).
