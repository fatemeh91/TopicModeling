review/text: I bought a blue one of these and have been very pleased with em so far.They fit wonderfully and are very snug. I have washed em frequently and they are just now starting to tear from the seams a bit at the waist in front and at one side:-( but it has been six months. I think they are the closest I have found that compare to the old "Soft N Silent" plastic pants. these sure do help prevent leaks that is for sure:-)
