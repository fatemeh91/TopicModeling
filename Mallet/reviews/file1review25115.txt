review/text: I put two scoops of chocolate, 1 instant breakfast no sugar added, 12 frozen strawberries, 1 frozen bannana, light soy milk and almond milk. This makes 3 16 oz shakes so 93 calories from powder, 40 calories from milk and about 100 calories from fruit so for under 250 calories I have a high protien, low glycemic index smoothie that gets me through a few hours as I am trying to eat 6 smalll meals a day! Try it, this is very good
