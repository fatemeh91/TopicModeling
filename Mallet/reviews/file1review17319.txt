review/text: This trimmer fits the bill for a quick touch-up on the beard and mustache.Positives:- Light weight- Fast charge (after the first charge)- Contour handle is niceNegatives:- Not as accurate for trimming. Length isn't necessarily what you think it is.- Still no use while plugged in. I understand they want you to buy a new one every couple years, but not being able to use it plugged in is a a little ridiculous.All-in-all a good trimmer for the price.
