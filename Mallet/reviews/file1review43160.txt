review/text: I wish I would have listened to the other more recent reviews about the new formula. I was able to tolerate the smell of ylang ylang with the old formula, it didn't smell too bad to me. At least it kept the shower clean. After starting with a clean shower of course. But this new formula not only smells bad (like a wet diaper) but it doesn't keep the shower clean. It's funny because everyday, I spray it on the shower, I'm hoping that it will smell better today. I gave it two starts because it does keep the silver chrome? part of the the shower nice and shiny but the rest looks dull and streaky. So disappointing...I have 7 bottles left. I wish I would have listened to the other reviews.
