review/text: First of all, thank you amazon for fast delivery. This little sweeper does the job , hands down, for the money, you can't go wrong. I wouldn't recommend this for thick type carpet, i have that flat kind of carpet and it does well on it, right out of the box you will need to assemble the handle, took me like 2 mins.The name says it, it's small, sturdy, and does it's job.
