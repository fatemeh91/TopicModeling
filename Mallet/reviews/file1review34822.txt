review/text: Considering that this product was so cheap I should of known that it wasn't going to come out well. The color is extremely faint and lasts less that 3 days. I recommend that you're better off going to a professional and take the $4 plus that you would of spent on this product and treat yourself to a slice of pizza and small coke.
