review/text: I should have taken previous reviews more seriously. I purchased two of these for an elderly parent with incontinence issues. Although the product looks and feels nice, it does not stay in place while in use. It moves every time my mother moves and is a source of discomfort and annoyance to her. Disappointing purchase.
