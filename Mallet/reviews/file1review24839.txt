review/text: i ordered this product last month and it arrived right before Ovulation so i only took it for a few days. i have been taking it again now for about a week and i can tell a major change in my body. i would recommend going to the fertility aid website and doing some research on it because i did not see anywhere that it said not to take when pregnant. when going to the web site it says to stop taking as soon as you find out if you are pregnant. it makes your body produce more horomones which can mess with a developing baby. i just simply stop taking it from Ovulation then start again when AF arrives. great product and i would recommend it to everyone!
