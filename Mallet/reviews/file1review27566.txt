review/text: This is good protein. I was not looking for anything too fancy and this is a great deal as far as whey goes. The product is a little lacking on the flavor side. Make sure you drink it in milk, anything else is going to taste like crap. If are really into flavor, check out BSN Syntha-6. It is not 100% whey but the flavor beats anything else I have tried; you could mix it with water and it would taste like a milkshake.
