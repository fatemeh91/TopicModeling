review/text: I've been using this product for three weeks and I am already seeing an improvement in my hypertrophic scars from open-heart surgery almost a year ago. Since the silicone pads are used on a relatively smooth part of the body, I haven't experienced any of the problems mentioned about the sheets not sticking, and I use each for four days. My scars are very red, very raised, and clothing would really irritate them, but Scar Solution is helping. I'll wait until the 12 weeks is up before I give it five stars, but for now, I'm very pleased.
