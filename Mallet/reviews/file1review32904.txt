review/text: I got a box for just over a buck on sale to try. I don't have problems going but there are days where I barely do and it's hard so I decided to try this on one of those days. I drank before bed just like the box said, let it sit in boiling water for 15 minutes. Not even an hour after drinking the cramps started. I spent the next hour, maybe longer on the toilet. It was not fun and I was exhausted, I just wanted to sleep. Finally after going more than I ever have in my whole life. I was able to go to bed. Thankfully I did not wake up due to cramping. The next day I felt okay, then I was out shopping and lo and behold the cramps started again. I ended up going back home just to be safe. I went, and went and went throughout the afternoon, wondering when I would ever stop. I didn't stop going until in the evening.So, the reason for the two stars is the cramps. They were bad. Maybe not as bad as some I have had before. The instructions are not exactly honest, especially how I drank the tea and not even an hour later was going. So clearly it is different for everyone, I will only drink this again if I am so constipated I haven't gone in days, that probably won't happen, but it's there, just in case. The product clearly works but the cramps just aren't worth it too me. Next time I will probably try brewing for only 5 minutes to see if this lessens the side effects. The fact that it cleans you out, is 5 stars.
