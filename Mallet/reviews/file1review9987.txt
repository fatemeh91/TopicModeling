review/text: This probably isn't as good as the high-end body fat measurement devices, but for the price, it's pretty good. You kind of have to practice with it a few times to get consistent measurements, and the tricep measurement can be tricky if you're doing it yourself (I hold my arm up so the fat/skin is easier to reach), but all in all the total body fat is really close to my trainer's measurements, and he uses one of those expensive calipers. It also holds data for up to 3 people.
