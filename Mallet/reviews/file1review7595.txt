review/text: While the product is exceptional, it was promoted as 120 softgels, implying that there would be 4 bottles of 120. In fact, I received 8 bottles of 60. The supplier wanted to get rid of his stock as the expiration date was a few months away. So that is how they were advertised. So much for truth in advertising. Still love these over the tablets, however.ICaps Lutein & Zeaxanthin Formula, Coated Tablets, 120 coated tablets
