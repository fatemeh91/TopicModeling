review/text: This oil has a rancid, off-putting odor that smells NOTHING like coconut, more like yeast. It also has a TERRIBLE taste. DO NOT BUY!!!I consume a jar of coconut oil a week because I take it as a supplement and cook with it. Jarrow, Spectrum, Nutiva, Vitacost and Swanson are MUCH better. Their coconut oils smell really good with a fresh, coconut scent and taste great too.I was surprised because I use other NOW products and am happy with them. The quality, judging by my experience & others', is that this may just be a faulty jar but the quality isn't consistent. I don't see bad reviews from the other oils I use & I have never had a bad batch from the others I have mentioned.
