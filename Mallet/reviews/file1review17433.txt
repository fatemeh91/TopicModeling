review/text: Bought this product six months ago after a good experience with an older Remington model. The trimmer works well, but it stopped holding a charge after two months. The brand new product was good for about 3-4 shaves, then it dropped to two. Now it will only hold enough for one shave, and when it dies, it dies lighting-quick: full speed to completely dead within 20 seconds. Now I have to charge before every use. Not ideal.
