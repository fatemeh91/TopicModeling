review/text: I have used this pen for several months now, and I have to say that it is almost perfect. It writes well, feels like a quality writing instrument, looks good, and getting refills is a snap. The refills last quite longer than I expected, so that is a plus. Also, there are four colors of ink to choose from (black, blue, red, & green), plus there is a PDA stylus that can replace one ink cartridge.The only gripe I have is that I wish it was a little thicker. This is a complaint I have with many Cross products since I have big hands, but the matte finish helps with grip over the polished chrome finish. Even with that gripe, I am ordering my second one since I lost my first one, and the quality vs. price can't be beat!
