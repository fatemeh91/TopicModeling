review/text: As I have written elsewhere within this subject I have tried just about every major brand of soap, cream or stick. For me shaving is very important and I've found most products are so rich that a very little lathers up nicely and the entire product really lasts a long time. For me the most important factors are razor glide and closeness of shave. Also important is how it leaves your skin feeling afterwards("baby-bottoms"). Scent is nice but transitory. Because the products are so rich cost is not really that significant.Now to get to Truefitt & Hill - as of now it has made it into the "final 3" after I have eliminated about 12 - 15 others. The other 2 finalists are The Art Of Shaving (the most expensive) and Kiss My Face (by far the cheapest!) Amazingly KMF is leading now in head to head competition hence the 4 stars for T&H.; The Art of Shaving is so expensive that it might have to be eliminated even though it showed well in the few outings I indulged in it. It might be as good as the KMF. I shave each half of my face with one product then switch halves the next day. I probably have enough products to last me the rest of my life. Bottom line - this is a fine product and is better than MOST other products.UPDATE!I neglected to mention Taylor of Old Bond Street. A last minute appeal was filed and it actually went head to head with T&H; for 4 consecutive days and I have to admit it won by not a slight margin. Accordingly T&H; has been demoted to the 2nd rank and TOOBS has earned its way into the finals with Art of Shaving and Kiss My face. Stay tuned...
