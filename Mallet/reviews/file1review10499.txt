review/text: I bought this set for clinics during my second year in med school since it was about 1/3 the price of the standard Welch-Allyn set. Being a student on a budget, I figured I trade a bit of quality for some savings and planned on buying a more expensive diagnostic set once I start residency. Perhaps my set was defective, but the light kept flickering due to poor contact of the attachment to the power source. The otoscope and the ophthalmoscope heads have their own light source and the handle uses 2 C batteries. Initially, I thought the batteries I just bought were defective and changed them out, but the problem still persisted. Switching between the otoscope and ophthalmoscope heads was a hassle as well. There's a tiny pin that you had to screw in to hold the heads in place. I've dropped that pin multiple times. Not only that, it was more difficult to use than the Welch-Allyn. I would not recommend it for someone just starting out. Also, the speculum is not disposable, which makes it difficult when seeing multiple patients. The Riester set did have more attachments than the standard WA set, but that's about the only advantage. I ended up returning this and purchased WA, which I'm satisfied with.
