review/text: This brush is perfect for Nalgene bottles. It was not easy to find just the right brush, but now that I have, I am very happy. Another reviewer said that this brush was too big to fit in to a Nalgene bottle. That is not true. My Nalgene bottle has a 1 1/8" opening, which is the smallest opening I've seen for a Nalgene bottle, and this brush goes in and out of it with very little effort. The bristles are soft, which I like. It cleans much faster than my old brush because it's easier to control.I have not reviewed many items, but I had to take the time to review this brush because every Nalgene bottle owner should have this bottle brush.When I received my brush in the mail, some of the bristles on the end were flattened out from being in the box. After sitting on the counter overnight, the bristles had straightened back to their original form. So if yours has "bed head" when you get it, don't freak. It'll probably go back to normal with a little time.
