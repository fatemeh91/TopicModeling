review/text: I mix this with 6 oz of milk, and take it two servings at a time (total of 12 oz of milk). I wouldn't go as far as to say it tastes like, say, a Nestle chocolate milk or anything, but it's solid. I still have to take big gulps, but I don't have to chase it with anything after drinking, which is nice. It tastes solid, and I'd venture to say it's probably as good as chocolate protein gets. This is my second type of protein, the first being the strawberry flavor from Vitamin World. I say it's on par with that.
