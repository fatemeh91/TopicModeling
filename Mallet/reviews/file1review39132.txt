review/text: Overall, this is a great product. I previously had a Conair clipper which wasn't bad either, but this is better. This is a heavy-duty product that is built well, runs well, and cuts awesome. No pulling and very even cutting. Very easy to use, especially for a novice.The only drawbacks I found are the weight of the unit (a little heavy, much more so that the Conair), and the attachments seem a bit on the cheaper side to me. Other brands seem to have attachments that are a little more solid.One thing I love is the attachment that protects the blade when not in use and allows you to wrap the cord around it, making storage very easy.But the advantages far outweigh any drawbacks, and as said previously, this unit will pay for itself in one to two haircuts..
