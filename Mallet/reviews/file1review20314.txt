review/text: It's amazing what people will spend there money on today. Just to throw it away! I've used these same diapers on my children (all 3 of them!) and then I've used the SAME ONES on my GRANDCHILDREN! Have mercy, can you just imagine? I bought this very brand of diapers (4 dozen to be exact) 25 years ago and I'm still using the very same diapers. Yes, they are great for spit rags, burp rags, wipe up rags, dust rags, and just about anything else you can think of. And, I only bought once! That was the best part. Can't beat them.
