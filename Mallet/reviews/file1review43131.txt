review/text: After buying tons and tons of detergents, softeners, creams, lotions, potions and medicines for my son (who has chronic, daily, severe eczema) and am at the point where I don't even bother to read ingredients anymore! I have always steered clear of know allergens like perfume, mineral oils and everything else in between and have always bought the things that are supposed to be allergy free or "hypo-allergenic". NOTHING WORKED! Till this! On a whim, I bought a Method Baby Basket at Babies-R-Us and this was included. Complete thought process exhaustion made me use this just to see what would happen. I was amazed! This has been the ONLY detergent that has not caused a rash or worsening of his current eczema. His skin is smooth and baby soft. The scent is lovely - very mild and fresh. It rinses super clean (I always test a detergent by running the cap under the filling water. If it stays soapy for 6/7 cap fulls it will irritate.) This rinses completely clean by 2 rinses! I really think that is the key to keeping the skin happy. I will buy this from now on whatever the cost! And, it leaves everything soft enough to not need a softener, whether a dryer sheet or liquid. Even organic softeners can leave an irritant on the skin. Just try it once. I am really glad I did.
