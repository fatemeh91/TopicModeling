review/text: This is a redesigned unit featuring some enhancements found on the Braun Synchron Shaver: LCD display, mobile charger/charger station, smart charging ability and differet brushing modes. These enhancement are cool to have but adds no significant value to day-to-day usage sans the portability factor of the mobile charge. The redesigned unit is bigger and heavier than previous models, definitely not a plus. The basic cleaning principal is the same as ones in the 7000 and 8000 series, so the result is not any better or worse. If you already have a 7000 or 8000 with Excel 3D, I don't see much of a reason to upgrade.I do have a big complain about how Braun package their products. In addition to a cardboard carton, the box is sealed inside of a plastic blister pack. The plastic is very very thick and hard with very little trim. It took me almost 30 minutes to open it with knife, box cutter, scissors, and some other tools. I managed to sustain cuts on my hands while struggling to open this. I think it's very environmentally unfriendly and consumer unfriendly to use such packaging.
