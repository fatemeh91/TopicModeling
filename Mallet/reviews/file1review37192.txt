review/text: These gloves are wonderful. After reading other reviews I decided to order a small instead of a medium and I'm glad I did because the gloves fit great. They feel wonderful on my hands. One small exception, I like to take the gloves off if I am going to be doing something in the kitchen or anything that will make me want to wash my hands and they are a little hard to get off after wearing them for a while. My hands tend to sweat a little and the gloves stick to my hands. Other than that they are comfortable and they provide relief to my swollen achy hands.
