review/text: I get dry, red patches with scales on my face and outer ear canal along with oozing. This is the first treatment that was OTC that actually worked. It removed the scales, stopped the itching and got rid of the redness.Just make sure you use a moisturizer also to counteract the drying effects of the benzoy peroxide. It cleared me up in about four days. Just make sure you use it three to four times a day.
