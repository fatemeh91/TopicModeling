review/text: I would have rated this toothbrush higher were it not for several deficiencies in design. In general it is a nice looking device, very stylish, if you're into that. It is also very easy to clean, not like the competition Philips Sonicare device, which is terrible to keep clean. The Oral B's brush heads are cheaper too. It seems to brush adequately, but not better than Sonicare in my estimation. The Oral B's control buttons are far too easy to hit while brushing, changing its mode, even turning it off. As far as the modes are concerned, I find that only one, the default one, is really necessary. Finally, the brush head is not provided with a cover or shield as is Sonicare`s.
