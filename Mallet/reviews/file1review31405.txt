review/text: My husband had cataract surgery recently and was so impressed with the adhesive quality of this tape he decided he wanted some. Not sure what we will do with 12 rolls but some reviewers did have some novel ways to use it. It is amazing. He was able to use the same piece of tape for 5 days.
