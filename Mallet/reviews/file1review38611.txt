review/text: I have used NAC for about two years on the advice of my pulmonary specialist. I have, until now, been using the gelatin capsule type. It always had a slight foul odor for which NAC is known (in liquid form). These sustained release tablets are so easy to take and have none of the taste associated with the gelatin capsule. It also works very well to thin secretions and keep the bronchi clearer.
