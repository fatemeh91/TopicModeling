review/text: I did lots of research before buying this seat. At first I wondered why it was about twice the cost of the others out there. After reading LOTS of reviews I decided to take others word for it and paid the money. This works AWESOME, it fits on the toilet perfect with no shifting and I have never had a leak. It comes on and off really easy, my two year old daughter can do it herself now. We purchased the first one in white and then found it in PINK!!! So we sent the white one to Grandma's and now my daughter feels comfortable there too, so a great thing for Grandma to have as well. I would highly recommend this product so you don't waste money buying a cheep one then have to purchase a better one.
