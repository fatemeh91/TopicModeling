review/text: This is the first time I've tried Rescue Remedy. I tried it after I saw it featured on the Dr.Oz show. It does seem to help some. I wouldn't say that it made me completely stress free, but then maybe I am more high strung than I realize. It doesn't taste bad, and just burns a little when you put it under your tongue. I would buy it again.
