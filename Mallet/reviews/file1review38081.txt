review/text: Okay I love the fact that I can now buy great natural products, but c'mon what is with all these natural product becoming so...I don't know? Um... useless. I buy exclusively natural and chemical free cosmetics and I'm finding it harder and harder to find products that are reasonably priced they actually work. This is a RINSE not a wash. It doesn't lather hardly at all, which doesn't bother me as long as it's getting me clean. I don't work in a garage or anything I'm not covered in motor oil or anything like that, I'm just washing off the days dirt. This gel doesn't wash anything off and frankly the smell is...weird. Not sure why someone would think this smelled like honey or mango. It smells like sour bananas. The first time I used it I had to wash off the gel with something else...lol I love Alba and I suggest their products regularly but this one is not great.
