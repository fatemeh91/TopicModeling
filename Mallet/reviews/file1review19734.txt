review/text: I LOVE this potty seat. It's everything this mom-germ-freak wanted! It's super easy to clean, easy to take with to public restrooms and BEST of all, there is no little "boy guard" to fall into the toilet!!!!!! I have had almost every little potty device with my older 3 kids, but nothing stood up and was easy to clean - sure one potty seat was nice and cushy but with it not being one piece like this seat, urine would get in between the plastic - YUCK!It can fit my tall 4 year old boy and my tiny, pint sized 2 year old perfect!! I wish I would have had this starting with my first child!
