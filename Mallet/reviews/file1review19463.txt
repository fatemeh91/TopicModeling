review/text: After trying a couple of other seats, I broke down and bought this one. My son does very well with this seat. He can put the seat on and put himself onto the toilet. The most important part...the splash gaurd it adequate. I love the fact there is very little to clean up afterward. Before this seat I had to clean up every time. Urine seeped onto our seat and it was nasty. I never purchased a Baby Bjorn product. I always thought they were a little pricey, and I tend to be more practical. I am glad I got this seat. Could not be happier.
