review/text: I was diagnosed recently (after deciding to add running to my routine) with Plantar Fasciitis. I finally went to the doctors after I could barely walk and was hobbling along for a month. I was told to ice it and keep off it. I was told it could take 6mo to a YEAR to resolve. I can't just sit around doing nothing so I researched and found this product which I LOVE. I am not running YET but in the short time I have been using this (nightly while sleeping) I have definately noticed an amazing improvement. I highly recommend this product.
