review/text: Although this is one of the cheapest aftershaves out there, it is the best. If you put this same product into a high-end, 100 dollar bottle, it would still sell. It's got a perfect balance between the leathery musk scent and barbershop astringent (alcohol) scents. If there is a classic "masculine scent" then this is it, and there isn't a woman out doesn't enjoy this smell. But more importantly, it feels damn good after a shave. Teens shouldn't look down on this product because it has been around forever and their fathers used it. And snobs need to ignore the price. This is a classic scent that should never fall out of style.
