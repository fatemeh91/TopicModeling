review/text: Hello world...I have to say the Body Back Buddy looks funky, and trust me, really does work.My wife and I love and use it everyday. While you could simulate it's effects with all manner of this or that,having fifteen varying sized and shaped points in one gadget is crazy awesome! You can get to some very hard to reach areas very easily due to it's "cane" design. Possibly the best 28$ I've spent in a long, long time.Buy and USE it, your back and body deserve this level of attention.
