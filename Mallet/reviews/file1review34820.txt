review/text: I bought this item beacuse I was interested in the art of henna, and had tried making it in the past myself, and just ended up with a big mess. This was easy enough to use with the applicators it gives you, but they create very sloppy lines and are only really good for doing simple designs with hardly any details.I had read the reviews on amazon, and they said that they bought a bottle with a stainless steel applicator tip and that worked really well. I tried that as well, and it worked great for doing detailed work, but was extremly tedious because the paste is hard to get into the container, and you have to squeeze the bottle extremly hard to get the paste to come out. In the end, my design looked great, but i had pinched a nerve in my thumb from squeezing the bottle for so long. I couldn't feel half of my thumb for over a week.Also, the henna paste is very light, and doesn't stay on for as long as you would think. And, if you know a thing or two about henna, you know that it darkens in the 24-48 hours after you peel off the paste, but don't expect much. the paste will not darken any more.Overall, the paste did what it was supposed to do, but if you are looking for something a little nicer, I would try making your own- maybe you won't make as much of a mess as I did :)
