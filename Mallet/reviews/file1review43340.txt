review/text: I use this differently than others do. I just got a new HUGE stainless steel sink...I wipe it out each night. I have used thisproduct before on smaller stainless steel sinks in the same fashion...I don't worry about polishing it, as its not a high lustresink, so what I do is I spray the whole sink all around the sides and a bit on the bottom too...I let it sit for a few seconds andit cleans the sink of residue that I didn't even know was there...it breaks the water tension and all the water starts to bead upand run down the sides, taking with it any staining like from coffee, etc. When its as beaded up and has run into the drain as much as its going to, I then use a microfiber cloth to wipe WITH the grain of the steel, wiping all four sides and the bottom. Its not polished at this point, and I'm not losing sleep over that, its cleaner, smells nice and its dry, I don't want a bunch of water marks and lets face it, stainless does watermark. I love the product...I bought a case of it to get the best price, so that should tell you something. Make SURE TO SHAKE IT WELL before each use! Oh...and its MADE IN THE USA, in San Francisco, CA. Support the USA and small business' and jobs!
