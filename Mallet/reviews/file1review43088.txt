review/text: I ordered this item as I went into my 29th week. I am very petite so the extra baby weight really was causing a lot of back pain. It was only a matter of minutes after I put this on that i felt plenty of relief. It is not the most fashionable thing on earth but it does the job. I am able to wear it under my uniform without problems. I highly recommend it!
