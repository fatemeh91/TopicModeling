review/text: I've bought these before on Amazon through a different 3rd party seller and all 100 were perfect - normal sized, thin, and slightly lubricated. This box of them that I just bought through the "ChubbyDickEmporium" however, are way too short, too constricting, and not lubricated. I cannot use them. Now I have to search for a new condom.
