review/text: I was hoping to clean the inside of my stainless steel thermos coffee pot with this brush. The good thing is that it fit through the small opening and the handle is long enough to reach the bottom of the 12 cup thermos, but the brush's bristles are so weak that virtually none of the brown coating from the coffee came off the sides and bottom of the thermos. I tried both dishsoap and a scratch free cleaning powder along with hot water, but this brush was useless. I'll have to keep searching for one with more sturdy bristles.
