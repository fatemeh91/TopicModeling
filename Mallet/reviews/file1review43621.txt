review/text: The Omron HEM-711AC Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor with IntelliSense was recommended to me by my internist for its easy readability. Until recently, I had never had high blood pressure so taking my pressure on a regular basis was not something I was used to. This machine has made it so easy to do and the results are immediate and easy to read and understand. The monitor has an one-touch operation and provides your systolic, diastolic and pulse readings. The arm cuff fits closely around the arm and is easy to apply. I definitely recommend this product if one needs to monitor his/her blood pressure.
