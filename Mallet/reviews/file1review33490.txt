review/text: [2009 update] I got an OralBreeze from Amazon to replace my third WaterPik:QuickBreeze - Dental Oral IrrigatorThe adapter attachment & little hose mean having some extra stuff there at the faucet, but there's no more motor noise, no reservoir to fill, no fumbling with the WaterPik on the counter, etc. I also prefer the higher pressure & steady flow as opposed to the WaterPik's "rat-tat-tat" pulsating pressure flow, but I also think if I'd kept using WaterPik, by now I would've had to order another replacement; these new models just don't seem to last very long.Original review:The old WaterPik I had lasted for years, and when I finally broke I replaced it with this new model. I've found that the water flow often stops and I have to fiddle around with the cutoff & flow adjusters on the handle to get it working again.I'm not normally an "old things are good, new things are bad" kind of complainer, but in this case, the old simple design didn't have much to it and was hard to break ---but I believe the new handle design is poorly done, and if the one I bought doesn't fail completely pretty soon, I expect it'll just malfunction one time too many and I'll pitch it in the trash. I've haven't looked at many alternatives yet, but I like the looks of OralBreeze (not near as noisy and not doesn't look like very much there to break), and will probably avoid buying another WaterPik....Message to WaterPik: There are a lot of pretty good QC engineers out there; you might want to consider hiring some before you throw another design like this into full production.By the way, ask any dentist and they'll tell you that these things are no subsitute for flossing. It's just a good extra thing to do, and can be a great help if you have to deal with braces or hard-to-reach spots where food tends to get stuck.
