review/text: Okay, I'm giving this product two stars instead of one because it was the best eye mask ever unntil it started falling apart. The lining eventually peels apart from the foam. I still wear mine even with the flopping lining, but I am in need of a new mask now. Bummer because the product is EXCELLENT until the lining starts peeling. :(
