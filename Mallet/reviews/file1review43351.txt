review/text: I tryed many dish wash brushes but the Quickie tops them all.It has the correct length, the correct angle, and most importantly the bristles are the right length and flex that does the job properly for all your dishwashing chores. Most other brushes have bristles way to stiff or soft. And the little scraper is just the correct lenth and in the right place.Once you try a Quickie, you'll throw out all your other dish washing brushes.
