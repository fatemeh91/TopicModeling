review/text: I have a permanent cough, and find these lozenges just right to lubricate my throat, especially at night when I often wake up with a dry mouth. I keep a cache close to my bed so I can just reach in and pop one in my mouth. I have never had problems choking on them, even when they take a long time to disolve and I go back to sleep.I have tried other products, but there are the best.
