review/text: Introduced to me by my dentist, Glide floss is simply the best floss I've ever used. No fibers say behind in the mouth or get stuck between the teeth. The flat ribbon shape of the floss and it's smoth surface allows the floss to painlessly get between teeth and gums to pull out food particles.
