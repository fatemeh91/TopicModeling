review/text: I first must point out that this review does have the verified purchase label. I bought it, but I didn't use it. Since it was purchased through a third party, it took longer than the usual 2 days to arrive. Add to that, USPS lost the first one and they had to ship another. The vendor was great. During the time that I was waiting, I was thinking about some of the reviews I had read about it - about isolating where it went to keep it off the good skin, about how strong it was, etc. I remembered the go-to I usually use for any skin ailment:Bag Balm Ointment, 10 oz.. I knew I wouldn't have to worry about keeping it off the good skin. What did I have to lose but some time? I rubbed a small amount in and within a few days, noticed it wasn't as raised and was softer. It's now several weeks later and I think I'm the only one who could still tell where it was. I think it took longer to completely go away because I was pretty hit and miss about using it. It also might have worked faster if I had covered it with a band-aid. My skin hates the adhesive, so I just took my chances. I'm glad I tried something that I didn't have to worry about being harmful. You might want to give it a try. If it doesn't work, you can go back to the wart stick.
