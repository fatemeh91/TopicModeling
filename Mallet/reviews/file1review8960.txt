review/text: I started using Green Vibrance a few months ago to aid digestion. I started a diet of "greens, beans and proteins" and wanted to reduce the side effects of eating beans. I've also had problems digesting dairy products and wondered if probiotics could help... It did! I started utilizing one TBSP of Green Vibrance each day and all of my digestion issues were eliminated. Now, I use it 1-2 times per week and get the same result. This suppliment tastes like fresh clipped grass, so I've found that it works best added to either orange or tomato juice.
