review/text: Having used the O'Cedar hardwood mop for my kitchen floor for several years and needing new refill bonnets, I was dismayed they were no longer available at my local stores. I found them at Amazon and hope this resource doesn't dry up. They have become more expensive, but I paid the price since I like my mop so well.
