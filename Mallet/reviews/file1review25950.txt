review/text: I wish I would have listened to the other reviews. I have had the exact same experience as all the other negative reviews. Charged the batteries, put them in my Kodak Zx1 and they lasted just a few seconds. Tried another pair, out of the four and same thing, lasted a few seconds. Popped in some regular old alkaline batteries, and lo and behold, they worked.It really surprises me that Amazon continues to sell this product. This is JUNK, JUNK, JUNK, just like all the reviews say. Don't waste your money and time. I took a chance to save a buck, and got burned. Don't do the same. Too bad I have to even give this product one star.
