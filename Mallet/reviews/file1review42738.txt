review/text: I have a Remington MS2-290 that I have had for several years that I liked so much I wanted another one at a second location. For the one I received the battery only holds a charge for three shaves, and at that point the charge drops to 0 in an instant, and the trimmer needs assistance to deploy. With my old one I shave over a week before it needs to recharge. It shaves very well but plan on returning it not knowing how reliable the battery will be.
