review/text: Okay, this product works as intended, but is not a long-term solution! Go buy a toothbrush that whitens your teeth: it is far better for your teeth in the long-run than applying chemical treatments to your teeth, and it is much more uniform in the manner it whitens (even when you have applied these strips in the best possible way). I give it three stars not because it isn't a good product for what it is supposed to do, but because it is not the right kind of solution! This is like buying a lawnmower when you can just buy grass that doesn't grow any taller than you want it, too... Anyway, it did whiten my teeth but not as much or as fast as the whitening toothbrush (which whitens just from brushing rather than from chemicals).
