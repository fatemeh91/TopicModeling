review/text: I've had Remington shavers for many years. This was a replacement for one that lasted 10 years, before it became difficult to find replacement foil/cutter. This new shaver gives a great shave, as good as my last shaver, but the battery will not hold a charge for more than one shave, which means that I must plug it in every night in order to shave the next day. If I forget - no shave that day. I didn't think this would be that bad, so I didn't return the shaver (which is a pain), but this defect has proven to be a major annoyance. I am very disappointed in this product, not what I have come to expect from Remington. Buyer beware.
