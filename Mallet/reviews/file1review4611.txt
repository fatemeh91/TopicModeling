review/text: Four words, over priced, over hyped. When compared with my old razor, the differences between shaving experiences were minimal at best.For one week, I shaved one side of my face and head with the Fusion, and the other side with my regular razor, the Schick Xtreme 3. I am black, with tough beard hair, a shaved head, and a fumanchu moustache. I shave in the shower and wash my face before shaving.If you shave your face and head, I recommend you skip this razor. For shaving the back of the head, the balance of the razor is awkward at best. For shaving the rest of the head, it was no better then any other good blade.For shaving the face, the balance was good, but that was about it. There was no difference in irritation between the two blades. The lubricating strip faded to white after about four shaves, meaning you are no longer getting what Gillette calls an "optimal shaving experience."I tried to trim the chin area between my fumanchu moustache. It did a horrible job, no matter how careful I was and the area was left feeling extremely irritated.Consider the Mach 3 over this razor. If you must try this razor, keep the packaging and the receipt.
