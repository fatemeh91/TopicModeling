review/text: I ordered 1 size up but still couldn't slip this contraption over my chest. There is no way to open it all the way to put it on - you need to put it on like a shirt, which is completely ridiculous. It needs to work like a vest, especially with the extra curves and lumps of pregnancy. Notice that the woman in their photo is not particularly well-endowed. Unless you look like her, don't even try to put this one. I was afraid I was going to get trapped in it.
