review/text: Had one since I was a kid. Started many campfires with it. Then it became good for lighting bonfires at the beach. Now, I light cigarettes for the ladies.Got a little one in your life. Makes a great gift. Kids love getting anything that is real, as opposed to the toy version. Like a real set of tools. Or a real Maglite. Try a real Red Ryder BB Gun. It makes them feel all grown up. They can brag about it & show it off to all their friends. Your little 8 year old will have hours of fun with this.
