review/text: I had bought this for a meal replacement shake - it's not effective for that. It does have a nice flavor, although it's very "thin" (compared to other protein shakes - that are thicker)I have been using it before or after workouts (strength training) and it works well for that. I would recommend it be used for pre or post workouts. It's a big jar, good deal for the money if you're looking for something to help you pre/post workout.I'm still giving it four stars because the flavor is good, and can still be used - however not for my original intended purpose.
