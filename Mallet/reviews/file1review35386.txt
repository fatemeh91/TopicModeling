review/text: I may not have researched this enough but don't recall seeing anything about the item moving around too much while driving. Maybe we didn't install it correctly. I'm just reporting that grandma couldn't stand it and it's now a handle I use to stabilize myself while climbing into the attic once a year after the Christmas stuff.
