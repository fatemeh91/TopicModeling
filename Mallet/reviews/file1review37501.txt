review/text: I have a very small mouth/jaw and large fingers. So I bought the Oral-B Hummingbird about five years ago. I use these picks twice a day to remove plaque. It is especially easy to do this bit of dental hygiene, especially as it is done from the cheek side of the jaw. If done twice a day along with a good brushing, some flossing, and a good mouthwash, I find that my twice-a-year cleanings go extremely well. My gums are in great shape. It was especially helpful this past winter when our frigid weather gave me a very dry mouth condition with the high potential of building up of extra plaque. This product along with extra water hydration (to replace the saliva depletion) and the above usual steps kept my plaque build-up to a minimum. Also, I am a type 2 diabetic. . .it is very important to control plaque build up at all costs with this condition. This is one of my most valuable dental hygiene products. Great price for a very hard product to find.
