review/text: I've used this toothbrush for a month now and am pleased. The toothbrush head could be a bit beefier and stiffer, but I've adjusted and brush a bit more gently so I don't warp the bristles too much. My teeth feel cleaner. When I go to the dentist in a couple of months I will know for sure if it makes a difference.
