review/text: This nutrition bar is really good. I eat low-carb foods five out of seven days a week and this really helped when the urge to have something sweet hit last week. The taste of the berries really came through and the yogurt coating is a nice addition to the flavor. The texture was like a granola bar and it wasn't dry in my mouth like some other low-carb bars I have tried. I was sad to see the last of the bars devoured by my family and will definitely buy this bar and recommend it to friends and family.
