review/text: I must admit that I was a little skeptical to purchase this product because I didn't know if it would help my breathing during running. I have exercised induced asthma and currently use an inhaler but still struggle with my breathing especially during humid days. The device requires you to breath from your diaphragm vs. chest breathing which is the correct form when running. I never knew that I was not breathing correctly. I also believe for this device to really be effective, one must use at least twice a day as the instructions indicate. I also use right before I go out for a run too. The device doesn't come with many instructions on how to utilize. However, there are several instructions on youtube.com I believe the powerlung has helped me with running.
