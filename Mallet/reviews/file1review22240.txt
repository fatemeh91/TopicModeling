review/text: When I ordered these, I was afraid they would be too deep to eat directly out of. I have brought lunch to work in them several times now, though, and found that hasn't been an issue. They are large enough to pack a good size lunch in without being too big to fit conveniently or so big that I feel like I'm chasing the food around in a giant bowl.
