review/text: I ordered this brush after trying others. I thought I would give it a shot since it was inexpensive. I use this with wine bottles, water bottles, and sports bottles. I love it. It cleans everything fantastic. Bristles are soft enough to get in tight spaces. I will continue to order and use this brush.
