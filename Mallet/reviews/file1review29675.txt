review/text: I bought a 6pk. of Avent washable nursing pads because I have been going through a ton of disposables and it was getting expensive. Well, I put them on while I was still out and ended up with big wet circles on my shirt. When I took them out, they were completely DRY and my bra was soaked. I kid you not, they repel breast milk. Not to mention you could also see them through my shirt. Do not buy these.
