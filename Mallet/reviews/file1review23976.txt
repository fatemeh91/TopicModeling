review/text: The battery is listed on Amazon as being in "retail packaging," but it was not when I received it. That it may have originally been in OEM packaging could be why the price for this one is much lower than the MSRP. I would have thrown away the retail packaging anyway. It does look and perform like the "real thing," which is what matters to me. When I bought my Olympus E-510 camera, I bought several additional "compatible" batteries. One so-called compatible battery would not even charge, so I returned it for a refund. The others worked okay for a year or two but eventually would no longer hold a charge. My Olympus brand battery is still going strong. That's why I paid the premium price for this "real" Olympus battery this time instead of the much cheaper alternatives.
