review/text: These days, it seems like every store-bought thermometer is a junky toy. They're either inaccurate or they break quickly. (I miss the days of glass/mercury thermometers... they were slow and fragile but they always worked.)Anyway, I decided to try this thermometer. It is total overkill for home use, due to the high price, but I was so sick of the cheap junk sold in drugstores that I took the leap. This is a high-quality device, right out of a doctor's office, and it really does take your temperature in a few seconds.I did have a little bit of a learning curve: the manual is not very clear about how to assemble the unit (but it's easy once you figure it out).
