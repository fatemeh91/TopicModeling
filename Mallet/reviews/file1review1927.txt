review/text: I had a bad case of athletes foot which was bad then got to worse once it was starting to spread on my hands! I started to panic and thought how much worse it will be to get it off my hands. I immediately started looking for a remedy, and stumbled upon this product. After 1 day of use, I noticed the fungus infected skin on my hand started to reduce in size, after about 1 week, it was completely gone, after 1 month, no signs whatsoever!This product has helped me get rid of the "fungus-panic" I have had over the several months. When I see signs of a single fungus infection, I just clean the area with this soap. It has a nice aroma to it and cleans very well!
