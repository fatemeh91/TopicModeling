review/text: I thought this set was a little pricey for the actual quality of the towel. Its really thin and hardly absorbent enough, and my baby is still really small. So how will it dry better as the baby gets bigger? Although I do like that this set is organic and I like the mitt. The mitt is actually extremely helpful when bathing my baby. Again though, I don't think the towel is very high quality and worry that it won't hold up with too many more washes.
