review/text: This is a replacement for one that I had and was stolen!!So must be good enough that I like to repurchase the same product. The timer makes it easy to brush long enough and with 3 settings it can do other thing, although not as useful in my opinion. I think it's most great for kids to get into the habit and do brush for full 2 minutes so they get the little smiley face!
