review/text: I tried this on advice from a friend and found it to be wonderful! My son has been tested for ADD and is borderline. Taking this supplement seems to curb the impulses. I was skeptic at first, thinking there could be any number of things that affect my sons behavior. Then I used up the bottle and didn't reorder immediately...... I definately noticed my son acting more silly and wiggly. Needless to say I now order two at a time and make sure I reorder early!
