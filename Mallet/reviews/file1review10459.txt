review/text: All the other fruit flavors and mint flavors are absolutely NOT what you want to taste when you have a sour stomach. The vanilla cream and especially the coco flavors are particularly sooth & creamy but unfortunately are becoming increasingly rare to find. Surly hope aren't discontinuing this item because I have never heard it even advertised and I'm sure it would be flying off the shelf if they did.
