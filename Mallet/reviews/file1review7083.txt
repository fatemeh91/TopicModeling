review/text: The Wahl 4000 electric razor I purchased through Amazon comes with 3 shaving screens. I have been using the one for the closest shave. It has been comfortable to use and closer shaving than the Norelco I was using before. I have been very pleased with the results.My only disappointment has been with the side trimmer (for use with trimming side burns, etc.) It is not easy to use without pulling hair. And it is not as effective in trimming as other razors I have had.If you don't need the side trimmer, this razor is the best I have ever had -- more like a "blade-close shave" than any other razor I have owned.
