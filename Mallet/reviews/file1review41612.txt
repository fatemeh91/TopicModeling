review/text: This tooth brush is fabulous and has saved me a lot of money in dental bills, but I am currently on my 3rd brush in one year! The experience I've had is that the LCD screen retains moisture then the brush will die. The first brush I tried to change the battery, and as the review by R.Ocamp/leonpro points out under "Cons #8," once you open the mechanism that voids the warranty. My 2nd brush did the same, but I didn't open the brush and got a replacement via my destist, which I have had for the last 3 months and so far so good (knock on wood). I've been wiping the brush after every use and I don't keep it in the bathroom for fear of moisture.
