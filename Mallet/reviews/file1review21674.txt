review/text: We were in that in between stage for the bath. My son was way to big for the baby tub. But at nine months to small for the real thing. I did not need a tub that had slots for the shampoo because then my Son spends all of his time trying to play with the shampoo. This works great. Soft, blows up easily, roomy but not too roomy. This is a good product.
