review/text: This is probably my 20th box of Emergen-C. It tastes good and is loaded with Vitamin C and other vitamins. It gets a little rank if it sits too long in a cup and can stain cups, straws, etc so drink it fast and rinse. Not sure if it has saved me from colds, but I take it anyway b/c I don't know what else to do to fight those invisible invaders.
