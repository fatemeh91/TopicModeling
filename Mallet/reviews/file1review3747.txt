review/text: So i have the most difficulty releasing my bowels. From years of bad college eating habits, i literally just stopped pooping. Once i noticed & recognized that that wasnt exactly normal i set out to fix it. Ive tried everythig under the sun, colon cleansers that would be so uncomfortable it feels like its ripping your colon to shreds, ive had a colonic, ive done cleanse diets, & dont get me started on ballerina tea: most painful colon cleanse in my opinion.The first night my mom actually gave me four pills, though i took them really late (2am), it did work exactly two hours later. It wasnt like an explosion per se (excuse the description) but i did go once more. Thinking i needed a higher dosage, i took five the next night this time at 12: DO NOT DO THIS! i kno the directions say you can take up to five but after taking it the next day after taking four, lets just say my butt hasnt left the royal throne since an hour after ingesting them.Bottom line this product def works & i shouldnt have upped the dosage the way i did or at least waited a day to do that. Good news though, i literally felt my stomach shrinking as i was.... Relieving myself as you would say. Nothing else has worked this effectively just two days into it & thats a blessing for me.
