review/text: I ordered this perfect inflatable back support cushion from Amazon which gave IMMEDIATE relief, for about $14. It is called the Back Booster 1001 Inflatable Lumbar Support Cushion. I shall recommend it to my physiatrist.I have spent (too) much time and money trying to find something that would be just right for travel and have now discovered that item! It really does fold up small enough to stick in your jacket pocket and it inflates/deflates easily.I have had to return several other products of this nature which just did not feel comfortable and cost as much as three times the price, thankfully I have now been refunded for all.
