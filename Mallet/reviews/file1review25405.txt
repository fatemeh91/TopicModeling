review/text: I purchased this thing over a year ago from Amazon. You people LIED to me! I'm shopping for a replacement! Seriously though, it has some problems: 1. The switch doesn't make very good contact, so you end up switching it on and off a few times to get it to start. 2. It's underpowered, so it starts up kind of slow, and you wonder if it is up to the task. One AA battery isn't enough. 3. The cutters seem cheap and don't trim very closely. 4. Overall sound and feel is cheesy. This is NOT a precision instrument.
