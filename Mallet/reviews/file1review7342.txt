review/text: I have used it twice and I love it, very relaxing. I pour Johnson's foot soap in it and it's worked well so far. It's great to have the option to turn off the water heating because the water could get really hot. I love the preasure but I still think that the price is a little high. This item is a little heavy to maneuver.
