review/text: I now own tweezer man tweezers,the nail grooming kit, and these ingrown hair tweezers. I will never own another pair of tweezers owned by anybody. I wish I knew about this brand years ago. They make all my old tweezers seem as dull as a butterknife. Anyway, these ingrown hair tweezers are no different. Now when my husband has an ingrown hair on his head I pull only the problem hair and not a patch on his head. I know he appreciates them. Because they are so pointy and sharp, keep them where a child can't reach.
