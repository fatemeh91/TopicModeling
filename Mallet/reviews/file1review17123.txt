review/text: This trimmer worked great until the battery completely died and wouldn't hold a charge. For me it lasted a little less than a year before dying. I guess I shouldn't expect much from such a cheap product. Also, one annoying feature is that if the trimmer dies while you're using it, you can't just plug it in and continue use. You have to wait for it to actually charge.
