review/text: I don't really know what differentiates between a good and a bad changing pad, but this one is perfect in my book. Cleans up easily thanks to the plasticy top layer, fits perfectly in my changing table, and its soft enough to make my son comfortable. He actually prefers laying on this than in his bassinet. Nothing to complain about on this baby.
