review/text: Ive been taking this vitamin for 3 weeks. Im giving my honest opinion for this item now and I will post another review after 6 weeks of taking mineral rich. The first week of me taking mineral rich, it made me sick. I was experiencing nausea so bad for a week and a half straight. I thought I was pregnant but I wasn't!! I took it every morning before work with water and I guess my body was trying to get use to it. Its been 3 weeks and the nausea has went away... now that I take it with orange juice. This item does make me very hungry, Ive noticed that I eat more frequently and my hunger pains are severe!!. When it comes to my hair, yes it is growing. My new growth is coming in and it is very puffy!! It will be the end of December before I relax so I will see how much growth I will have then. Its not inches of growth but I have new growth all over and its a wavy pattern so far. Im excited to see how this goes for me. I will be back with another post at the end of December to give a full review.
