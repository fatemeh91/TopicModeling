review/text: Well, I was wanting a small vibrator, didn't know what to start with. Saw this on amazon, reviews were good, so I got one and really have enjoyed it. I take medicine that has some sexual side effects, so this little tool works well for us. Be careful when turning it off, if you turn it too far the batteries will fall out. Great for the shower, just keep the plastic cap on.
