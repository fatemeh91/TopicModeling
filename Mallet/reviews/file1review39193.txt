review/text: I purchased my Wahl clipper set from Amazon.com to replace an old set of Wahl clippers I had been using for the past 12 years. I gave the old clippers to my neighbor to use on his pets.(they are still working fine). I am very impressed with the quality,cutting ability, and quiet operation of my new clippers. These clippers operate as well if not better than clippers costing much more. With the attachments included in the kit I can cut my own hair with professional results! These clippers will pay for themselves with only two hair cuttings. I highly reccomend this set for home hair care.
