review/text: I purchased this when my family commented on my teeth looking yellow, they are usually pearly white. I was hesitant about trying this at first, but this worked really well for me. My teeth are beautifully white in only a few days, unlike other methods and products. I use for thirty-minutes to an hour for several days. Very pleased, and have received lots of compliments on my teeth. Definitely, will use again. Keep in mind, that with all bleaching kits you may not see the results of the FINAL color for 2-3 weeks. So if you are planning dental work wait a few weeks for final color, you do not want technicolored teeth.
