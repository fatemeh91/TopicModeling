review/text: I followed directions exactly with this product but did not see any significant hair reduction. Since then I've been using it once a day (evenings) for about 2 weeks. It seems like my regrowth is coming in finer now, so maybe over time it will stop completely, as advertised. One thing I like is that this product does not irritate my sensitive skin. I'm willing to keep using it as long as I'm seeing progress.
