review/text: I love throwing this together into my shaker in the morning for my post workout lunch break. I like that it mixes really nicely with just water so I don't have to bring milk to work (I only drink almond milk and i also don't drink a lot of milk in the first place).It tastes great, no artificial sweetener aftertaste, and ingredients that rival even the super-expensive shakes sold in our local specialty pro-shops. Proteins, amino acids, great price, and easy to consume... Definitely will be a regular buy from now on!
