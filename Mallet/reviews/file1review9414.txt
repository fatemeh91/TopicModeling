review/text: I love the idea of these. They're a great size and close tightly so that I can carry my vitamins with me in my purse. But I have to rate them a 3/5 because the first time I touched one of the packs the little piece of plastic used to open the pack broke off. The very first time, and I barely touched it! Probably more sturdy ones out there.
