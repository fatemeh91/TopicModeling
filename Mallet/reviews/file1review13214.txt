review/text: Priva Ultra Plus Waterproof Sheet Protector, WhiteI bought some of these sheet protectors for my 90 year old mother who lives in an assisted living home. They are wonderful and very absorbant. After the first night she said she never had such a good nights sleep....very comfortable and no worries about an "accident."
