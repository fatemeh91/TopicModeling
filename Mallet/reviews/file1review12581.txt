review/text: I am very skeptical about all the hype about our colons and the toxins that are lurking. I decided to try a cleanser and this one claimed to be one of the best. The dose suggested is if I remember correctly, 4 pills at bedtime and if you did not get results, then you were to increase your dose to 6 pills. After the first night I got sick. Lets just say that I could not stop going to the bathroom. If I wanted to do that, then I would just eat a huge plate of mexican food. After this experience I doubt I will try another one.
