review/text: I was taking this vitamin before i even got pregnant to build up my folic acid. This pill was great it is gentle on stomach just as long as you dont take it on a empty stomach while your pregnant. The pill is a bit large - but keep in mind its a once a day vitamin. Id rather take one big one then 3 small ones. This pill did not constipate me or anything. Im ordering my second bottle,i recommend this to everyone.
