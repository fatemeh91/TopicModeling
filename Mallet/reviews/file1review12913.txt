review/text: I ordered one of these a week ago and just ordered a second one for use with an elderly parent. A nurse at the local hospital told me that "chucks," as she called waterproof sheet protectors, cost around $30 each. I wouldn't be surprised if hospitals pay $300 each (or $3000 ;). In any case, Amazon's price is more than fair, and these chucks are good quality and do what they are supposed to do. I'm sorry I ever wasted money on disposable pads (from places like WalMart), which are always too small. Having two of these means that when one gets soiled it goes into the wash and the second one goes right on the bed, and I'll probably never again have to strip the bed and wash sheets (and sometimes a blanket) to deal with an accidental soiling.Follow up on June 15, 2009: I've owned a pair of these chucks for about a week shy of a year now. They've gotten daily use, and sometimes daily washings, and they are as good as new (with the exception of a few discolorations that I have yet to try to remove with Spray and Wash). When I take my elderly parent on a trip to visit relatives who live over 500 miles away, I take the chucks with me and they completely prevent accidents on the relatives' beds and furniture, as well as on the passenger seat of my car during travel. These are so much better in my experience than disposable chucks, primarily because disposable chucks slide around too easily and are typically too small. So after a year I can report that these are quite durable. And, they have never failed to prevent accidents from spreading onto bedsheets or chair or sofa cushions. They have contained every single accident that's occurred on them (and there have been many, almost daily it seems). I swear by them.
