review/text: First the razor: Excellent craftsmanship. All metal construction, looks very handsome, no slip handle, great angle of razor to skin for excellent shave. I was a bit concerned about not getting the Heavy Duty, longer handle, or adjustable; but those concerns are gone and I am very happy with my purchase!No on DE shaving in general: This is my first experience with DE shaving and it has been great! I was, like many people looking into this, a skeptic. First the downsides of DE shaving in general (not this razor) are it's slower because it necessitates much more concentration, but that is also a huge part of the enjoyment for me because it makes it much more of a methodical ritual with an even meditative quality. It's also difficult to shave in the shower, which was my previous method that I do like. Now to the pluses. Very close shave even with one pass and no across or against the grain pass for me yet! Cost effective in the medium-long run with very nice blades (I used the 1 Merkur blade that came with it and some Derby Extras, which were both satisfactory) costing a tiny fraction of even cheap disposable razors, not to mention the outrageous cost of high-end models. This in-turn is much better on the enviroment with no plastic parts and lower amount of trash.
