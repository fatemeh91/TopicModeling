review/text: This is a very great Quality product. I have used Remington brand for past 10 years and never had problems with this Brand of Shaver/Trimmer. Only the newer model is better and keeps getting better each time I try to buy a new one. But--Remington brands are good and can be used for several years and don't burn out even after using them regularly for several years.In all it is a great Product --no complains at all !!!
