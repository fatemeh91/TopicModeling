review/text: I have had two ER411 Nose and Ear Hair Groomers before making this recent purchase. I thought those ER411 groomers were perfect. You could cut on the end as well as the side making them very effective. Panasonic has changed the inner blade design so that it cuts only on the side. The old design was referred to as a curved blade design. Panasonic packaging still refers to the ER411 having the curved blade. In phone calls to Panasonic I have been told that the new design is in effect now.
