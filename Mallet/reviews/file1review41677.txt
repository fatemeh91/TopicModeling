review/text: I absolutely LOVE this toothbrush. (1) I like the way it feels on my teeth; this encourages me to USE it. (2) The 30 second timer is great. Rather than doing quadrants, like a dentist does, I do front back bottom, front back top; it seems so much easier to keep going for thirty seconds instead of two minutes, even though the end result is the same. (3) I don't know if other electric toothbrushes have a travel case but this one does, I took it on a short trip without bothering with the charger and it was super. Thumbs up!My dentist recommended Peroxyl to go with, and I like it a lot too. Perfect combination.Colgate Peroxyl, Antiseptic Oral Cleanser (Hydrogen Peroxide), 8 fl oz
