review/text: People are always looking to cheap out on oil for their hair clippers. Well recently I got a Classic 76 which was $100 so I decided not to mess around with products I don't trust. If I trusted oster that their $100 clipper is better than a $20 clipper, and it is, why would I not trust that their oil is also better if they say it is.People on the internet will tell you to do all kinds of things to cut corners. I actually read people frequently telling others to use vegetable oil. That will absolutely destroy your clipper motor. Run your finger over the hood of your stove. Feel how sticky it is? That's vegetable oil.For clippers, you need a low viscosity oil. And it needs to be ultra refined because clippers have a very high degree of vibration and friction when the blade rubs against itself.Would I trust 3 in 1 or WD40 on a $500 power tool? Yes, because power tools are built to take abuse and have mostly permanently lubed bearings.But when it comes to my $100 clipper, I'm willing to spend $4 to get oil specifically designed for it, because there is a difference, and food grade mineral oil is not the same, it is higher viscosity, which is bad.Hope that helps clear some of the confusion about lubricating oil.
