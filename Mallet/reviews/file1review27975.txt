review/text: I swear by this protein and recommend it to everyone that is starting to work out or looking for protein. I have found that, for a reasonable price, this is one of the leanest protein powders that you can buy. It tastes amazing with milk and just takes a couple of days to get used to it with water.This fits a small niche for people that are looking strictly for protein. This doesn't have a huge amount of calories and won't bulk you up fast because it's NOT a gainer (though some may think all protein shakes are supposed to do that). This is for strict protein intake.Serving sizes are about 30g and with 24g of protein, it fits well. 5lbs will last me about 1.5/2 months with 2 servings a day.
