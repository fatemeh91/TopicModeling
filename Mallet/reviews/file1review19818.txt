review/text: Love the seat. It just didn't fit onto the toilet that we intended it for. It does work well on the others in the house, so we're keeping it. FYI- the one that it does not fit onto is a round slow-closing seat (Bemis brand, I think). Two problems - the back of the seat curves up, so the training seat cannot sit flat. There is also little or no space at the hinge area between the lid and the seat, thus no space for the back end of the training seat to go.
