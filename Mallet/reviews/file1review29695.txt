review/text: These pads are O.K. When I have used them they have moved around some, and that kind of defeats the purpose of the pad, but they are a nice size and thickness and seem to do their job when they are where they need to be. the lace is supposed to help them stay in place, but I think it didn't work to well with my choice of bra.
