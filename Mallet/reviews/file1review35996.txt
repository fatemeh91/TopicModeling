review/text: As a 45 year old male I found my recovery after work out was a bit slow....recovery meaning, how long it takes to heal after body building with free weights. I like the sore feeling in the muscles the next day or so after a good workout... but it stayed sore into the next two days and that got in the way of other workouts during the week. I still feel sore in a good way the next day but it heals up much faster now for strength and muscle mass. Let's face it, 45 is on the oldish side and this stuff does help me. On another note, I had good vision until last year. I found that I needed reading glasses, the kind from your local drug store or grocery store. I couldn't see small print without them. This week I see an improvment in my vision, even now as I type this I can see much better. I looked it up and I found articles on vision improvement with L-Arginine, that is awesome. I was taking it on an empty stomach and had coffee later too on an empty stomach. This was a bad idea and found it all went right through me in a bad way. I take it one hour after eating and just before a workout. It's better on the stomach and a great boost for your workout............................IT TASTE BAAAADDDDD! fill a glass with 4 oz. of water...... put in 2 tsp. of L-Argenine and stir.....the longer you stir the more disolved it will be.....Hold your nose and drink it down......you can stop in the middle to breath but do it through your your mouth and continue to hold your nose....bite into and suck a small lime wedge while holding your nose.....let go of your nose and done with a bit of bitterness.
