review/text: I did not have high hopes. I have bought 3 battery charged hand vacuums and finally got sick of them. They always said they were powerful. I tried this one and was literally blown away. I can use this one and vacuum up the fur (the cats seem to fight in the bathroom - sibling rivalry?) and kitty litter in 30 seconds. I am in kitty litter heaven. I have had the product for over a month and am still pleased with it. Even my husband is not as grumpy about vacuuming out the area when he has to.
