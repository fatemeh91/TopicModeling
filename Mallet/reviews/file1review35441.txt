review/text: The first time it worked the second it worked but i used it as instructed like the last time but the bottle flipped upsidedown and melted onto the metal coils on the bottom of the dishwasher. It was in secure. It did clean and the bottle pealed off ok leaving no plastic but come on seriously. Again it does a good job of cleaning,
