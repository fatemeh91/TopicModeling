review/text: this tub has alot of leg room for your baby... you can easily blow this tub up yourself in about 5mins.. my little guy loves to play in it.. and it fits snuggly in the tub.. and after we use it we hang it on the back of our shower wall with the suction cup it has, it stays blown up and ready for the next bathe.. I would definatly recommend this tub to someone whos baby is out grown the sink and still too small for the big tub.. this is the tub for you...
