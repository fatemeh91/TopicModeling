review/text: The product overall is about 5/5 stars. The only problem I have is when you run out, getting the tiny least bit out could be an issue. It's my second favorite lubricant for maximum pleasure. It does smell a bit like bubbles a bit, but not too noticeable. Great size bottle to keep in your purse, or put somewhere discreetly.
