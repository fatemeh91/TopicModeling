review/text: After years of trying many vitamins from different companies (even Nutrilite) I tried Source of Life Liquid and I love it. It's been almost 6 months now and I feel energertic and balanced. No more dips in energy, no more reactions to exotic ingredients, no more swallowing lots of horse size pills, no more wondering if the pill is dissolving. I'm super picky on taste and I can handle this. It's the best tasting liquid vitamin I've ever swallowed. Even my kids think it's ok. WOW! HERE'S THE WARNINGI buy it at Wildoats and tried to save money buying it here. I LOVE Amazon for books! But the SHIPPING COST made this cost $14.00 more than if I had gone to Wildoats. If it's the only way you can purchase this, it's worth it but if you can get it locally from your health store, save the shipping costs. I have Red Lightning from Source of Life and I love that product too!
