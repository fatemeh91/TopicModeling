review/text: After a less than steller visit to the dentist last time for myself and my husband, I deceided we need to step up our dental care at home. After looking around and talking to the dentist I deceided on this brush. It does a great job at cleaning feels like I just left the dentist. And I like the 30 second interval timer makes brushing go by very quickly. The best part was I found this brush at sams club in a two pack (comes with two handles, one charger, and one carry case) for $99.00. What a steal and I figure if it saves me dental work in the future then it is worth the price. Sams club also sells the replacement head at a very resonable price. Here's to happy brushing and good check-ups
