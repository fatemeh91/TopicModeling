review/text: My personal physician recommended this and I bought at goo.gl/k4MLG ,with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!He told me that digestive enzymes play key roles in our health by enabling our bodies to digest and utilize all the nutrients we ingest to the greatest extent possible. Without enzymes, food, minerals, and vitamins are useless. Moreover, these enzymes also play a key role in the elimination of toxins and the digestion and removal of scar tissue that builds up inside all of us as we age.Here is the major functions of systemic enzyme therapy:1) Fights Inflammation2) Fights Fibrosis3) Immune System Modulation4) Fights Blood Contamination5) Fights VirusesTry it...especially if you have acid reflux. I haven't had reflux since I started taking these babies...a MUST HAVE. Taking these digestive enyzmes with each meal has made such a difference in my quality of life. No more being dragged down by indigestion and bloaty feeling. They got rid of my acid reflux, bloating, gas and indigestion. And even better, I lost three inches off my hips taking these. They help get rid of excess fat. Would recommend taking this product together with probiotics at goo.gl/0qVLp if you have the same problems as me.
