review/text: I am quite active in sports/bicycling and find the massive amounts of chest hair I have to be a nuisance as well as I enjoy a smooth chest and, during cycle season, smooth legs. I have tried laser treatments that were partially successful, but the hair is still thick.I was tired of shaving and thought I would give these epilator things a try. I tried the Emjoi AP-9GAR Gently Gold Caress which was not too comfortable and only partially effective. I thought I would try this one just to see if the "4-way pulsating pain softener stimulates the skin to offset the pulling sensation" actually works.It does. This is a great device for removing hair. It is not pain free, but, it does not hurt nearly as much as the Emjoi.So 5 stars because it makes the most of an otherwise painful situation
