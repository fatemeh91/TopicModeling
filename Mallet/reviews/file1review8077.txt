review/text: So far, so good. The lid is very tightly screwed on. The bristles, so far, are holding their own. I've only owned it a week, but with available replacements, I'm not too worried about them bending/breaking super early on.The button to release the soap is very sensitive. It's very hard to release just the tiniest of soap. I ordered this to not actually clean dishes, but clean out my pedestal sink as the bowl is rounded and oval and very hard to clean with a traditional brush. I'm two washings in and very happy.
