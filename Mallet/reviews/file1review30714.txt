review/text: My son has a heavy beard. Multi blade razors keep cloging up while he's trying to saving.I decided to buy him a quality German safety razor for his birthday. I chose the Merkur Classic by the reviews, giving this product high marks.The delivery was timely. The razor meets the expectation. It's of good quality steel,with a hefty feel. My son is very pleased with the effortless saving experience.Considering what some multi blade razors cost, the purchase price of this quality German safety razor will be recovered in the savings, compairing the purchase price differential of safety razors vs. multi blade razors.Merkur Clasic is a life time quality razor.
