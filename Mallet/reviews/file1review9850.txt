review/text: these tweezers are really nice for getting out ingrown hairs of splinters. however, they are not as sturdy as they appear. if the tip gets bent, they no longer work properly. i have no idea what happened to mine to bend them as they are always in my makeup bag, but they did, and now the ends don't touch enough in order to tweeze hairs. i haven't contacted tweezerman yet about a possible replacement since it's only a lifetime sharpening for free.
