review/text: I love the shape of the Elasto-Gel cervical collar and how it molds so nicely to the neck. It is completely flexible and provides nice relief.I have used this item only as a cooler. I keep it in my freezer (in the baggie that comes with it) and use it when needed. The coolness only lasts for about 20 minutes but it is very soothing for inflammation of the neck (like a slipped disc which is what I have). This is not an ice pack, so it will not freeze the skin. It can also be used for heat--but I do not use it for that purpose and cannot speak about it.As a neck cooler, I love it and am considering getting multiple collars that I can switch out. Very soothing and comforting also for MS (which I also have) during those times when I am overheating a bit. I just ordered the mask as well and have used this on my forehead for headaches. Extremely comfortable and easy to fit.
