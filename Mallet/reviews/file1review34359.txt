review/text: My son had eczema many years ago as a baby. The dermatologist who I took him to recommended this soapless cleanser for his baths. I used it the entire time until he was 4 years old. It was wonderful as it did not dry up nor irritate his skin at all. Now that my son has a baby daughter of his own, unfortunately she has the same issue with eczema. I told him about the Oilatum that I used to use on his skin and he began using it. It is still just as wonderful a product NOW and it was then. I will buy again.
