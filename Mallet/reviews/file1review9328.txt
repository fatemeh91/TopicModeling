review/text: Hi we use these and love it fits easy in most pockets,opens ok (maybe tabs could be a little bigger or something as I have just a little trouble some times openning due to my Body)It can really hold a lot of pills mine holds 14 reg size pills (wish I did not have to use any) but take meds about 4 times a day.When I fill them I use 2 small towels rolled up to keep them upright while open, and when we leave the house they go with us & I can tell what day of the week it is (or should be) there are 6 colors monday & sat. are both blue,If the Makers of these great pill boxes think about it and use some of old people More older people with troubles could use these even better,or have a set for older people.ALSO I use food coloring pens to Mark/color some of my pill that kind of look the same or easy to spot like red is heart med/blue water pill,but i looked alot at pill boxes and these seemed the best for us and even got 2 extra sets 1 for a gift that keeps on giving.try them I think you might really like them.chrissy M
