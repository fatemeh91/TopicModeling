review/text: We bought these booties for my grandma for Christmas because she has problems with her feet. She heats the booties in the microwave and uses them hot. Since she started using them, she says her feet have been feeling better! She creatively puts them on her shoulders as well to help pain in that area. The downside to these booties is that they only stay warm for about 10 minutes before she has to reheat them.
