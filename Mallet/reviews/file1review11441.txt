review/text: The product looked great, but after 3 hours of taking off commode bolts, this apparatus would not fit on our toilet--which was to be used by my elderly father. Since it involves a commode, I assumed that nothing can be sent back, and we were out money. It says it fits all toilets, but not true, and difficult to attach--which was not mentioned.
