review/text: The first time I used this product, it hurt...A LOT. However, I soon learned that shorter/trimmed hair diminishes the pain factor a great deal. I love this product b/c it gets rid of underarm hair, and the regrowth is often finer and easier to get rid of. Just be aware that it will take a few hair growing cycles to notice a real difference. I would definitely recommend this product to my friends.
