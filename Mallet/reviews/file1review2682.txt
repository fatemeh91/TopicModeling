review/text: This is the second Remington shaver I have owned, the first rechargeable. It gives me a great, close shave, which is difficult for other makes I've tried, due to a heavy beard.I would reccomend this model to anyone who needs a good, reliable, inexpensive shaver.It's well worth the price!j.r. flores
