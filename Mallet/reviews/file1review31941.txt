review/text: I am a huge fan of a lot of Garden of LIfe products, namely this product. I began using this in my mid- to late twenties now in my early forties I am still using it. I mix mines with pineapple juice the taste doesn't bother me but I would recommed a straw for those who just find this to sooo bad..... This products keeps my skin clear, my hair long, my nails growing and keeps me regular. Ihave tried other products but I alsway come back to Garden of Life. I recently tried tthe Raw Vanilla Protein with almond milk vanilla and strawberries.... it wasn't too bad... but the jury is still out. I tried the Garden of Life coconut oil, then tried to specturm...I will be returning to Garden of Life......
