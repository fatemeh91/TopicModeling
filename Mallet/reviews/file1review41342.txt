review/text: I have searching for a sunscreen for sensitive skin for years and have tried many brands that broke my face out in a rash or acne. (I have very sensitive skin) This did not break me out or irritate my skin. It works great and is never greasy. A little goes a long way. It goes on white and takes very little effort to rub in.
