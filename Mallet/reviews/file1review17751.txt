review/text: I use it mainly for trimming my beard - I use a separate trimmer for my mustache. I used to use that other trimmer for everything, but it's beard trimming guard finally broke. This new trimmer has a much better designed guard, and I hope it will last longer than my old one (seems better, more durable plastic)
