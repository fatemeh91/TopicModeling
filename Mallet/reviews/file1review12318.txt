review/text: I have been using Azure Cosmeceuticals HydroPeptide corrective face creme for a little over three weeks now and I am so pleased with the results thus far. Right away I noticed how smooth it made my face feel and the smell is very refreshing. Now a few weeks later I have surprisingly noticed how the lines around my eyes are not as deep as they once seemed. Even though I love smiling and laughing I don't like the lines they've produced around the corners of my mouth. Those I am noticing are not as intense as well. I don't think I've ever been as pleased with a product as I am with HydroPeptide and I have spent my fair share of money on top brand name products. My next product I want to purchase from Azure is their Eye treatment, dark circles concentrate. I think any mom can relate to the dark circles under the eyes. I will be refering my friends and family members to Azure Cosmeceuticals.
