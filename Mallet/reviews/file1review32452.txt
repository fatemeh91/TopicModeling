review/text: I bought this knowing that I don't have a jogging stroller but wanted something to put drinks in when we go on day trips to various festivals. Even though it doesn't fit quite like the picture (we have an umbrella stroller) it still works great! This is really worth the buy as far as I'm concerned....jogger or not.
