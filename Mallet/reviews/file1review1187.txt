review/text: These are absolutely the best tooth care items around, aside from brushing. When I used to brush & floss my dentist reports were so-so, but now that I moved to using these Doctor's brush picks after each meal I get perfect reports and no, I don't work for them, I have tried all other kinds of devices including looking in drug stores when in England, etc. and these are the best. Depending on your sensitivity you may at first wonder if you can get the brushes between your teeth but they are the smallest of this kind of device and if you work carefully you will find they get left over food out better than anything. Floss still may be required for celery strings trapped where your teeth are close but floss doesn't get out the between the teeth stuff as well as these brush picks. try them.
