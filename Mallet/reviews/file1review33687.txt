review/text: I have used waterpik for years...the older models lasted a long time. My latest waterpik broke after just two weeks...the pump stopped working. Prior to that, the waterpik I had lasted one year. I don't have time to drive 25 miles to the nearest service center and hassle...I don't intend to buy any more of these. A friend has an interplak, and it has proved reliable.
