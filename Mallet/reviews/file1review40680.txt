review/text: I'm not sure what the bad tasting comments are all about. This bar tastes the best(by a mile) out of all the other high protein bars i've ever had. Too bad Amazon sells these a little more expensively than what i can get them for in the store, otherwise i would've started to buy my regular supply from them.
