review/text: Well these batteries are ok for the price (I think they were around $6+shipping when I bought them). But they do not really hold as well as a 2900 mAh should....I get about the same charge as I do from a 2500mAh on my Canon S5 (around 100-150 shots w/Flash). But if you are looking for some cheap batteries that work, I guess this is the option for you.
