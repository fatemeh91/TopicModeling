review/text: I used to get one of these 5lb tubs per month at the price of about $35 through subscribe and save (reg about $40). Did it for over a year... maybe even 2. loved the product and loved the price. Suddenly got an email a couple months back that ON doesn't want to participate in the Amazon subscribe and save program any more. So I come here to see what the regular price is and was expecting $40-- without the S&S; 15% discount-- but see that the price has been jacked up to $53! I would have been fine paying $40 without the S&S; discount, but this is ridiculous.Seems to me like an underhanded business tactic for ON to use S&S; to get people buying it regularly, then discontinue the program and jack up the price. Sorry ON, but I'm not playing that game. I'd rather switch to a lesser protein powder than do business with you now.---UPDATE>3/22/12---Here are some links to other protein powders that are more reasonably priced, and that are in amazon's S&S; program:[...][...][...][...][...][...][...]
