review/text: Let me first to say I was shopping for a Littmann when I came across this one. After reading the reviews, my mind was made up I would give it a try. Boy, am I glad I did!!! I LOVE this stethoscope! Using it just about everyday for work, I can tell you it has great sound quality and appears built to last! Having the color option was just icing on the cake, but I DO get compliments on it all the time and I've had several co-workers ask me where I got it. I am confident in saying if you need this for general assessments, or for personal use, you will not be disappointed- especially for the price!
