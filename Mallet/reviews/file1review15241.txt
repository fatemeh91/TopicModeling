review/text: I usually get the Balance Carbwell bars (in chocolate peanut butter), and I mistakenly ordered this in peanut butter flavor.Pros- huge flavor- soft / chewy textureCons- high sugar & fat- not covered in anything (it's just peanut butter throughout -- I thought there would be a hint of chocolate at least).Other:It's way too sweet for my liking (compared to the Balance Carbwell bars). I'm not use to all that sugar.. so I doubt I'll be buying this again.
