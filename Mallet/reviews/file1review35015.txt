review/text: Ok, so it doesn't really taste like a snickers, but since discovering these bars I have been enable to eliminate dessert altogether. These things really do taste very good but be careful of the various flavors as some are more 'chalky' than others. This chocolate/peanut butter variety is my favorite. I carry them with me when I travel for in-between meal snacks and when I'm at home they serve as an after dinner dessert.
