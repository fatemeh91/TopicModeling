review/text: I bought a used portable dishwasher for a great price and immediately went on Amazon to find a way to clean it. I can't say that this cleaner made my dishwasher brand new again, but I did feel that it did a great job disinfecting the machine and it certainly made me feel better about running my dishes through it.Based on other reviews, I'll probably use this cleaner from time-to-time to keep it fresh, but I've found I can get it cheaper elsewhere.
