review/text: I use this about 1x / month. It cuts the nose and ear hair.Being an engineer and having one for over 5 years I know thatone of the problems has to do with the contacts becoming dirty/corroded. The solution is to clean the contacts thoroghly.I mean very very thoroughly.And use a new AA battery. I have even had fine use with a rechargable battery. But I have experienced troubles that weretraced back to corroded battery contacts. I think the reasonfor this is that when the metal gets wet it will eventuallycorrode.Also leaking batteries from putting the unit away for a long timewith an low battery will cause damage to any circuitry when abattery leaks a bit of alkaline material.Consider complaining to the battery company for this kind of problem.Overall this unit is exactly worth the price you pay for it.It does cut my hair which is coarse but I'm Arabic. Maybe aBlack person should avoid this. Or maybe a Blonde person should avoid it. I have not tested it on my friends.It does tickle the nose. That kind of drives me nuts. But thereis not much to do but tolerate it. It does give a close shave 'up there' if you move it around and around.Enjoy the cutter. I do.
