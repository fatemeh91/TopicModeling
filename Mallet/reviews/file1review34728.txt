review/text: I bought this deodorant at Whole Foods after reading lots of reviews and trying a few other brands. I normally wear only unscented deodorants because I don't like to smell the product all day long. For odor, this worked really well. It seemed to cover up even strong odors when I reapplied it after sweating for a while.But the fragrance was a deal-breaker. I actually fell in love with the light baby oil-like scent when I smelled it in the store. But when I applied it, the scent became much more medicinal. After a little while, I thought it smelled like calamine lotion. So it's not something I really want to put on every day. I'll be returning it for a refund. If you like the scent though, this is a good deodorant.
