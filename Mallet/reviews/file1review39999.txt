review/text: The nutrition label on this isn't easy to decipher, but it has an added 100 mcg of B12 as cyanocobalamin (listed as just cobalamin) per 3 tablets.I emailed Solgar who confirmed this.This is a synthetic form of B12, which is odd since beef liver is supposed to deliver plenty of its own natural B vitamins.I'd prefer they did not add any synthetic vitamins to this product, as it is the most ubiquitous and easiest to obtain, and Solgar is a more trustworthy name I believe. But there you have it.
