review/text: Does not chew my face up like most electric shavers do, even the high end ones. Does a great job both wet or dry. No electric shaver will get all the hairs, but this one does as good a job as any, and it's easy to get the stragglers with a regular blade or the built in trimmer that's a very nice addition. I did not expect such good results because of the price I paid, but after reading a few reviews I thought I'd give it a try since I didn't want to spend a lot of money. I mainly use it to keep trim, but if I'm going somewhere special, then I use a conventional blade. I think the secret is not to apply too much pressure to your face, hold the skin taught, and to use and cross hatch motion when shaving. This leaves me with little or no irritation. I would recommend it, and I must mention it was delivered very fast. Good product and good service.
