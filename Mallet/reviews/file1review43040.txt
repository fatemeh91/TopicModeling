review/text: I bought two of these in small and medium hoping that one size would fit me and help take the weight of my belly off and help with round ligament pain.This belt is SO UNCOMFORTABLE!! It is a pain to get into. If you're pregnant, you're going to be going to the bathroom a lot and who wants one more thing to wrestle with while doing so? I could only wear if for an hour before I packed it back up and returned it.I'm making due without a belt. I wish there was a good product out there but I haven't found it. This is NOT your solution, ladies.
