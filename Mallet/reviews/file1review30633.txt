review/text: Switched to a double edge ("DE") razor after becoming fed up with the high price and inconsistent quality of cartridge-style razors from Gillete (the Atra, Sensor, etc.). I chose the Merkur based its simple construction and favorable user comments. I have been using this razor for about eight weeks and my first impressions are positive.The razor itself is of very high quality. You will feel the difference the second you pick it up. The Merkur's two-piece design is simple to open and it holds the blade evenly. I've yet to encounter any trouble changing blades, even when half-asleep in the early morning. The blade is perfectly aligned every time. The guard is sized well and is very forgiving if you get impatient.The shave quality is good, but temper your expectations. You're still shaving the same face, merely using a different tool for the job. Your choice of blade and shaving cream or soap will have more to do with the quality of your shave than the razor itself (Derby Extra blades are my favorite). I have not experienced a single ingrown hair since switching to a DE kit.Overall, I am happy with this razor. It does a fine job of holding the blade and is easy to handle. When used with a quality blade and proper shave soap it will give you a shave closer than that of a 2/3/4/5-blade cartridge razor.
