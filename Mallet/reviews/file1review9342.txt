review/text: I appreciate the size of each container. Each side is able to hold 2 large calcium supplement tablets along with other tablets. The overall small size of the container makes it very portable. I just throw a "day of the week" in my brief case and take off in the morning. It if is a weekend day, then I will just slip the "Saturday" or "Sunday" case into my pocket, and take off for the day. The only criticism I have is one voiced by others---the individual cases don't lie flat when I am filling them. It isn't much of a hassle, but the design seems like it isn't yet perfected. The cost is right, and the value for the price is great. I have recommended this product to friends who take large sized supplement tablets.
