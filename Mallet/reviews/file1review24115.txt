review/text: Neutrogena Lip Nutrition Balm Mango Moisture is a great and effective lip balm that delivers moisture to dry, flaky lips, without being overly greasy. This balm has a delightful and subtle mango scent (not overly sweet). The balm is subtly shiny, without being tacky, and is truly a great beauty product for those who are looking for an effective product. I don't wear much makeup, so, usually lip balm is my big purchase! Great to know that this product is still available online. My experience has been that their line of lip balms is great. I have also tried their mint, and honey flavors, as well.
