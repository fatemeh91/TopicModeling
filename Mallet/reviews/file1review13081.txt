review/text: I ordered this product because it could deliver both hot and cold to the five vertebrae in my neck which are damaged. I am disappointed, however, in the lining of the gel pack. the velcro keeps coming in contact with the soft lining and is already showing signs of wear and tear because of the snagging. I would rate the shaping down the center back as excellent. I would recommend this product. Just need to be careful and not allow the velcro to snag the lining.
