review/text: I got this because of my back injury that has been really bad again lately and I sit a lot in my computer chair. The one big problem with this backrest is that the curve of it sticks far from the chair making the space where your legs go is cut to half of what it originally was. My back feels better but now my legs hurt because they hang over the edge too far because of the curve of the backrest.
