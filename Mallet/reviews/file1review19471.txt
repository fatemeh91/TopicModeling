review/text: Having our grandson move closer meant I needed to purchase some necessary equipment - and a potty seat is definitely necessary. However, the toilets in our home have elongated seats and many of the potty seats I looked at were made for standard toilet seats. After reading numerous Amazon reviews, I decided to purchase the BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Toilet Trainer and am very pleased with my choice.The BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Toilet Trainer sits on the seat and is then secured by turning a wheel at the back of the seat. This moves two "wings" so that the seat attaches securely to the toilet seat, even if it is an elongated seat. After securing the seat, I tried to wiggle the BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Toilet Trainer from side-to-side as might happen with a rambunctious toddler. The seat held firmly in place.The splash guard at the front of the seat is sufficiently high to prevent accidental oversprays. Further, it is curved so that liquids do not hit it and splash out the sides; they flow down into the toilet as they should. The solid piece construction of the main seat prevents waste products from becoming trapped in grooves or joints and minimizes the possibility of odor.Further, the seat rinses off easily and can then be hung, by the large attached loop, to dripdry. I hung a light S-shaped hook over the towelbar on the back wall of the bathtub and use it to hold the BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Toilet Trainer after it has been rinsed.If you are looking for a quality potty seat which will fit both standard and elongated toilet seats, you should definitely consider the BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Toilet Trainer. It is a five-star necessity!
