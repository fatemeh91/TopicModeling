review/text: I had higher hopes for this. Maybe I'm just too heavy of a sweater, but I couldn't use this on a daily basis. I found that I started to stink 1/2 way through the day. I think it just doesn't work with my body chemistry. Not that it doesn't. It did help, just not long term. I'd have to carry it with me to make sure I was OK by the end of the day. It does smell pretty though and will probably use it as a body spray in the summer.
