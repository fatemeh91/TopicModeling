review/text: I've owned this for over a year now, but I've only had a beard intermittently during that time. I'd say about 5 months worth of trimming.Well, like another user said, this thing was definitely under-powered from the start. And now, it has completely stopped working. It won't hold a charge at all. Even when it is plugged in, it's not receiving enough power to barely turn the motor. Even if I try to charge it for a full day, the battery won't get charged, the unit simply gets hot to the touch. Clearly some sort of defect with the power supply/battery.
