review/text: The headline is a good three word summery of this product. It will work almost every time from the git go & after three or four times you will have perfected it to the point that it will work every time with all your socks. I highly recommend it for anyone who has had hip replacement or has difficulty crossing their legs at the knee to put on their socks. Great prouuct!
