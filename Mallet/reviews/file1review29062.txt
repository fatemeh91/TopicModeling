review/text: Great features if they worked!I had a Braun before that worked great and thought I would be safe buying another. Not so. ThisWas a wasted 60 bucks. Takes me twice as long to shave after going over each area of my face several times (and my facial hair is not thick). I regret not returning it every time I shave. If you buy Braun make sure it is one of the more expensive models.
