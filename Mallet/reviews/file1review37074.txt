review/text: If you are considering the Hummingbird flosser, don't! I tried it, and it practically pulled a crown out. The floss tips are too tight, and the tiny flosser is a nightmare to hold.On the other hand, the Reach flosser is about the size of an electric toothbrush, and very easy to hold. Moreover, the Hummingbird floss-head refills cost almost twice as much as the Reach refills.
