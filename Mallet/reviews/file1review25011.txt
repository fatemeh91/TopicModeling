review/text: Okay, the title's a little crude, but aren't we all a little oral? For some reason harder and harder to find in the stores, I buy these by the carton and find myself "sharing" with friends. Great for the breath, low in calories, an upper for the taste buds. I think they're as good as the original that come in the tube and are full of sugar, and I'm so happy Amazon carries them!
