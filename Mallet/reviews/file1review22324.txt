review/text: My wife and I recently purchased 3 new GE Profile stainless steel appliances for our kitchen. We liked the modern look of stainless steel, but were apprehensive about consumer complaints about how difficult they were to keep clean. I did some research on various cleaners, and came across the series of Cerama Bryte products. I went to their website and read several customer reviews which offered glowing reports of their products. I went to Amazon to see if they offered the product, and purchased them through an affiliate supplier for a cheaper price than I could have purchased them from Cerama Bryte directly.These wipes perform brilliantly. I just wipe the surface, wait a few seconds, and wipe clean with a microfiber cloth. Fingerprints and food stains come off effortlessly. Our appliances are almost 5 months old now, and they look as new as the day they arrived. One wipe can be used on all 3 appliances (refrigerator, stove, and microwave oven). I usually wipe them down once every 5 days, so a canister will last about a month or more. Such an easy product to use and the results are outstanding. If you are looking for a stainless steel cleaner, this is definitely the one!
