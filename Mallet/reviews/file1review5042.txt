review/text: I was looking for a dishwashing liquid that was not only easy on the environment but easy on me! With as many dishes as I do a day, I didn't want to use a product with toxic ingredients like dyes and fragrances. And to learn that it is made with vegetable-based products rather than petroleum-based products made it all the better. In my opinion, it cleans just as well as any other dishwashing liquid I've used!
