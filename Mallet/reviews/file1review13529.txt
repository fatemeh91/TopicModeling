review/text: I recently moved to Boston and though not blond, had a blond moment when I gave my address for where to send the product. I kinda used a combination of my old and new address. Long story short, my product got lost in the mail and it was totally my fault. The customer service people at SmartSole sent me out a new pair immediately and were super nice about it.All that aside, I love the insole. I am still not a super model, but with my daily morning walk in my Smartsoles. I am making a dent on the baby weight I put on!
