review/text: I purchased these hoping to balance my swinging moods and night sweats. I've taken these for about two weeks and I notice I am sleeping better and seem a little more at ease. I haven't really noticed if I break out sweating at night still yet but , the biggest noticeable result is my finger nails! I am a life long nail biter and within this short time I've grown a pretty strong healthy set of nails. Very nice affect. I've increased my dose to twice daily and I will purchase these again!
