review/text: It took 12 days for the cartridges to arrive. I have been using a Mach3 since they were released. These blades look like Mach3 blades and come in a box for Mach3 replacement blades, but they must be counterfeit. I had to put my old blade back on my razor until I can go buy replacements at the local drugstore. Save your money, a single blade razor is far better than what is being peddled here
