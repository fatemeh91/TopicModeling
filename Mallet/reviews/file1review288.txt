review/text: Before this purchase all I owned was a huge silver bullet. It got too hot from the friction. Found this new toy at Amazon.com for almost half the price anywhere else, including Adam & [...]. The dong's too long and virtually unusable, at least, not for penetration, not stiff enough, like bad sex. I have to keep it up against my skin with one hand to enjoy the pulsating rotation of the beads. The rabbit ears are worth sacrificing penetration, but it doesn't make a very good boyfriend.
