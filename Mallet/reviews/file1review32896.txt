review/text: I tried my first cup of this tea the other morning and it was very pleasant tasting.It seemed as though I could feel it working shortly after drinking it. Almost a rumbley moving through my tummy! "No cramping or pain"By lunch it did its job!I will say the rest of the after noon I had gas that was not just gas and sent me running to the bathroom.This tea worked so well I can't help but recommend it if your having issues with needing to go!
