review/text: These bottles are NOT packed for UPS shipping which is what Amazon uses. 3 out of 4 bottles received (different orders) had multiple gel-caps ruptured inside. This made a mess and affected the neutral flavor of the coating.That being said, these are great for any sort of inflammation, back pain, or muscle pain. If you need something for a sudden head-ache, use Ibuprofen (Advil) liquicaps. Either of these will kick in within 30 minutes, sometimes a little less. Advil peaks sooner and works harder, but wears off in 4-6 hours.Aleve, this product, peaks after a few hours, but wears off in 10-14 hours. This is what many osteopaths will prescribe for sports, lumbar, or similar injuries as "Naproxen Sodium". These OTC capsules are lower dose, at 200mg each, max of 2 at a time, and max of 3 per day, but it's the same drug and works the same way.The box and bottle tell you the recommended dosages, and [...] will tell you all of the physician's info about the drug.Only your physician can prescribe higher dosages or treatment that does not match the label, so be sure to read the labels and only take as directed.
