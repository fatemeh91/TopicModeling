review/text: I have chronic myofascial trigger point issues along with fibromyalgia. Some days my body would scream for my deep tissue massage therapist, but I can't go everyday. Now I don't have to wait in agony! I literally have the tools I need to help work out cramps, trp's, and other issues on my own. I still see a therapist weekly, but now the rest of the week isn't comprised of increasing debilitating pain as often. And the AccuMassage is perfect for relieving neck and arm tightness. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these two tools!!!!
