review/text: We have had a couple really nice bottle brushes that have recently just given up completely and we needed replacements fast. We looked at all the stores we regularly haunt, but did not find anything of a satisfactory type and quality. So online I went and found this great sounding brush and decided to give it a tryout, so far it has performed flawlessly cleaning all sizes and shapes of bottles and containers of all types as well. Overall this has been a great purchase, and I hope they have these in the future for when this one gives up the ghost in a few years...
