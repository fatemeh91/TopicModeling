review/text: i wouldn't be surprised to find out most of the positive reviews are fake. Used it overnight and when i woke up my skin was dry and flaky where i had put it on. Put it on in the morning and by lunch time i need to use something else as it causes my skin to flake. Won't buy it again and would not recommend it.
