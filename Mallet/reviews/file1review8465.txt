review/text: What's to say? I bought this to clean my 27 oz Klean Kanteen. I had wondered if the OXO's handle were too short to get to the bottom of the Klean Kanteen, but it isn't. It works fine. The brush's bristles are stiff enough for good cleaning also. I am definitely glad I ordered this brush off of Amazon.
