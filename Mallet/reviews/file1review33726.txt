review/text: Got hooked on the "more blades are better" routine until I figured out that more blades equals substantially more money for replacement blades. In addition, the space between the blades clogs up quickly.With the Merkur razor that is not a problem. In addition, you get two sides to each blade which means twice the shaving time before you have to change blades.Besides, replacement blades can be bought on the cheap at Dollar General, 5 to 10 for $2 or so. You can't buy one multi blade assembly for that much.By the way, shave is just as close if not closer with this type of razor and they never seem to break (like a recent 5 blader where the blade assembly broke while I was shaving -- lucky I didn't bleed to death).
