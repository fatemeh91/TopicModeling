review/text: Although a bit pricey (whether in store or online with shipping and handling), this is possibly the most convenient way to take peppermint. It does help with my digestions, but not monumentally. I have purchased some peppermint oil that I will add to green tea in the future or just continue to drink peppermint tea. Tea has the benefit of working on symptoms after they occur instead of contantly trying to anticipate them.
