review/text: I received this as a Christmas gift a couple of years ago. My brother in law requested the same trimmer this year for Christmas so I was happy enough with it to give it to him.PROS:- Can sculpt and trim pretty well around the face and cheeks.- Adjustable trimmer height options give you the trim length you wantCONS:- The battery starts to go haywire after a year- Can't plug and trim. In other words if the battery dies you can't plug the thing in and continue to use it (not sure why)- Trimming around the neck is pretty hit or miss. It's cut me a couple of times, but not often.Because of the battery life and lack of ability to plug-in and trim I docked two points. But as I said, it was good enough for me to buy for my brother-in-law so it really isn't that bad.
