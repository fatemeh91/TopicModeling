review/text: In addition to desensitization, I also feel heat - but not of the good, welcoming kind, more of a chemical burn. It's also definitely not something to be used without a condom, as your partner will feel unpleasant effects as well. Another product I've tried does not produce that sensation. Won't buy this again.
