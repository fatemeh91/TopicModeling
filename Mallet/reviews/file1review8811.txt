review/text: I tried this product while hurriedly on my way out of a "mom and pop" healthfood store in Princeton in 1994. A busy executive and single mom with a lot on her "to do" list and mind, I 'humored' the girl at the doors handing out little cups of green liquid that (especially at the time) brought thoughts of "Jim Jones" to mind.Within 30 minutes of hurling down the little green cup of what I considered "slime" I noticed a profound change in my mental status and energy levels...so much so that upon completion of my errands, I drove 40 minutes back to the store to investigate the ingredients of the green slime. I was overwhelmed by the list of greens and probiotics but much more so by the way I responded. I took a deep breath upon looking at the price and purchased my first jar.Sixteen years later, I'm still recommending it to any/every one I know. Throughout the 16 years I have called it my "Fountain of Youth" but no doubt it made up for known enzyme and autoimmune deficiencies and more. I have had it independently (kinesiology) "muscle tested" where the practitioner said, "I don't know what this is but your body clearly needs it more than anything else I tested." The point here is that I was simply validating to have a 3rd party tell me what I already knew. I also suspect that along the way, the company changed the formulation from the original which made it less powerful - I noticed a change but could not forsake it.So...16 years later I no longer NEED GV - I suspect that the probiotics overcame a systemic yeast infection of decades from chronic sinusitis, antibiotics and prendisone.What I do know is that I can HEARTILY RECOMMEND AT LEAST A TRIAL of this wonderful product to anyone with allergies, asthma, immune or GI dysfunction who wants to enjoy vibrant health.
