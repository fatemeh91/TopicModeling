review/text: I purchased the Bed Desk for use with my laptop. The first thing I noticed was that it was to high to use in bed. The second thing was that when you put the top of the desk at an angle, there is a wood stop that keeps the laptop from sliding forward. That lip is to high and it digs into your wrists and also the screws on the hinge were sticking out and gave my 2 year old laptop it's first scratches! It may work out ok as a serving tray or magazine/book rack for use in your bed but thats about it. Even as a lap tray when your sitting in a chair, the all wood underneath is hard on your legs. Not the best designed thing and am returning it.
