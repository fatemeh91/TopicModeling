review/text: I don't know if it's everything else in combination to this item, but my 6 year-old son is definitely a lot better than last year since I started using this. I make a decision last year to not do any prescription drugs and have been looking around. It taste great and there's been no allergies. But I'm also a vegetarian-no eggs, cheese and only almond milk, so I'm sure that contributes also. I'll keep on buying this product for him.
