review/text: I have been shaving for 40+ years, trying all types of products from disposable to electric razors. I have recently started shaving my head and am happy to say the Fusion Power provides the best overall shave I have ever experienced. It is a little more expensive than other disposables but the close, comfortable shave makes up for the price. Too bad Gillette has stopped mainstream marketing.
