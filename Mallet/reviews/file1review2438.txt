review/text: This is the best lube on the market. It's better than every other lube in many ways:No clean upDoes not leave any residue or get "sticky"Tasteless and Odorless, allowing you to concentrate on what's importantVery concentrated - a small amount goes a long wayBest "feeling" out of all the lubesExcellent moisturizer, hair moisturizer (for wet looks), and great for massages alsoFeels the most natural out of all the lubes, excellent for all areasOther things:- Very expensive - but WORTH IT- Will stain if left untreated - if you get it on your clothes, drown the area with water, or it will stain later and it's very hard to get out after that point
