review/text: This Thermometer is fast and really easy to use. I have 8 month old daughter. And with this Thermometer I can take her rectal temperature without any problems. Yes, it can show different temperature if you will use it few times in a row. Just allow some time to cool down. Then it will be more accurate. If it shows lower teperature, then you expect, most probably you didn't put it in correctly. I'm more then satisfied with this product. And the price is more then affordable.
