review/text: I almost bought this item because it appeared to be pure, as it states in the ingredient section. However, upon checking the Vitamin Shoppe website, I found out that it is NOT! It also contains: gelatin and magnesium stearate (along with water, of course). If you are looking for a pure product, this is not it.
