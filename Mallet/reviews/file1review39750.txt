review/text: I finally went in for an eye exam and found out I need glasses (which I have suspected for a year) but was overwhelmed with the various option of prescription lenses. I ordered these to tide me over until I decide what I want/need in $150 lenses. These are cute, light and sure help in reading in low light at night. The case is also very handy and has lasted well. (I had my doubts.) It's a nice surprise when something turns out to be better than you had hoped.
