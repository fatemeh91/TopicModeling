review/text: Love all the features but this shaver doesnt cut as close as I thought it would. I donot get a close shave. maybe the cutters are dull or something but my experience is not a positive one. On the other hand the self clean features and recharge stand are great. It really cleans the shaver well for a no maintenance shaver.
