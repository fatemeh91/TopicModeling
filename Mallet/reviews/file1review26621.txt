review/text: This a great idea. I have a travel pillow made out of the same material. However, the seams on this cushion are not as good. I weigh 185 lbs and half-inflated it and it sprung a seam leak after only three days. The pillow I have for travel still works after 15 yrs. If the manufacturer of the cushion could strengthen the seams as good as my pillow, I would buy another.
