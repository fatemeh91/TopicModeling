review/text: I decided that if I got two haircuts out of this I would be ahead. I am a 50 year-old man and I am happy with a tidy hair cut trimmed short around the back and sides. My wife with no previous experience of haircutting has been able to cut my hair really well and we are well ahead on the deal! The DVD is as useful to give confidence to the beginner as the good advice it does give. I am happy with my purchase and smile at the saving we make ever time she cuts my hair!
