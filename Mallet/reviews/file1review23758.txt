review/text: I have flat feet and work on my feet all day. I have been to two podiatrist. One wanted me to have orthtics made for my feet. To much money!! I went to another one who told me about the Spenco orthotics that would be just fine for my conditon of needing an arch support which also helps in the postioning of my feet so I can afford other complications that can happen with flat feet. I ordered them, got them, and love them. I ordered another pair so I can leave them in the shoes I wear often. Very affordable and well made. Highly recommend Spenco
