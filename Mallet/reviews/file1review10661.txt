review/text: My mom use to use this on me as a kid when calamine lotion didn't do the trick. I am less allergic to poison oak and ivy now, i still am allergic, but it does not spread as bad.I got poison oak last weekend and I turned to this old fave. I use it as a lotion, and also as a wash. It does help it heal super fast, and helps it immediately stop itching. after i wash this off i follow up with aveeno anti-itch cream. Ahhh!!! There is never relief when you have poison oak, but this stuff REALLY works.
