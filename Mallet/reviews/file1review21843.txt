review/text: These chews are nice. Be sure to transfer them to a sealed bag or container when they arrive. The bag they come with doesn't work and they get hard/crunchy if they're left in the open air. You can still eat them, but you have to suck them like a hrad candy until they soften up. I find all the flavors to be quite plesant and it's fun to just reach into the bag and see which flavor you get.
