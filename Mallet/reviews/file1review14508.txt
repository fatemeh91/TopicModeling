review/text: This is seriously the only thing that's worked for my daughter. She has been sick almost every day for 3 months, with no relief. I tried essential oils (many of them!), her doctor tried medicines (worked for a little bit, but wasn't lasting), we tried so many things with her. I happened upon the ad for these while looking for something else so I bought a box. They work! She hates the ginger, so I wish, too, that we could buy just the flavors we want, but she's lost weight and is dehydrated so I'll buy them. We even tried the Preggie Drops because they were cheaper. They are super delish but aren't working at all. So, here I am, buying 3 more boxes of preggie pops. They are rather expensive, but since it's the only thing she can use that enables her to keep food and water down, then I have to have them. I'm glad they are made in the USA, though. That's a big bonus. Hopefully her sickness subsides soon, or I'll have to get a part-time job to be able to afford this! They aren't just a luxury for us...it's necessity.
