review/text: I really like this snug-tub for many several reasons. First, it has a suction cap for saftey and you can attached it to either the wall or the floor of your bath tub. Secondly, with its air filled sides, even if your baby accidently bumbs her head, it will not caused any pain. The sides are also very comfortable and pillow-like and she can rests her head there (looking up) while I wash her hair. That actually makes washing hair much easier and prevents soap from entering into her eyes. Thirldly, unlike a bath seat, you do not have to fill your entire bath tub with water and that really saves a lot! The only thing I add onto it is a non-slip rubber mat to its floor. This is much better then having a bath seat because it is much harder to wash your baby's creases with all the bars in between.
