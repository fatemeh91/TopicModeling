review/text: I got this for my wife to use and she was less than pleased with the product. The conditioner didn't leave her hair feeling any better; in fact; she thought it actually made her hair more dry and frizzy. Thinking it may be a reaction with the shampoo she was using, she even switched shampoo and didn't get the results she was expecting from this conditioner. I don't think this product lives up to its advertising claims, and we won't be purchasing it in our household.
