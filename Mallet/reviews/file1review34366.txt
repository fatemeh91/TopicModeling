review/text: It does work. My acid problems are history after less than a month. I've also started watching my diet but this helped tremendously at the beginning. It tastes horrible, you have to make a nice shake:) I normally use a couple of bananas, one strawberry yogurt, maybe some real strawberries and mango plus skim milk, it's not bad in that combination. I started with one shake instead of supper every day. Now I'm down to a couple a week. I tried shakes first but they alone weren't helping. When I got this I noticed a difference within a few days.It also replaces your daily multivitamins and supplements: it's stuffed with almost all vitamins and all kinds of micro elements. If you have one shake with fruit a day you don't need to take multivitamins any more.
