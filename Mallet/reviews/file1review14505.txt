review/text: I was told by two friends that these would ease my nausea. The 'special blend' of herbs really is a gimmick in my opinion. they don't tell you what's in them and i truly feel they are just glorified hard candy. They didn't work for me and as I was sitting in my hair appt. sucking on a lollipop it all seemed a little juvenile. I did buy the preggie pop drops which eliminates the need for the lollipop so it's a little more discreet. If I had it all to do over i would just buy some organic, naturally sweetened hard candies and call it a day. I ended up having a special tincture mixed for me by my local herbalist called 'pregnancy nausea relief' and it worked like a charm. Unlike the preggie pops, I do know what is in my tincture.
