review/text: I have owned a Nuzzle for about 10 years. Dogs LOVE it and don't want you to stop the massage; when you do, they give you adoring, pleading looks until you start again. I've used it on three different breeds all to rave doggie reviews. Of course one can't leave it where a dog can get it and naturally chew it up.Also can be used on humans and cats. Everyone should have this item and be massaging their pets. Also makes a nice gift!
