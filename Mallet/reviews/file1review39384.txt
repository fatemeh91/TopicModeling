review/text: First of all, one size fits all is not the case for this product! I am a 32/34 band size and it was far too big for me. I wouldn't suggest even trying this product unless you are at least a 36/38 band size. It did absolutely nothing for my posture! It doesn't straighten your back up and correct posture, all I would think that it'd do (for people that it fits) is pull your shoulder back a tiny bit, but it wouldn't make you stand up straight. Not worth my money at all. Being returned asap!
