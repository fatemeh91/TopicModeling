review/text: This foot bath HEATS the water, as well as maintains the temperature! The heat light goes off when the water reaches 115 degrees, and comes back on when the temperature drops. Having suffered for months with a Conair foot bath that always got cold, to feel the water get warmer is a true delight!The jets push the warm water over your toes, and your feet feel WONDERFUL after you use it! The rollers are not too high profile, so they are enjoyable to roll your feet over. The nubs on the bottom of the foot bath are great for massaging the soles of your feet, and the pumice stone is perfect to rub away the now-softened dead skin, leaving your feet WARM and happy!You do NOT need to add oils or salts to this foot spa. It will only clog the air jets and prevent you from fully enjoying the LUXURY your feet will experience!The drain plug has not one, but TWO o-rings to prevent leaking, so do NOT torque it down, just LIGHTLY snug it until it stops. You should not experience plug damage if you simply treat it with a bit of care.Yes, it's a bit pricey compared to the others, but you truly DO get what you pay for, and if you want a GOOD foot bath that HEATS the water, and has great air bubbles, this is one investment you will not regret. Your feet are worth it. They support you your entire life, return the favor!
