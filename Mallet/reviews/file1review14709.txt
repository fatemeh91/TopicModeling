review/text: The instructions indicate starting with the smaller end first, which really confuses me. My weak pelvic floor muscles make it near impossible for me to grasp the small end, so instead I've been using the large end. By using the large heavy end first, I'm able to more easily grasp the weight and use my kegels to keep it from slipping out. Hopefully once my pelvic floor muscles are stronger, I can flip it around and hold all of the weight by just the small tip...makes more sense for me this way.
