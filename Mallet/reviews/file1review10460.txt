review/text: Not only do these taste the best out of all the flavors I tried, but they don't have as many - or in some cases any, I think - of the artificial dye chemicals that the colored Tums have. As a pregnant woman who goes through 7-10 of these A DAY on average, it's important to me that a) I'm putting any unnecessary chemicals into my system that can harm my developing baby,and b) these things taste decently! The only problem with them is they're difficult to find in the stores.
