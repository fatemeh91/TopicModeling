review/text: Takes about 5-10 minutes to fill each week, but I've been using it for a couple months and it has kept me organized and on-track with my medicines better than anything I had before. Don't worry about the compartments not being large enough... Each day has 4 separate slots and each slot can hold about 8 pills or so. Overall a very good find for anyone who likes being organized with their medication regimen.
