review/text: I learned of timed release Melatonin from my MD about 2 years ago. I knew about Melatonin and while it did help me fall asleep, it did not keep me asleep. Timed release is the key. It worked from the first day and it is still working 2 years later. If you do have a night when you wake up at 2am, it's great because you can pop another one (I do 1/2), and still wake up refreshed. It does not give me that groggy feeling the next day. I was happy to find the Natrol here on Amazon because it is not an easy product to find. GNC has their brand but Natrol is a better bargain and works just as well. No tax and no shipping on Amazon...can't beat it.
