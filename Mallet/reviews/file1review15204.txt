review/text: This is one of my favorite "fall back" flavors of protein bar, among all brands. Why?1. They don't melt. I can leave one in my car for quick and efficient calories after a workout.2. Nice chocolate fix. If you eat many energy bars, you know that if the flavor includes the word "brownie" that its really not going to taste like a brownie, it will approximate the flavor as best as it can. Fortunately for Balance, their Almond Brownie flavor actually does pretty well in that regard. It is dense and fudge-like in its consistency with small almond chunks. You could let your mind wander for a minute and possibly think that you are eating a heavy brownie.The ingredients are not great, what with the sugar and artificial junk that's in it, but I don't eat them every day and neither should most people. They really are a candy bar with protein and vitamins, not a substitute for real food.For reference, my other favorite protein bar varieties in the non-melty category are: Luna Toasted Nuts & Cranberry, Luna Sesame Raisin (now discontinued), Clif Mojo (both varieties, all natural which is nice), ProMax Oatrageous Chocolate Chip PB flavor (this one is all natural and pretty tasty).
