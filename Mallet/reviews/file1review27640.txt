review/text: Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Whey is great. The company doesn't lie and the protein powder is great. I'm actually writing this review because there's just something weird going on with this flavor. It tastes funky, I don't think I'd recommend it, and now I have 75 servings left to finish. Tastes a little like ground up cookie crisp with a weird aftertaste, not like the oreo milkshake that I was going for. Anyway, just my two cents. The stuff is still super useful for hitting my daily protein intake.On the other hand, Vanilla ice cream and extreme milk chocolate both taste pretty great mixed with skim milk. Mixing with coconut or almond milk is pretty tasty too, but I wouldn't recommend mixing with water if you're sensitive at all to taste/texture. It makes the powder super watery and not that tasty. But you do what you gotta do.
