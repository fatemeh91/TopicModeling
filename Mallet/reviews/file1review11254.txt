review/text: Ricola has changed the sweetener in its products. In the past, the ingredient list included sugar or honey; now it lists "starch syrup." Because I had used the drops many times in the past with no ill effects, I did not check the label, trusting that the product was the same as it had been. When I became ill with all the symptoms associated with a reaction to corn, I read the label and then contacted the company to ask what kind of starch was used. I received a response that the syrup was "derived from corn." I believe this is deceptive labeling and would advise anyone with a corn allergy not to use this product.
