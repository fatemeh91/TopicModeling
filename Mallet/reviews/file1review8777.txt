review/text: I absolutely love this product! If you check out my other reviews you will see I don't rave about everything. I use one scoop with 4 strawberries, a few blueberries, 2 table spoons of yogurt, 4 baby carrots, a small piece of celery, and a cup of water each morning. This mixture tastes delicious like a milk shake, keeps me full until lunch time (which allowed me to lose 5 stubborn pounds), and gives me so much energy I am able to go without coffee. I have tried making this drink without the Green Vibrance and my energy level is just not the same. This is also the 4th green drink I have tried and no other compares. This is now a staple for me.
