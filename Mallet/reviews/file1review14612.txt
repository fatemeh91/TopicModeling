review/text: The Lin review from 2007 pretty much nailed the description of this product, except that mine did not have a strong smell. If they are from the same manufacturing run, 5 years is plenty of time for plasticizers to outgas, which would explain the lack of odor with mine.The casting is thin-walled low density polyethylene. I can see some small scrape marks where they tried to remove roughness. But the casting is bad, and there is really no way to salvage the product. If the maker had upgraded the product during production, for example doubling the wall thickness, this could have been a better product.I'm going to try loading some closeup photos of the product. If they get posted, you will see what I mean.
