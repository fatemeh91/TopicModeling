review/text: I'm amazed at the great reviews - I really don't understand it. The product works for me while it's in my mouth; but eventually I can't help but swallow and soon it's gone. I may feel better for a couple of minutes as there is still residual product in my mouth but eventually, my dry mouth is totally back and I need more. What good is that? I can't be doing that all day; it's a little difficult to carry on a conversation. That's not a fix. The manufacturers claim it lasts up to 8 hours??! I'm trying to think how it might work in the people who claim it lasts that long for them. Does it cause some transformation in the salivary gland cells? My dry mouth is medication caused and it makes my life misery. I wish there was a product out there that worked. I'd be happy if it lasted half an hour.
