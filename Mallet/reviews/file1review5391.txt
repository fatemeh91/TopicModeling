review/text: Yes the quality of the floss itself could be better but the design and the convenience is great. I have one in each bathroom, night tables, in the car (after a meal out) in my purse, in my desk at work in a case. I just love these things. My dentist says since I'm flossing more I have less stuff to come off in a cleaning. good news there!
