review/text: This neck wrap by The Happy Company is one of the best purchases I have ever made. I can heat it up, put it on, and walk around the house doing my chores. Or, I can wear it while driving my van when it is cold to keep my arthritic neck loosened up on my way to wherever I'm going. Wonderful!
