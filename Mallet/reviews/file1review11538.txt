review/text: I'm reading a lot of bad reviews of these batteries but I have to say that my experience is much different. I have bought two sets of these - 16 batteries, and they're performing very well. Initially they might only hold 2300 mAH, but after a few charges I've had these holding over 3000 mAH. Leakage? It simply hasn't been an issue for me. I use these in remotes, a cordless keyboard, and a Garmin GPS and I'm pleased with the results.So why is my experience different compared to all of the bad reviews? I wonder if it has anything to do with my charger? Now I don't know what other people are using, but I did not go the route of finding a cheap charger or a charger that races to get the job done the quickest. I invested in, and given the price and my desire to use rechargables I do mean "invested", a La Crosse Technology charger.These chargers let you choose how much current you want to charge with, whether you want it to discharge first, have it go through a discharge-refresh cycle, or just do a straight-up charge. It measures voltage and total energy in, which is why I know how much I'm putting into my batteries.My experience with my La Crosse is that all of my rechargeables charge right up there. I continue to use batteries I bought eight years ago. There's no memory effect thanks to the discharge-refresh cycle, and I'm seeing all of my batteries get more than their rated mAH capacity. These Duracells have been especially good for me.If you're going to use NiMH, you should consider the charger you use if you really want to get the best return on your investment. Now if you're in the camp of having a really good charger and have bad experiences with the Duracell, then fair enough. My own experience is that they're great and maybe I've just gotten really lucky twice.
