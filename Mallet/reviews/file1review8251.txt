review/text: This brush is ideal for cleaning the inside of reusable liquid containers. It will clean where no other tool can even reach. Case in point: I have a very old Alladin thermos bottle, which I use for coffee and soup. Even though it's stainless steel, I could not get that coffee smell out of it, despite filling it with detergent and boiling water and letting it sit for several days. When I used this brush to clean it, and really scrub the inside of the bottle, including the underside of the spout, the odor disappeared. This is a well-designed, well-made, inexpensive product that works very well...I highly recommend it.
