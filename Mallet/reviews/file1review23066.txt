review/text: I bought one of these at a local big-box store on closeout- it is OLD technology to be sure, but it is a terrific thing to have around. You have no idea how much you will use it- when there are a few pieces of carpet fuzz, pet hair, or crumbs on the floor- whooosh! they are gone. I like it so much I bought 5 more from Amazon to give every household one as a family Christmas gift!!We recently moved into a new house w/ darker laminate flooring and carpeting. When the crumbs and lint show up I grab the Bissel, and clean them up fast without all the hassle of getting out the vacuum, plugging it in etc. It works equally well on our thicker wall to-wall carpeting and our low-nap area rugs, since it is self-adjusting as far as height. It cleans up faster and better than a broom and dustpan, too.No batteries, no recharging- whoooosh!!!
