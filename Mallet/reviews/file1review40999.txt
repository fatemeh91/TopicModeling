review/text: I have been using the All detergent for the past two weeks before reviewing it; I purchased it based upon the other review, which indicated that stains were lifted out and not much fragrance was left in clothes. Both of these observations are true in my experience as well. I garden for a hobby, and my clothes are often very, very dirty. This product will get your clothes clean. I don't particularly want any fragrance in my clothes, so I am happy that there isn't a residual smell. I have also tried the product with cold water, and it will dissolve in cold washes. Finally, if you purchase this product when Amazon runs a coupon special (see the Sales & Special Offers section), plus get super saver shipping, the per washload cost runs around 9 cents a load, which is pretty good.
