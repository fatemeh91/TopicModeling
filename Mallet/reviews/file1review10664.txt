review/text: It works. I am very allergic to poison ivy. If I use it immediately after contact, I will not get a rash. This product has changed how poison ivy affects me. I am very sensitive and I use it often, if I feel any kind of itch. I sometimes get small patches, but no more all-over, mind bending cases.
