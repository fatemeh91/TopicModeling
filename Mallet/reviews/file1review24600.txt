review/text: I really love this product but like others i do not take the recommended dose. I would be jumping out of my skin if I did. When i am dieting i take one in the morning and one at lunch. None for dinner or i would be up all night long. I dont credit the pill for reducing the weight but i will give it 10 stars for giving me the energy i need to excercise which leads to the weight loss. I work an extremely long and stressful day and then i have an hour long drive home. By the time i get home i feel like i could pass out and sleep for days i am so tired, especially when on a reduced calorie diet. When i take the two pills a day it gives me the perfect amount of energy i need to make it through the day with enough energy at the end of the day to put in a 30-60 minute workout and still be able to sleep at night. I think everyone should listen to their body and adjust the dose as needed. Anything over 2the pills a day makes my heart do the tango but the amount i am taking does not give me any problems.
