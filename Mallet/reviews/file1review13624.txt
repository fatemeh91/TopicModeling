review/text: We have used these flossers for many years. Fred Meyer Wallgreen's and Wall Mart no longer carry them. I have always hated flossing but this product is really handy and easy to use. My dental checkups have had much better results and the hygienist noticed how much better my teeth are soon after starting to use the Humming Bird. No, they are not a trained bird that sits on your lip. Ha!
