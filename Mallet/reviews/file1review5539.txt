review/text: I can't say anything bad about this product other than after many years of using it (must be between 5 and 10 years) it has worked pretty solidly. I don't do crazy cuts, but trim my hair, beard or chest every so often. It has done the job and without fail until this year. Something wrong with the plug connecting to the machine or something mechanical on the inside. So I am looking to buy the same one and I hope it will last for another decade. I will come back to review it then if it fails for some reason.
