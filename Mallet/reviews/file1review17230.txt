review/text: I had owned several Panasonic trimmers previously (really liked that they plugged in w/o a charger), and had hoped to buy another; but they have been discontinued. After reading reviews, I bought the MB-200. Great choice. Multiple guard settings, excellent blades, and a battery which holds a charge for at least 15 uses (no more daily charging). Only complaint is that I wish it were a little more compact (it's the size and weight of a large tube of toothpaste). Outstanding value for the price; additional features like turbo-vacuum hold little appeal for me. Recommend enthusiastically.
