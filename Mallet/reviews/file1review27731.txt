review/text: I've tried a few protein shakes on the market. I've heard great things about ON Gold Standard and their quality. I had been taking some Intek Evolution protein, which has great ingredients, and tastes amazing (I look forward to my post-workout shake). However, at $60/5lb jug, it was getting pretty pricey.I accidentally ordered two jugs in the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor (wanted the Double Chocolate which i hear is decent). It's not that the ingredients aren't good, I can't STAND the flavor. It's by far the worst tasting whey protein I have ever had. I've tried everything, water, milk, almond milk, soy milk, even adding a bit of cocoa powder to it. Nothing. I now dread my post-work out shake. I cry to myself every time I see the unopened jug sitting there, waiting for me to reluctantly open it and consume the hellish powder that lurks inside. I'd give it away to someone but that's just plain cruel.If you don't care about flavor, or simply have some sort of strange, mutilated taste buds, go ahead and get the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor. It's cheap. However, i'd rather spend double the price for something I can stand. With Intek Protein, I found myself enjoying it to satisfy my sweet tooth, it was the perfect desert drink. Not so much of Gold Standard. Very Sad.
