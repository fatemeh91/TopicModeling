review/text: Just like previous posters, I usually use water based lubricants because they are safe to use with the flesh light. I purchased KY Intrigue thinking that all of KY's products were water based and unfortunately I was wrong. It takes more lubricant to achieve the same effect as the water based blends that KY uses. After several applications I still experienced friction as if I did not use any lube at all. I recommend to stick to water based lubricants.
