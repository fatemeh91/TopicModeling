review/text: More importantly, the product works. I previously used mri black powder with my workouts but took a break from it as I didn't want to over supplement myself. With this product, you will want to drink plenty of water, and don't expect it to be a magic pill. I used this with my normal workouts, and even on non-workout days, the results are showing and my body fat level has decreased 2% from previous level leaving me at about 8% body fat (considered very lean), regardless I am still on my last week of it, so I have not finished. It is 9 pills per pack, which is only the slighest hassle, no big deal. It gives good energy and no crashes. It does contain caffeine, but the more important ingredients are in the thyroid complex as well as the green tea extract.
