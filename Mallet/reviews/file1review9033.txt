review/text: I've been taking green vibrance for 3 years and i swear by it. The taste is acceptable i've had worse but the benifits far out weigh the taste. The reason i started taking Green Vibrance was for the probiotic's and the greens and i have not been disappointed. When i am off Green Vibrance for a while i notice the difference, i am sluggish, i loose my regularity. When i am on it i am regular as clock work an feel great. Maintaining colon health is very important to me, i have tried many products and Green Vibrance is at the top of my list highly recomended//tz
