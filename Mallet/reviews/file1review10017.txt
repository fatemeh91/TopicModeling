review/text: No guessing or benefit of the doubt here. Exactly and quickly measures body fat for any age and gender. Will track 3 people complete with records. Know your fat % in about a minute. I'm a mid 30's dad who always lifted weights, so with bigger muscles it helped to look "in shape" even when my waist went up to 36". Testing with Fat Track every week was awesome! I went to a 31" Calvin Klein jeans, (working out OF COURSE)still weighing about 200 pounds. How awesome THAT felt! Better than high school, baby! For my wife too! It REALLY helps to see the results a week after you don't exercise and eat that fried seafood dinner, or go nuts with the chocolate fudge! Your fat % goes UP over the next week or so! Get motivation from exercise...you see the results. We lost ours and I'm ordering another one because BOTH of us are gaining weight now without it...that tells me it REALLY makes a difference. (We must lie to ourselves, but Fat Track tells us the horrible-or terrific- truth.)
