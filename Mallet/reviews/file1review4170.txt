review/text: This product gives the best shave ever. There are 5 blades, all parallel to each other, which is the secret to the close shave. Each blade is sharper than the one above it. The first blade, which is the least sharp, functions to pull the hair out of the follicle a bit, then the second blade cuts the hair and pulls on it some more, then the third blade cuts some more and pulls the hair out even further. Finally, before the hair can snap back, the fourth blade moves in, and cuts the wily hair to infinity. My theory is that the fifth blade is just a marketing ploy and it really doesn't do anything. So, if you are willing to spend the money for the closest shave ever, buy this product. Or, if you are out of work because of the economy, you should get a Bic razor from Wal Mart.
