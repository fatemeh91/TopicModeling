review/text: my first online reveiw ever goes out to this amber oil (and oil is almost a misnomer, this one scent was singular in its thickness... almost like a resin). If you have ever smelled other perfumes or oils named 'amber' or having that describe a 'note' of the scent... this is the olfactory 'real thing' you've been craving. will be a repeat customer again and again.I also tried a couple musks and patuollis (sp?) and loved them too. i mixed indian patuolli with the amber today, and i cant get enough of myself (sniff sniff). literally one drop of each rubbed together between the wrists is all it took. application was 3 hours ago and scent is still going strong. DONT GET ME STARTED ON THE PRICES!!! FOR THE QUALITY I ALMOST FEEL LIKE I GOT ONE OVER ON THE COMPANY. AWESOME PRODUCT.
