review/text: After reading the reviews here I felt that I had something to contribute so decided to post my own experience after 3 years of use with this product.1) I am on my third broken unit. The units last less than one year. The company is not responsive when the unit fails and will not sell you replacement heads. The gears are made of nylon and the inherent weakness results in the gears stripping. The unit plugs quickly and is difficult to clean. When it heats up it is less effective because the gears no longer grab as well.2) The unit is fairly slow overall. Much slower than shaving. If you are doing your full legs for the first time expect a couple of hours worth of work. I have dark hair and a lot of it, so perhaps less time for others..but it is SLOW. Prohibitively slow.3) The unit is a little awkwardly shaped which makes it difficult to get into the nooks and crannies.4) This unit is comparatively very expensive and the durability makes it not worth the investment.5) The shaver attachment is worthless and the brush that comes with it for cleaning the head loses its stiffness and no longer effectively cleans out the head.The positive is that this is a dual head system and it is effective at pulling even very short hairs or very course hairs. I would continue using it if the product was more durable and perhaps faster.
