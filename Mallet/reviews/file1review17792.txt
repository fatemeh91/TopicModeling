review/text: I've been taking this multivitamin for years now. It has great liquid sources of B12, vitamin D, Omega 3, copper, iodine, etc. I can feel the effect of the vitamin literally minutes after taking it. It helps me feel positive and relaxed more than any vitamin I've ever taken, possibly because of the easily absorbed liquid form!
