review/text: Wish I could give this zero stars. This is a homeopathic product. If you don't know what that means look it up. There's nothing useful in it and they do give you a clue to that affect where they say it "contains no harsh chemicals". I didn't catch this little detail when I ordered it. Probaby the biggest scam of the modern era. And people keep buying this stuff!
