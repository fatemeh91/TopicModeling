review/text: Before I started using this foot cream, I was using one with an AHA. But this one is much better. The consistency and texture reminded me of Corn Huskers Lotion. For four nights in a row, I applied it at bedtime and put socks over my feet. I was very surprised at how well it worked. My heels are very dry and cracked and this really helped. I noticed a difference after just one night of use. It also seems to work for a long time, even after I took my socks off in the morning. It takes a while to soak into the skin but once it does, the finish isn't greasy -- it's almost powdery feeling. The package said that I need to use only a dab, but I had to use quite a bit more than that. All in all, I'm very pleased with the product and would buy it in the future--but I wish it came in a bigger tube.
