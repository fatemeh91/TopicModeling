review/text: Got this for my mother so that she can be more diligent in taking her pills. The compartments are big enough to fit all of her pills for the day. It is also easy for her to open unlike some other pill cases. The color coordination is nice also. And she likes the convenience of just taking one case with her in her purse for the day.
