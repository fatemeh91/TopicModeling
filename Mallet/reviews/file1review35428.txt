review/text: We just moved into a forclosure house that sat for years. The water here is very hard and the inside of the dishwasher was disgusting and crusty with calcium deposits. I even hesitated to put our dishes in to wash them because I thought it might make them dirtier. One of the many workmen who have been through here recommended Dishwasher Magic and he was right. I ran two bottles through the dishwasher and it looks like new! Amazing and worth every penny.
