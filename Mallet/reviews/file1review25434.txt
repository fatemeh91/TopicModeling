review/text: years ago, i bought this nose hair trimmer for my husband. it's awesome. however, eventually it finally broke and a part went missing. we have purchased 5 different, and some very expensive trimmers since that never matched up to this one. my husband was thrilled when he finally found his "original" trimmer. still works great, don't waste your money on more expensive models.
