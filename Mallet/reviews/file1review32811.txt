review/text: SummaryGreat for busy artists, students and those who don't have time to prepare meals. Tastes great with homemade kefir, frozen strawberries and stevia but not palatable mixed as instructed.Pros:Easy to prepare with a blenderDecent nutritional valueNot too expensiveThick and frothy when blended with frozen fruitQuite fillingConsCan taste salty with milk aloneNotes:Comes with a measuring scoopVery small cannistersDetailedI realize this is a weight loss product but as a busy art student, there are simply days when I don't have enough time to sleep let alone eat. Rather than not eat (which happens quite often) I decided to try a product that serves as a meal replacement then try it out to see how it is and tastes.Upon receiving the package I was a bit surprised at how tiny the canisters were even though each has 14 servings. Still, it's a good start for a meal replacement and costs around $0.70 per serving as prepared in this review. And that's the catch. Why I deducted a star is because PREPARATION makes this either tasty or disgusting.Straight out of the box with milk and blended it pretty much looks and tastes like pepto bismol. In other words, absolutely yuck with a salty taste (yes there's salt in this product). But by filling up my blender cup with 2 cups of water first, then using some Stevia, pouring on the mix and powdered milk then adding frozen strawberries blending with my immersion blender I get a very nice, very thick strawberry cheesecake like shake that not only fills me up but honestly tastes great.I have also tried replacing a cup of milk with kefir (or powdered milk in my case) and it came out delicious!Conclusion:Despite the downsides, all in all, it's a much healthier and tastier outlook than starving to death at the drafting table. And it is as easy though not nearly as sinful and fattening as heating up a frozen pizza.
