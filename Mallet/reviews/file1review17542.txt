review/text: This works like a dream compared to the old Norelco I've been using for the past 15 years or so. Good power and blade speed, convenient height adjustment mechanism that stays in place once set. A single charge seems to last forever. Would have preferred the on/off switch to be located on the opposite side of the body where I could operate with my thumb (being right-handed) but this is a nit.
