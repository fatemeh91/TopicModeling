review/text: I don't usually rate products because everybody has their own brand or product they like. But for me whose looking to become lean and maintain a good muscle mass this is fantastic choice. In addition of taking Optimum Nutrition Pro Complex and 100 % casein. It provides a 24 g of protein and with 5 grams of BCAA. You can take it before workout, after workout or even when you need some Protein in your system. Overall, great product, great taste and if you want to make it better add milk and slice of banana for even greater taste.
