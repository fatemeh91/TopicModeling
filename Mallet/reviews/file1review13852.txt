review/text: We use this almost every night with our 2 month old baby girl. When she's fussy or gassy, this helps her out almost immediately.Just be careful to only put it in for 15 seconds. Any more than that and it starts to expand and I'm sure it would melt completely. Also, be careful of touching the eyes and nose right away while it's still in the microwave...those can get hot but cool down in a few seconds.
