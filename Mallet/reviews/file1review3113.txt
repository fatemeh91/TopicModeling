review/text: Awful experience with the seller "Green Web Inc.". I placed an order on Nov. 14 but never received my item. I contacted the seller on November 19. I got a response on November 21. They informed me that there was an "unexpected" delay. I contacted them again to say that I would not cancel my order if they were 100% sure I could get my item by December 3, almost 3 weeks after I placed the order (I am patient). They said ok. Then, on November 28, I received an email from Amazon confirming the item had shipped. On December 4, as I had not received anything I contacted the seller again. They answered on Dec. 5 and explained that the item would leave their facility the same day (Dec. 5). What??? They told Amazon they had shipped my item on November 28! Would they be liars?? Probably. Why? Well so you don't cancel your order.I filed a claim w/ Amazon on Dec. 5. This seller doesn't have (all?) his products in stock and doesn't communicate honestly. They lie so you don't cancel your order. They mess around & play w/ buyers. Bad! Bad! Very poor customer service! They don't contact you if you don't contact them first! The price is good but not worth the awful experience and all the seller's lies. This is the reason why I gave 1 star. Please, be aware that I am not rating the product. I am rating the service and the seller (Green Web Inc.). Find another seller if you want your items in a reasonable amount of time.
