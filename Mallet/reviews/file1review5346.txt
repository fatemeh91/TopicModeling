review/text: Jointflex is one of the products out there that certainly helps relieve pain. Both my husband and I use it on our backs and also leg areas where pain persists from day to day. It does relieve the pain and make it easier to move. We both have herniated disks and although it is not an alternative to procedures recommended, it does help to alleviate the pain and ease walking and sitting or standing. Also it does not have an overpowering smell like some products. The smell dissipates very quickly which is a plus.
