review/text: To all the people complaining about it being scratched up and thinking its a "display model"...Its called STREET chrome for a reason, any zippo will get scratched up over time in your pocket, this just beats you to the punch. also for those complaining about it not lighting...1. It doesn't ship with fuel in it and you have to buy it separately its just the law get used to it.2. read up on proper use and maintenance of an item before you buy it.Other than that, this is a good lighter, its just not as user friendly as the disposable bic lighters, and you need a bit of common sense to get its full value. If you don't feel like refueling and occasionally re-flinting/wicking your lighter this isn't for you.
