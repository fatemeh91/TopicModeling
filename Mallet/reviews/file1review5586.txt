review/text: I have some area between my teeth that catch food and are wider the dental tape. This product comes in multiple sizes and is literally a small brush to clean between your teeth. They need a handle to hold them & you can reach all spaces inside you mouth. I got my first one from my dentist. I like them so much, I found them on the internet & have continued to use them.
