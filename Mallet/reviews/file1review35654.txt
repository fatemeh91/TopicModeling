review/text: I bought this through drugstore.com because I had a credit (for those who might notice I'm not a certified buyer from amazon)I've had sunspot on my cheek for some years now, it's about the size of a dime and is always at least somewhat noticeable even with makeup caked over it.I have fair skin so most imperfections are obvious but after a few years and a lot of outside activities it was getting worse. I'm not sure where I heard about this stuff but I decided I've blown money on dumber things so I'd give it a go.Conclusion: I am actually having a lot of luck with it. I've had it for a month or two and the spot is easy to cover and even uncovered its much less noticeable.I don't use it regularly, if I have to work I won't put it on in the morning because it takes a bit of time to dry well enough that my makeup can go over it, it also smears onto my pillow a lot because I forget and don't put in on until right before I lay down. Even with my sporadic use it works well on my skin and it's not too much so I would say it's worth it to try.
