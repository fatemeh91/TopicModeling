review/text: I'm in my fifties and am pretty average with few exceptions. One exception, though, is that I tend to experience the side-effects of medications rather severely. Therefore, I seldom take medications of any kind so I am sure there were none in my system to counter act with this product in a negative way. Nevertheless, after a couple of weeks, my navel itched non-stop. I checked myself: same soap, same bubble bath, same laundry detergents, etc. The only new thing in my life was this product. I stopped taking it and the navel stopped itching in less than 48 hours. Several months have passed with no more itching. It could just be me so that's why I gave it 2 stars rather than 1. However, I thought I should mention my reaction in case someone else gets the same problem.
