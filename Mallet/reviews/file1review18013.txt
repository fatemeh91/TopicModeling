review/text: Maybe it is because I am a petite woman with a smaller head, but I found this mask to be unbelievably uncomfortable. First off, the velcro in the back is thick and stiff and it went across the entire back of my head making it really difficult to sleep on my back. The eye part is over sized and kept pushing down over my nose. I've had prior sleep masks that had Velcro but didn't use such a stiff, thick, long strip of it. To make it small enough to fit, I'm probably going to have to cut the Velcro bits off and sew it together. As it is this mask won't stay on and with the Velcro makes sleeping impossible.
