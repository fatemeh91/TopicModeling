review/text: I have used this product for years.I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia and the doctor also had it.I found this spray after going through all the other pills that didn't work. I found much relief in this spray. I can get more sleep at night when I spray before bed on my joints. It smells like peppermint but that dissapates and you get relief.It's a little cold going on but theat goes away.It's worth a try! I keep a supply of this.It's very hard to find in stores and I think Amazon has the best prices for the bigger bottle. I ordered my last one through the hospital pharmacy who had never heard of it.I let the clerk try it and she said her wrist didn't hurt like before.So I give this product a big thumbs up!
