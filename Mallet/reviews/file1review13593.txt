review/text: My husband was on cholesterol meds and every one didn't work and worse had bad side effects. The doctor kept switching from one to another with the same bad result. I researched natural healing methods, stopped his meds. I didn't tell him, started him on cinnamon. He went to his doctor for a bloodwork check and his doctor said wow we finally have your level lowered by half! My husband and the doctor were so surprised to find out he was off the meds for over 6 months and supplementing with cinnamon. We will stay with this natural method as I recently heard statin drugs cause heart issues, hardening of the arteries.
