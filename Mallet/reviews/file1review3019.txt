review/text: The price of these condoms combined with the speed of the shipping are the only reasons this product received two stars. The reviews stating that these condoms feel like nothing are overexagerating. These condoms fit too snugly and feel like a raincoat. Additionally, the condoms are lightly lubricated so that if you last more than 5 minutes you have to stop and apply more lubrication. This can ruin the atmosphere and sometimes the mood. Anyways I will be keeping the last six of these condoms for emergencies and my gf and I will keep searching for the perfect condom.
