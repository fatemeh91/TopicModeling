review/text: Yes, these may show a little more than disposable pads, but most of the time you're not wearing skin-tight tops while you're breastfeeding. These did not slip around me unlike disposables and were much softer to wear. I never planned that the pads should last all day/night, I tended to change pads at every feeding so I never ended up leaking through these. For &quot;sticking&quot;, I had the same problem with some disposables; it happens when you leak and don't change the pad (and it dries, thus the sticking). I preferred buying 2 sets of the washables instead of continually buying disposables and adding to the landfill problem.
