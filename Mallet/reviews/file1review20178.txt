review/text: I was recommended this product to deal with arthritis and joint pain. I used the product for 3 weeks going through 4 bottles.It taste pleasantIt is easy to useI felt no benefit at allI suffer from fibromyalgia and it is possible for someone suffering from rheumatoid arthritis or other joint inflammation this would work quite well.
