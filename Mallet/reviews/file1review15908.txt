review/text: I never got to wear this because it was so hard to assemble especially if your by yourself with a 7 month belly. I tried to have my husband assist but we both got so frustrated with it. I would suggest just buying a band that goes under your belly and does not have 3 or 4 different parts to apply around your belly.
