review/text: I don't even get this thing. Today, I picked it up to go at a pan that had rice stuck to the bottom. Was thinking I would need to scrape with something metal. This thing took out most of it.The other part that's amazing is it doesn't get all gunked up or worn down.Huge success here, OXO. Thanks!
