review/text: My 2-year-old is a little scared of new things. So, you can imagine how hard it is to get him to try an adult size toilet in a public restroom.We used theBaby Bjorn Potty Chair(great product, as well!) to get him started . He figured out the routine within 3 days, but when I had to travel with him, he refused to use other potties or any toilet seat covers (padded or folded). If I was lucky enough to get him to sit on the other seats, they would move or the pee guard didn't seem high enough, so my toddler and I would be nervous about him sitting on there for long. I had to take the potty seat with me everywhere I went... to family members' houses, to parties, and to the grocery store. I was sneaking my son out to my car every time he had to pee. And when we finally decided to go without the potty seat while we were entertaining friends in downtown Chicago, my son was more comfortable peeing in his pants than any toilet in CHI-town.Then I bought the Baby Bjorn Toilet Trainer and no more potty in the trunk. It fits into the diaper bag and since it's adjustable, it fits all toilets securely. When my son sits on it, he can change positions as many times as he wants and he doesn't feel like he's going to fall in. I think it really helps that it is white like the toilet as well. He gets such a satisfied look on his face when he pees on the BIG toilet.
