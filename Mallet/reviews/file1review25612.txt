review/text: I've had one of these for about a year. It worked fairly well for several months, but then went into a slow decline in which it occasionally yanked hairs instead of trimming. The blades just get dull. It's not all that easy to clean, which doesn't help things. For this price however I suppose it's hardly unexpected, and buying a new one every 9-12 months isn't the worst deal in the world. I do feel sorry for the woman who bought one for her husband who hates it. Her heart is in the right place.
