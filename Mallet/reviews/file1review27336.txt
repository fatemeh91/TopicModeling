review/text: Okay, so I've been using ON Whey for a while. I feel like it gives me a little more bang for the buck compared to the traditional store brands (especially since it includes the BCAAs).My only complain--which I admit might be completely in my head--is that the chocolate/coffee/whatever flavors that ON makes don't mix anywhere near as well as the fruit flavors. Typically, the "heavier" flavors leave lots of unmixed globs no matter how well you shake up your serving. Meanwhile, the "lighter" flavors tend to mix rather well.Pretty minor complaint, though. If you're trying to build some muscle, I suggest ON over any other brand. It's hard to beat for the price.
