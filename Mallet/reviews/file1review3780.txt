review/text: I have been using Mag 07 for about 9 months now and I wouldn't give it up! It works and works well. After years of not eliminating regularly I was really surprised at how much there is that needs to come out. I take 4 capsules almost every night. I have had no problems or side affects. At first when you use it you need to find your dosage that works for you. Taking too much however does not make it so you cannot control yourself or make you not able to leave the bathroom for a day. It is also not gas producing.
