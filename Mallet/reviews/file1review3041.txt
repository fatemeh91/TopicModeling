review/text: I LoveD bare,I LoveD skyns, MY GIRL LOVES CROWNS and I do too! I was not sure about this product when I purchased it, some users complained about the smell, but it was not really bad. Skyns and Bare had more heat sensation that's why one would feel more sensation, but since HEAT in that area was never a problem for us (let's just say our thermostat down there is on high always) this just rocked our world! This works for me and my girl, so I highly encourage you guys to try it!!!
