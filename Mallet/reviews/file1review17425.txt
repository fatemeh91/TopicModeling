review/text: I am very pleased with this beard trimmer. I was so skeptical about it being so cheap but after using it I am very very pleased. The shape of it and the shape of the attachment make for a really easy clean shave. Something about it's curve and large space of flat comb on the attachment it makes it very easy to use and maneuver. By far the easiest beard trimmer I've ever used.The click wheel for adjusting the length of trim is just brilliant! No more switching attachments! Yes, the combs of the attachment are a little cheaply made and flimsy but they get the job done well!I absolutely recommend this beard trimmer! A+
