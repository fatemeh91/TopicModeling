review/text: I had a lot of trouble screwing together the base with the top as the holes did not line up the best since it was a little bent at the bottom. I had a lot of trouble hooking the weight hook to the base-it stuck up in the column and wouldn't come down. I had a lot of trouble zero-ing the unit-it just did not want to stay stable. (there is no dampening so it swings back and forth a lot) There is no mark for the weight pointer to line up to. I had to make my own which did not look as professional as it would if the manufacturer had made the mark. It does work so I would not send it back. It just took much much longer than expected and was harder than expected to put together. It is very very light weight-so be aware the metal is thin.
