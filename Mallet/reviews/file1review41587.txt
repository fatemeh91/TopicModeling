review/text: Ordered this top of the line Oral-B toothbrush . The online description is very sketchy - there is no way to know what accessories actually come with the toothbrush. Although there were several attachments that come with this toothbrush, there was only ONE toothbrush head. Looking at the photo of the storage/recharge unit, it looked like it might come with a couple of brushheads so that more than one person could use the handle and each have their own brushhead - that's the way the slightly older Oral-B Professional electric toothbrush that I own came. So be aware that if two people plan to use this Triumph toothbrush you are going to have to buy extra brushheads immediately as only one is included.
