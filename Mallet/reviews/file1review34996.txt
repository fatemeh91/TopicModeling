review/text: I have used prylosec for several years for acid reflux and I was concerned about reports I had read as to how it could affect my health. I saw on the internet an add about this product and I decided to give it a try. What a suprise, it does the job, I feel better in my stomack and it is much less costly than the prylosec. Thanks Amazon for a great product!Paul
