review/text: I switched to these after trying a pill my Dr. gave me in the office (samples). After switching to these my morning sickness calmed down a bit and I was able to stomach these easier. I saw others complain about how large the pill is and I do not find them any larger than any other prenatal vitamin/multi-vitamin. I think they are great and I will most deffinately use them through my entire pregnancy. The ONLY down side is this vitamin does not have enough suggested DHA in it. My Dr. has me taking an Omega 3 vitamin (gel caplet) too. I am ok with that.
