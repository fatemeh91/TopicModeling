review/text: I drink ON's Rich Chocolate Whey protein mixed with Silk's Chocolate Soy Milk every morning as a breakfast shake. It fills me up for quite some time and I've even noticed an increase in stamina while completing both cardio and weight training. Just be sure to mix the appropriate powder to liquid ratio or you're sure to have lumps regardless of how good of a shaker/blender you own. Good stuff.
