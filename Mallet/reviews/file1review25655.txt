review/text: This worked great for the first few months that I had it. Then I made the mistake of tapping the removable head on the counter top. I was amazed at all the hair that had accumulated so I kept at it. I think that I knocked the blades out of alignment because it now constantly makes the same sound that it does when cutting hair. It's also become much more likely to nick me. I'm ordering another because of the excellent results I had before I messed it up. This time I'll simply run the blades under the water every couple of weeks instead.Update..The second one screwed up too but i'm still going to keep buying these as they work so well. If I could change the rating to 4 stars I would.
