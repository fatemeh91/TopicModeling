review/text: I bought a case of this about 9 months ago....and we do about 2 loads a week on average and we do have an HE machine. We have finished one bottle and maybe an eighth of another bottle. Whats crazy is we ordered one case...and when it arrived it was leaking everywhere....and about 1 bottle had lost quite a bit of the detergent and 4 out of the 6 were leaking...so we called amazon(thinking they were broken originally and it was a big mess) and they actually sent us another case to replace it(and keep the other). It came the same way...just not as big a mess with somewhat less detergent inside the box....so we got basically got 11 1/2 bottles for the cost of 6...not our intention believe me. We are going to be doing laundry for probably 6 years with what we got. It is a great product with a terribly messy/leaky cap. You have to get ALL the detergent out of the lid when you screw it back on or it creates some sort of weird detergent vacuum which leaks down the handle and onto whatever surface the bottle is on. Other than this....it is a great product that is environmentally friendly, cleans extremely well, smells good and is actually relatively inexpensive through Amazon. Just be prepared to set a towel under the bottle and throw it in with the laundry.....our solution since we dont want to sit and wipe out every little bit out of the cap before capping. I absolutely recommend it.
