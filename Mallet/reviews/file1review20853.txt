review/text: I was skeptical at first by all the negative reviews. I bought it anyways, and this shaver is the best thing I have every gotten. No longer does it take numerous strokes to shave, this shaves so close and with very few strokes. The cleaning unit is loud at times, but whatever it cleans the shaver. This is a great unit.
