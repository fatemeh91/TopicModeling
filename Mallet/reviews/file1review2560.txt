review/text: I have used a Braun silk epil since I was 15, an old one that after 10 years was still working. Last march I moved to the States leaving my epilator in Italy so I was looking for another Braun. But the price of the Philips was so cheap that I decided to give it a shot and I'm very glad I did it. The epilator is perfectly functional and if you don't mind not having a bag or a cap for it it's fine. I dind't use the razor attachment yet but I'm sure it will be a good choice to have two toys at the price of one!Fantastic!
