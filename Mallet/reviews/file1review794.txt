review/text: the keychain is useful and works good, so if you are getting this to tighten up your glasses, its great. but i bought it to replace a cushion on my glasses. the screws are so small you can barely hold them in your fingers let alone secure it in place to try to screw it in,even with someone else helping me. you are better off getting your glasses repaired in a shop. but i do like the keychain.
