review/text: I ordered these vitamins back in March I started to take them right away but not even as often as I was suppose too I took them one a day then skipped a couple days and closer to my husband coming back from Afghanistan I really stop taken them then picked back up like two weeks after him coming home in May. My periods have always been very werid the longest I've ever went with one as been 3 days and no longer than that. So I had one in June from the 16th through the 17th then in July I had it a lil earlier which was weird for me but then I was like okay whatever I never really know when there going to hit and at this point I had got back on schedule to at least taking the vitamins twice a day and at the same time so I wouldn't forget later to take one and I was on my cycle from the 12th till the 15th and it was light not heavy at all and come August I'm waiting for the 12th to start my cycle and nothing so I'm waiting for the 16th and nothing and 12 days after I missed it I got a test I've actually had 3 test and sure enough I'm pregnant 9 weeks along and my first intake is next week!So I'm really excited it worked for me on top of drinking fertil-tea now I have my first lil one on the way and couldn't be more happier and grateful with the results! :)
