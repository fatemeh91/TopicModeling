review/text: Most men will reach the age when they look in the mirror one day and realize there is hair growing from their nose. When this day comes, it is important to remember that, like weed wackers, not all nose hair trimmers are created equal. Cheap cutters will pull the hair from the root. Yes, it leaves your nose smoother than babies' behind, but it's not pleasant. Trimmers that pull end up in the trash or yard sale right next to other creepy items. That having been said, these Panasonic trimmers leave a little bit of hair(maybe 1/8 of an inch) but at the same time, it doesn't usually pull. It's a worthy trade-off, and the cheapest trimmers I've found that don't yank the hairs from the root.
