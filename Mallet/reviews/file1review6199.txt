review/text: I have the newer version of this mop with the lever. At first glance it looks like a great design -- the rollers are flat and squeeze the sponge very tightly. The individual sponge fragments should theoretically give you more working surface and corners.Then they ruined it by putting in some of the least absorbent sponges I have ever seen. Seriously you can put this in a sink and it will float on top for 10 minutes or so without taking on water. You literally have to dunk it and wring/unwring it under the water to get any water out of your bucket.Scrubs great, but unless all you want to do is distribute the filth evenly around the floor, avoid this mop, or bring a second one that can actually get the water back up. But then, what's the point?
