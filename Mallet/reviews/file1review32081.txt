review/text: I carry one of the Tide pens in my purse all the time. When one of my kids drops something on their clothes it takes me about 10 seconds to get it out. It doesn't work as well on really greasy stains, but pretty much everything else comes out without issue. In the past if I was in a public place and one of my kids dropped something on their clothes I had to go to a public bathroom and get my kid all wet. Half the time the stain did not come out. With the Tide pen I just pull it out of my purse and any smallish stain can be taken care of in only a few seconds. No mess at all--makes going places with kids lots easier!
