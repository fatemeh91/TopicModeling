review/text: Good service and shipping. Pads are a little too large for my wife They go from head to foot which may work well for someone else. Probably this length will be good in the summer to asorb the sweat. The main reason for the four star rating is that my two had a slight chemical smell until they were washed a several times. Nothing a person can't live with. However, they seem to work for the purpose intended. Nothing has leaked through.
