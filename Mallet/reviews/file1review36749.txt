review/text: So far it's worked well for me. During the first cycle I've seen a bench increase from around 240 up to 265. Granted I did go from using a standard barbell (1") to an olympic set-up which seems to be better balanced. My one complaint is that the powder tends to head straight for the bottom of the glass or container that it's put in. It seems best to use a small amount of water or juice to down the powder and then follow-up with any additonal water or juice as you so chose.
