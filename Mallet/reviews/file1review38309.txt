review/text: i have been using the braun hair remover for some time now after a my shins were threatening to sue me for manslaughter. i needed a safer way for hair removal.i purchase this after reading reviews. it works better than my braun. after the first time, you don't feel a thing. i'm even now using it on my underarms.the only caution is ingrown hairs, which will happen with any of these types of devices. there are lotions to use to avoid that (look in the men's shaving section).your legs look great, hair grows back finer, and no nicks, scrapes of cuts!
