review/text: The Philips AED is a compact, easy-to-carry unit that demands little of the user. I bought one for home use, and donated another to Planes of Fame air museum, where I work as a volunteer. The device prompts every step, has pictographs showing proper placement or technique, and performs its own diagnostics automatically. It is a simple, effective piece of equipment that can save lives.
