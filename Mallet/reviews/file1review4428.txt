review/text: This has been my default razor for a few years now, but it does tend to leave a little bit of stubble behind. It's not as close as they may advertise and takes a few strokes to get things right. It doesn't irritate my skin and each razor lasts for a fair amount of time, so it's bad, it's just not great.
