review/text: I noticed instant relief from my lower back pain when I started wearing this support. I do wear a maternity tank underneath it because it did chafe a little the first time I wore it without this, but it is very comfortable with the tank underneath. It feels very secure and doesn't slide around or up, even when I sit.
