review/text: I got this brush to wash out my many Nalgene water bottles. Nothing else really does the job quite as well. The bristles are just hard enough to clean inside the threads of the bottle lid and just soft enough not to scratch up the inside of the bottles. Before I got this brush cleaning them was a real chore. Now it's relatively easy. Highly recommended if you have narrow opening bottles to clean.
