review/text: I have worn this ALL the time since about 7 months pregnant. I'm due any day now & still wearing it. It really helps take the strain off my back and hips. I wouldn't consider being on my feet for long or going for a walk without it! It's not &#34;sheer&#34; under clothes, but it's not bulky either - I wear it under t-shirts just fine. It's kind of like a bra - you might see it beneath very lightweight clothing. I also find that I can wear it with our without a tank top beneath - it doesn't rub or itch.
