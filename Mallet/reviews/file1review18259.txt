review/text: Save your money and pass on this lubricant. It doesn't work with or without a condom. It's expensive and pretty much useless -- free saliva work better. It's sticky and doesn't glide well. I'm sure it would be worthless with toys as well, but I didn't try. It is hard to wash off afterwards as well. Pass on this and try something else, there are plenty of better lubes for less money!
