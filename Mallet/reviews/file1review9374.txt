review/text: This was purchsed for an elderly Aunt. The exterior of these individual pill boxes is too slippery; she was unable to hold them and return to the tray. Also, I bought the item because I thought the box lid was separated so that AM and PM could be opened individually. That is not the case; it's in one piece. When when opened, the meds could accidentally be spilled into another section. Great concept but needs some modifications.
