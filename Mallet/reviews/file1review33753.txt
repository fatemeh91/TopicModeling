review/text: The Arch supports are better than I was expecting. The selectable inserts are better than they look. I have been having pain in the heel and the arch just before the heel for the last year or so. I have used other gels and arch supports over the counter products with little help. These surprised me even more after seeing them in person. They look like they are weak and offer very little support, however the function was much better. The pain in me arch and heels almost completly stopped in just a couple days of use. I am on my feet over 12+ hours a day and they have made this much easier to do. After a few weeks of using in my shoes on even very uneven ground the pain is still 95% reduced. Pain I had after standing up after down time is also mostly non existant. These come with three choices of adjustability , by the addition of wedges that insert in the underside of the pad. I have only used the heavy wedges in these , and have not tried the lower ones as they just look like too slight of a change. I am glad I tried these and at this price I would suggest them to others.
