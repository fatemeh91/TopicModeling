review/text: I have been using this product for over two years now. Don't take it every day but when I'm tired, traveling, or just hungover it gives me energy and makes me alert. I keep the small bottle (4 oz) on my desk and refill at home from the 16oz. The taste is very pleasant. I would highly recommend this product.
