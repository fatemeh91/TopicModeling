review/text: I bought these tweezers for removing ingrown hairs that did not come out after I shaved. My regular flat tweezers were not pointed enough to grab them.This product's graphic yellow design makes it more eye-catching than your traditional stainless steel model. I realize the tips have to come to a point to pull splinters or small hairs, but these ended up being a little too sharp. There doesn't end up being enough surface area sometimes to easily grab what your trying to take out.Overall, I like the tweezers and would recommend them.
