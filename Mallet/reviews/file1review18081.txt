review/text: I have 3 of these and love them, but when one strap tore off after 4 months (but only a few uses -- it was my travel mask), Bucky refused to do anything, instead telling me to contact amazon. Normally a manufacturer stands by its products. Fortunately, amazon replaced it (yet another case of impressive amazon service) -- but this is not the way a manufacturer of high-end products should treat its customers.
