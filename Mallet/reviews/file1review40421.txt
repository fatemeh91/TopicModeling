review/text: I already have a beautiful outdoor handmade ramp. However I have 2 2&#34; thresholds into the house and another 8&#34; step from den into kitchen. I am a caregiver and when my sister has difficulty walking I need to use the wheelchair in the house. This ramp makes things so much easier for both she & I. It is so easy to use and not too heavy. I can fold it up & stand it in the breezeway on days when I do not need it. It has helped my back tremondously!!I looked at several websites- found the EXACT same ramp elsewhere- much more expensive.Best thing I ever did for myself
