review/text: I feel its kind of expensive for plastic razor scraper. I pushed really hard and it did not break! I only gave it 4 stars due to price.I had to scraper really really hard on one little spot to get it completely clean for 10 minutes. The burnt on grease cerama bryte remover does not work well. I used the remover liquid with the razor while i was scraping to speed the process. It will take me forever to clean my glass top. 1 rating for the burnt on grease remover cleaning solution.i tested the remover solution for 10, 20, and 30 minutes. I was not impressed!
