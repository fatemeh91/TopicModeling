review/text: My skin is extremely prone to fungal infections. As a result, I almost always have an active fungal infection. I am treating my current infection with an anti-fungal powder in combination with FungaSoap in the shower. I had really hoped that the FungaSoap would be effective in helping to eliminate my current problem as well as helping to keep future infections away. Reading all of the glowing reviews on this page led me to believe that this was a reasonable expectation, but unfortunately I am not having that experience. So far, after three weeks of use, all this product has done for me is cause a rash in a place where there was no skin problem before. At this point, I think I am going to stop using this product. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on two bottles of this stuff that I will not be using again.
