review/text: This is probably the best tool for dental prophylaxis that I have ever owned. Its instructions are easy to follow, the timing signals for each cleaning are immensely helpful, and so is the warning that it is time to change brushes. My dentist approves. It is well worth the price. A cleric/educator I once knew many years ago cited electric toothbrushes as the heighth of consumer laziness, but I find this product a real help to my dental health.
