review/text: I was very surprised by the negative reviews of this dishwasher gel. I've been using this for a few weeks and think it's awesome. Maybe it's because I'm comparing it to the cheapo-toxic Kirkland crap I was buying for years? Anyway, I like the built in rinse aid and have noticed that our glasses are shiny and spotless. No problems with the dishes, everything comes out very clean. How do you think I ended up on this site? I was so impressed with this cleaner that I started looking to see if Amazon had it cheaper and in bulk. Good luck.
