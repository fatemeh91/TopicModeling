review/text: I started shaving in the shower when I was in my early 20s. I grew a beard in my late 20s and I am now 43. Granted I don't have to "shave" but as I've gotten older, shave oil helps tremendously on the neck and cheek line. I tell young bucks to purchase a shower mirror and a good pre-shave oil and dispense with shaving at the sink. SHAVE IN THE SHOWER. I'm bearded and that is what I do. This pre-shave oil is tremendous and all I shave is my neck line and cheeks - I am certain that for men who don't have beards that this product would serve them very well.
