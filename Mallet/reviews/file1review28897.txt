review/text: I have been drinking this for about a week so not long.I like the fact that it's whey protein which is supposedly the most easily assimilated and that it has 24 grams of protein per scoop.I got it in Strawberry which I find completely disgusting.I'm definitely getting chocolate or vanilla next time.
