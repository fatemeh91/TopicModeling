review/text: If you only plan to use it with the guard on, you're probably fine. If you plan to use it without the guard, especially for more intensive / multiple-angle tasks like head shaving, don't buy it. The top is designed so that if any significant pressure is placed on the blade when used in a pretty normal hand position, it can pop open. If it doesn't pop open, the plastic (!) pins in the hinge will break off. (The hinge is to allow you to open the top and clean out the hair around the driving pin.) I owned a prior model and it lasted for seven years of once-weekly head shavings with no guard, plus beard trimming. This version lasted barely six months before the first hinge pin broke, and less than a year before the second one broke, rendering the shaver unusable.
