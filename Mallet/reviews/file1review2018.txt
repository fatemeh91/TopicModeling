review/text: I wore the regulator for the first time last night. It was very comfortable and I awoke with my big to straighter than it's been in a long time. I will be seeing a doctor for my bunions in a couple of weeks. It will be my first visit and I am hoping he will tell me that the regulator will keep me from having surgery on my foot. I'm also hoping it will keep that burning in my foot from returning.
