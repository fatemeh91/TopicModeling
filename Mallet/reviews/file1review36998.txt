review/text: Dry Idea Roll-On Anti-Perspirant & Deodorant has some significant features. The large roll-on head operates smoothly and efficiently, distributing product quickly and evenly. The deodorant dries with amazing quickness and has a pleasing baby-powder scent. It proved effective in its dual antiperspirant/deodorant role by keeping me dry through a number of demanding tasks.
