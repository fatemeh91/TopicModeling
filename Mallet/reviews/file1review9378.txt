review/text: I found this pill organizer though a search on Amazon, put it on my wishlist and received it as a gift this Christmas. I have to say, hands-down, that this is the best pill organizer I have ever owned. It can be dropped and does not break open, and does not open up in my purse. It's well shaped and can even hold a calcium chew in addition to the pills. For those looking for a 3 times day holder, here's what I do- I put ONLY my morning meds in the AM spot, all other medication goes in PM, then when I take my morning meds, I move over any lunchtime meds and it works perfectly.
