review/text: I've been taking two tablets a night for a couple of weeks now and I haven't really noticed any difference in my sleep. I find better results when I just take a valerian tablet. I like that it has magnesium in it, which I'm usually deficient in. It's replaced my calcium-magnesium supplement at night, but that's cheaper than this. I love their Life Force vitamins, but the NutraSleep is just pretty much meh.
