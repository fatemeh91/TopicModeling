review/text: Length:: 1:34 MinsIn this clip, a friend explains his reasons for choosing Nature's Plus W/Whole Food vitamins.He likes the large economy size.He thinks it's a bargain.This is a vitamin he's taken for years and is extremely pleased with. He likes the vitamins and nutrients of this product.To be sure of it's effectiveness, I've taken this vitamin a couple times a day (not three pills per day as instructed) and I did feel energized after a several weeks of taking it regularly.I can honestly say I felt it helped me and I will take this vitamin regularly.I recommend this vitamin highly !
