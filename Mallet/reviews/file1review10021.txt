review/text: Two items came in this package.The first is the Body Fat Caliper.Initially I found it a little quirky but once you get familiar with the procedure it is very simple to use. It is set up to determine percentage body fat based on three skin fold measurements. If you want to use the more involved seven measurement calculation it displays the caliper reading in millimeters which you can use to manually number crunch. Of course the more involved measurements generally require a second person taking the measurements.The second item included is the Mayotape.This is really handy when trying to measure yourself. The end of the tape has a securing point on one side of the handle. As you pull the tape out it will not spool back in until you give it a quick jerk (similiar to positioning a pull down window blind). So you make a big loop that you can put you arm through or put around your chest, give it a jerk and it sucks up around you. Then, simply take the measurement at the edge of the handle. It still requires a little dexterity but alot nicer to use and gives more consistant readings than a loose tape.It would be nice if the package included a little more information on taking proper measurements but that is what the internet is there for.
