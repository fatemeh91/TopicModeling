review/text: Here's my 2 cents (take it or leave it): I am looking for a good, quick shave in the morning provided by a reliable and low maintenance razor (call me crazy). I bought the Braun 8585 about 6 months ago and have little good to say. I understand the majority of reviews are positive and this is my personal experience. This shaver is extremely heavy - it is difficult to manipulate and use during shaving. This shaver is bulky and does not fit well on my sink counter (I have a double sink counter) and I especially have to manipulate the base unit and power cord constantly. This shaver also requires regular replacement of the cleaning cartridges and cutter and foil unit (mine lasted only 6 or 7 months and I do not have a heavy beard). I understand that companies make their money by selling consumers "solutions" (i.e. I'll give you the disposable razor or printer for free - you just have to buy replacement blades and ink cartridges forever) but the cost involved in replacement items for the 8585 is not negligible. In addition, to get even a mediocre shave with this razor, I have to pull and stretch skin on my face throughout the shave. For me, this razor is not what I am looking for in regards to this activity in my life. If the shave was amazing or even very good, I would probably indulge these inconveniences, but the shave is nothing to write home about. My old stand-by Norelco will make a return appearance this week.
