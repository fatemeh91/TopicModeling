review/text: I just got my first pair of glasses 2 months ago. Honestly I purchased this product just to qualify for free shipping on another. However, for few bucks I paid, it's made my life a whole lot easier. Simply put, keep it with you, and you have a simple way to keep your glasses pretty clean and clear. Not perfect, mind you, but a whole lot better than any material I generally have at hand. There are probably expensive cloths that work better, but as it's effective and cheaper than a latte, I'm very happy with this one. Highly recommended
