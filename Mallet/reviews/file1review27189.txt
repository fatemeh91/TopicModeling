review/text: I use this product to give that extra fuel to the muscle after workouts. The most important thing to remember is not to consume in over-dose quantity.For instance, I take less than-half the spoon powder in about 9 Oz of cold milk.Also, I always look for the freshness of the product. The I got here is good through Sep 2012. That's good enough!In short, good product, good packaging, good price and good for overall muscle building.
