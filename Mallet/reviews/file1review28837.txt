review/text: I am working on my second bag of this. I think it tastes great and its an excuse to drink chocolate milk 3 times a day. I use it because I started lifting weights several months ago and I want to make sure that I am taking in enough protein. Seems inexpensive to me as well. I will continue to buy this product...especially if the price goes down further. wink wink.
