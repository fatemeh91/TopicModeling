review/text: Taste- amazing compared to most on the market. Not for you if you like the super sweet saturated fake sugar proteins. High in BCAA's and glutamine for recovery. Best protein for the price I have tried, and I have tried almost every major brand. Only down side is cholesterol as with most whey proteins.
