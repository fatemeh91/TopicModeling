review/text: My roommate was raving about these tweezers he bought while vising Europe and so I snuck in his bathroom to try them and saw the little Henckel's logo on them and wasn't surprised. Not only do they make great knives, but these are the best tweezers I have EVER used!...and what makes them even better is that I can get them from Amazon! You can't go wrong with these. I HIGHLY recommend them.
