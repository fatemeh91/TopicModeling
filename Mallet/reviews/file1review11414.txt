review/text: I really love the design of this product. I have tried many different night guards and this is definitely my favorite as far as comfort. The problem I had was exorbitant cost and durability.I bought this in the first place because my dentist quoted me at $500 for an acrylic night guard. Presumably, the Sleep Right would be a better option, but for $40 each, they don't last long. I found that I ground through mine in about 30 days. I would actually give Sleep Right a glowing review if they let you buy the replacement grind pads for a reasonable price or if they gave you a few extra grind pads per pack...but since you have to buy the entire set with the main piece that holds the pads, carrying case, and packaging, this turns into a $500/year investment that is no longer worth it. Like I said, great design, but they are pricing themselves right past the more durable versions you can get specially fitted at the dentist.
