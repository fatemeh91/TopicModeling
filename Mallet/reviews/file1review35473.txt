review/text: I had two different plumbers/dishwasher repair men mention to me that Dishwasher Magic is a must to take care of any hard water stains. To be honest, we have some hard water, but nothing too crazy, so I held off buying this figuring it wasn't really needed. However, once we used this our dishwasher the end result was that our Dishwasher was sparkling!I wish it was about half the price, but then again you only need to use it every so often in your Dishwasher.
