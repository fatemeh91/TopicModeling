review/text: I've been using this little brush for about a year and it's been great. I'm a fan of these small-sized palm brushes, which are easier to control with soapy hands than their long-handled cousins.The replaceable brush head is nice since I can easily remove it and run it through the dishwasher when I feel it needs a thorough sanitization. I have not had to buy a new brush head even after a year of daily use. And the brush has never accidentally fallen off during use as some other reviewers have reported.I only have 2 minor complaints:1. The black, screw-on cap is sometimes difficult to remove. I may have accidentally overtightened it when I put it on the last time or maybe it got tighter while I was scrubbing dishes. Luckily the black cap is rubberized and so drying it and my hands provides a good enough grip to unscrew it.2. Soap is not always dispensed when the button is pushed. I would estimate this happens 1 out of 10 button pushes.The soap dispensing function works well for the most part. Dish soap will frequently get trapped in the bristles--especially when the brush is not held perfectly vertical. This alone would not be a problem (since soap in the bristles works fine) but when combined with complaint #2 above I found that I would constantly have to flip the brush upside down to see if soap was dispensed. To alleviate this problem I like to mix dish soap and water in approximately a 1:1 ratio in the brush so that the soap is less viscous and will shoot out of the brush easier and not get caught in the bristles. If I don't see soap shoot out when I push the button, I just push it again.Soap has never leaked from the brush when not in use.
