review/text: I'm surprised by the high ratings for this product. My wife and I have been very disappointed with it. The main problem is that the splash guard does not extend down far enough. Every time our little boy uses this seat, the bottom of it is soaked, the actual toilet seat is soaked, the underside of the toilet seat is soaked, and the rim of the toilet is soaked. And no, the problem is not our toilet or our existing toilet seat, because the same thing happens on any toilet we use this on. Very poor design--I do not recommend at all if you have a son. Perhaps if we had a daughter, I would be giving it a higher rating.
