review/text: This is probably the best Oxo product I've purchased! It is supremely flexible and adaptable, and I've used it to clean all sorts of things around the kitchen and in fact the whole house.AND, when you're done? It cleans itself in the dishwasher! How cool is that?!You'll love having this thing in the kitchen -- perfect for cleaning out water bottles, condiment bottles, whatever you have!Recommended without reservation! :)
