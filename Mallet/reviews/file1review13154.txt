review/text: We used this on our son's (4 year-old) bed. The few accidents he had this product proved to not work (naturally he has a brand new mattress). Perhaps this is waterproof for a drop of water.....It is nice and soft but if it cannot handle an accident what is the point. Not a good product for us and I cannot recommend this.
