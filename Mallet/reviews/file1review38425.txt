review/text: Most of these reviews are by people who've just opened the box. Mine is different. I've been using this exact product for 8 years.I purchased this model because razors were causing:1. Ingrown hair bumps; particularly in my bikini region, but other places I shaved, as well2. My leg and underarm hair to grow in so thick, that even right after shaving, I still had small visible hairs (under the skin). Like a 5 o'clock shadow. Sexy on a guy. NOT sexy on a girl.I found it stung a little when I tried to use it, out of the box. So I shaved first, then used it every day for about a month. Since the hair was so short, it felt more strange than painful. After that, I could go a few days, and then use it without any pain.It took a few months for the product to make a difference with the thickness of my hair; I had been shaving daily for at least 5 years, so I'd done plenty of damage. But it DID change. Problem number 2 cleared up, first. I still fought problem 1 for a couple years more; but it was getting better. I recommend Tweezerman - Ingrown Hair Splintertweeze, for those. Problem number 1 has finally disappeared; the hair in the regions I epilate has become light and thin, like peach fuzz, rather than black and thick.I find the unit lasts about 3 years, before you need to replace the blades. So you save lots of money over using razors and cream. The power supply will go first. I just purchase one separately for about $10 when that happens, rather than replacing the whole unit. Make sure to match the power units when purchasing; it uses a rare amperage.Conclusion:1. You look and feel sexier2. You spend less time achieving #13. You save money4. You read this far; so I'll reward you with what some may consider TMI: I use this product to keep the entire area between my legs hair-free and smooth. Just be careful and pay close attention when working in that area. Don't try this half-asleep, people.
