review/text: I have caramel colored skin and have a lot of scars from KP (keratosis pilaris) aka chicken skin. I bought this after seeing the commercial and wanted to give it a try. Turns out, it does work! I've been using it for 3 weeks now. I'll say this:1. For the darker, newer scars, they've either lightened greatly, or are gone.2. For the darker, older scars, the've lightened very well, and MUCH faster than usual.3. for the lighter, newer scars, they were gone first, in about a week in a half.4. For the lighter, older scars, those are taking the most time, but I'm not surprised.Here's some things you'll need to know. For one, you'll need to get a buff brush, loofah, anything like that with a mix or if you have sensitive skin, exfoliating body wash. Why? Those stuff gets the skin dirty fast! I wash every day, but I started getting black heads like crazy because of something this stuff does to the pores. So there's two things to this. Besides needing it to combat the black heads, the more dead skin cells you wash off the fast it works. To also combat the black heads get some benzoyl peroxide. I'm using 10% as is for the KP, and the higher the level, the faster the black head go away.Also, my skin glows (hate to use that word, but its the best word to use) and is much softer.The smell isn't that bad either, goes away after bout 20 mins, but even when smelling it its ok.No product out there gets immediate results, no matter how much we wish it, but this does work really well without any peeling or redness.I also wanted to say, I don't jus use it one my face, but on my arms, chect and legs and it works on all areas, just a little slower though.
