review/text: All floss is pretty much the same. Insert the floss between your teeth, use up and down strokes against each side of the tooth, and floss each and every day. Hmm. Each and every day? Until I had a near-root canal at the dentist, I was lax in my flossing for a simple reason: the tips of my fingers hurt and were turning purple from the floss tourniquet around my fingers. I haven't tried the other Glide flosses, but Glide Deep Clean doesn't cause this discomfort, so I'm using it daily. Even though it's one of the more expensive flosses at the store, it's certainly cheaper than a second trip to the dentist.EDIT: My dental hygenist recommends Reach over Glide. Reducing my rating to two stars.
