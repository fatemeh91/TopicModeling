review/text: Ive been using these attachments for years but this is the last one I'm going to buy. They never last more than 2 months but they are very easy to find and very cheap that's why I kept buying them. Thank goodness for the magnetic guards I found out about from another barber. They are expensive for guards but they work great and are very durable. So long speed o guides lol....
