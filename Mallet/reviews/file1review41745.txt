review/text: We purchased this after I dropped and cracked my previous Oral-B powered toothbrush that I'd had for 5 years.A must-have for us was the covered toothbrush holder. It has vents in the back to allow the heads to dry and prevent them from growing mold.I really like having the 3 settings on the brush since my teeth and gums are more sensitive than my husband's.The rechargeable battery really does last over two weeks on a single charge, even with two people using it!
