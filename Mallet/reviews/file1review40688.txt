review/text: I just love, love, love this product! I tried this shampoo on my daughter's hair because she was getting into the pool a lot this summer and I was concerned about the damage from the chlorine. Let me tell you this shampoo and the leave in conditioner that goes with it just leave her hair so soft and silky, I LOVE IT. And the smell is just wonderful, and it last a long time. It's a good buy, definately.
