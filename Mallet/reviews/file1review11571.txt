review/text: I recently purchased these batteries at a local store for my Microsoft Entertainment 8000 keyboard and mouse. The original Energizer batteries that came with the keyboard needed to be charged everyday! With the new batteries it's been over 3 weeks now on a single charge! These batteries are worth every penny. Microsoft should seriously consider including these batteries with their hardware. 5 stars!
