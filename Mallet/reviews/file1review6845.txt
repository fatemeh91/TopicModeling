review/text: While my primary shooting is done on digital (wedding photography), I do sometimes shoot hybrid (digital and film) not to mention my personal work which is mostly black and white 35mm. After I got back in the darkroom, I wanted to buy a loupe to view details quickly before deciding which negatives I wanted to scan (a lengthy process at high quality).PROS- Comfortable to use- Well made- Allows plenty of light inCONS- Not adjustable- Doesn't work well without a lightboxThe price is definitely right, and coupled with a light box this is a great little tool to have! I was pleasantly surprised at how big this thing is, making it comfortable to use over the viewing of several rolls. If you don't have a lightbox, you will need an exceptionally well-lit area. I would highly suggest picking up a smaller, cheaper lightbox such as the reasonably bright and well-madeArtograph 8x11 Light Box- there are better and more expensive boxes, but unless you're making money from film you probably won't need one.OVERALLRecommended, with some reservations.
