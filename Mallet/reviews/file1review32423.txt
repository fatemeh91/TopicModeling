review/text: This wrist brace was too stiff. I bought it to help relieve some pain while doing data entry but I couldn't move my wrist in it. I tried to loosen it up and even remove the metal brackets inside (which are removable), but it didn't help. Very uncomfortable.I tried to return this item, or at least exchange it for just a plain "wrist band" but they told me since I'd opened it, it was non returnable. Their customer service wouldn't even work with me to resolve the problem.Needless to say, I am stuck with the item which I will never use and out some money.If I had gone up to the local store to buy this item, I would have been able to return/exchange it. I won't be buying from this company again :)I give this company 0 stars, the product 1 star (for those who don't need to move their wrist).
