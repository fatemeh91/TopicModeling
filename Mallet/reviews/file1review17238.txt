review/text: I owned the initial version of this trimmer and absolutely LOVED it. The charge lasted forever and it's just a solid little trimmer that feels comfortable, gives you good, clean and even length settings and is very easy to clean. However, I dropped it once and the mechanism that snapped the top part on broke. My fault, so I was fine, but it was just too loose to be effective anymore. When they went on sale for $9.99 last year around this time, I was so excited ordered 5 of them, 2 for me and 3 as gifts. When I received them, I noticed they were a different color and in different boxing, but didn't think much of it since the design looked identical. Well, I have been using it over the last month after growing my beard back, and I am sorry to say that the newer version's battery is terrible. As other reviewers have said, it IS far worse than other trimmer battery lives, and the fact that you can't use it plugged in is a huge design flaw. Here's the problem: you start trimming your beard and the charge seems strong, but then in the middle it just poops out on you. Well, would be great if you could just plug in and finish the job, but no...you basically have to walk around with a half trimmed beard and hope the stupid thing charges fast. Don't get me wrong, the thing works great when it's fully charged...but if it doesn't hold a charge, that's a huge problem, because anyone who has a beard knows you aren't going to trim the thing every day. AND the fact that the initial version's battery held a charge forever tells me they cheaped out on the battery of the newer version, which completely destroys the integrity of what was a fantastic product. My old broken one still holds a charge forever, so I know this to be true. It's just a shame...
