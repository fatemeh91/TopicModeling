review/text: Despite my bottle saying it doesn't expire until 2014, the moment I opened the lid and safety seal I was assaulted by a horrific smell. I assume the oil must be rancid because it's almost an indescribable smell... sort of yeast-like, definitely nothing coconut-like at all. I usually like NOW's products and they seem to have good quality control, but maybe something went wrong with the coconut oil capsules...
