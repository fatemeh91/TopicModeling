review/text: First, this is a juice concentrate and you should add water. Do not try to drink this juice concentrate without adding water.The juice has a strong citric (but not citric aroma) taste. The taste isn't bitter and somewhat sweet.The evidence of benefits of pomegranate seems to be getting more numerous and stronger every year. The ladies swear by its complexion-enriching (produces more collagen) benefits. There is also indirect evidence that ingredients in pomegranate promotes better aging, reduces the likelihood of obesity, and is generally protective of organs such as the heart.You will need to use more than a spoonful if you want to drink this as a "juice".Pros:1)Juice concentrate so it is perfect for purchasing and shipping online.2)Doesn't require refrigeration. It requires refrigeration after opening (juice can stay fresh for prolonged period without it).3)Tastes very decent (but not terrific).Cons:1)Expensive but pomegranate is an expensive fruit.
