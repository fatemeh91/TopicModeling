review/text: This DGL is as far from chewable as a pill comes. This tablet sits on my tongue like a dirty rock. I bought a twistable pill crusher to try to pulverize it before chewing it. Fifteen minutes of "crushing" later more than half of it is still solid. This is the only vegan DGL chewable I could find. The flavor is not too bad. It tastes like it was licorice at one time but with a sandy feel. I've tried sucking on it also, after about fifteen minutes I end up just swallowing it. The reason I am still using it is because I am having chemo therapy treatments right now and my ND recommend the chewable to help with oral erosion. So, I'm stuck with it. If you don't need chewable vegan DGL, then do yourself a favor and try something else.
