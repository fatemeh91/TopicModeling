review/text: Started taking this after about a month and a half of working out following a two year hiatis from any sort of exercise. While I should let myself suffer for being so lazy for those two years, I purchased Osteo Bi-Flex to help alleviate; shoulder, elbow, and knee discomfort. And alleviate my discomfort it certainly has. I take two pills (one at breakfast and one at dinner) daily and I feel great. I currently experience no pain in any of my joints and have been working out 4-5 times a week pretty rigorously(rigorously for an out of shape 30 something).
