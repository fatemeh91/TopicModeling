review/text: About what I expected. It does dig into your underarms a little bit, but it does make a difference, if you adjust it to the right size. Don't wear it ALL day when you first get it - ease into it, or you'll be just as uncomfortable as you were before. I'd recommend it if you need something to get you started on working on your posture.
