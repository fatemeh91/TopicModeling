review/text: This product was very disappointing. Even though I showered right before using Nair 3 in 1 to soften the hair, it still worked poorly. My legs weren't as smooth as with shaving, and they became irritated. I used the product three times in one week and the only difference between that and shaving is that the Nair moisturized my legs. That one benefit is not worth me sitting for 10-15 minutes to wait for the product to work. I feel the package needs to be clearer, as well. I had to read the tiny print of the ""warning"" to learn where on my body I could and couldn't use it. I won't be purchasing this product for myself, and certainly won't recommend it to anyone. Just keep your razor.
