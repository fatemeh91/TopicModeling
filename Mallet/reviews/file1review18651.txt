review/text: I really was hoping this would work. Tried it last night. I was put off by the strong taste of not just alcohol, but whatever is in it. I have taken alcohol based homeopathics before (by bioAllers), but nothing that has tasted this bad. I followed the directions exactly, taking 30 drops an hour before bed and another 30 at bedtime. I lay there wide awake for over an hour. More wide awake than usual! I finally had to take a sleeping pill. No go for me anyway.
