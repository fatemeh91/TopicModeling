review/text: I have done quite a bit of research and this is the cheapest, best tasting, fast acting whey on the market that I can find. It mixes easily and one of the best things I like about it is that it doesn't have any chemical sweeteners, and yet is sweet enough without. This is low cal, low/no fat, and very low (almost no) carb- almost pure protein- great for pre and post workout- and I take it with me everywhere I go on trips. I highly recommend this product.
