review/text: Three months ago, I bought 48 Gillette Fusion Power refills (quite an investment), and placed them on my bathroom drawer, and to my surprise, last week I went to replace a cartridge, and found that ALL, literally all, were completely rusted !It's a a shock, and all Mach 3 I had there for longer than that were just like new.How can P&G; can explain that??
