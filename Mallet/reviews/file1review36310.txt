review/text: I recently broke my Tibia, dislocated my ankle, and tore some ligaments. After surgery and some time in a walking boot, my physical therapist recommended this brace to me.It's been three days and I have to say this thing is AWESOME. It gives me total support, and is as good if not better than an ankle taping - as i can take it off, adjust it, and reuse it.Great work, great product Swede-O.
