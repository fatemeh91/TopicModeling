review/text: Well, I've gotta hand it to the Gillette people...They've come up with an excellent product...One that you will want to use again and again...Of course, they charge an absolute premium for these blades, because they know that people will come back to them. While the blades are indeed excellent, I've found recently that the real key to a good shave is using a premium shave cream...Not the stuff you normally find on grocery shelves, but something natural from a company such as Arbonne. At any rate, the blades work as well as advertised, although in my experience they only last about 4-5 good shaves before replacement is needed. Here's a money-saving tip for you....You DO NOT need to use "power" replacement blades on a Fusion "power" razor...The Fusion non-power blades fit the "power" razor, but cost a chunk of change less and work exactly the same.
