review/text: After so many years of using and abusing my body (I am close to 60) exercising and running and just being active, my joints started screaming in pain. My knee got so bad I was afraid to put weight on it and would walk around with a soft brace. Started taking this stuff and was just amazed at the fast results. Amazing! I am literally pain free and can do step classes, yoga, jog...I mean, this has given me back my life. I ALWAYS order these now, and get nervous if I get low. They are expensive, but so worth the price.
