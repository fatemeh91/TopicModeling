review/text: My last saver the Panasonic ES8152NC met with my plaster wall in a fit of anger. So as a total perfectionist I tried this one because it came with a "Brawn" money back grantee for the fist 30 days. I have found this one is the ticket, it gets no better then this, it shaves me closer then a razor, it is simply perfect. The major improvement on this model is the head design, that alone, is possibly why it is perfect. To add to this perfection scenario it is not made in China or any Asian sweet shop, but in Germany, or at least mine was.
