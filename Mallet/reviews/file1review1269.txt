review/text: These have worked well for me each and every time and it doesn't hurt.My brows now are even and the right amount of hair is removed, this hasn't always been the case at a salon and these are way cheaper!I'll never overpay again, especially when I get a great result at home, and no waiting around for the lady to finish with someone's feet.
