review/text: I purchased this for my husband at Christmas. He was using his regular shaver to trim his beard. He would have never purchased this trimmer for himself and would have been content to "make due" with his shaver. I like his beard and was afraid he'd cut off more beard than he'd like with the old shaver. This trimmer has an adjustable trimmer so that his beard length will be proportional. He does like this trimmer and it has made trimming a lot easier for him.
