review/text: Just what we wanted and needed. Our scale arrived in very protective packaging. It was easy to assemble, but took a phillips-head screwdriver in addition to the tool included (no big deal, just an extra trip to the garage). The scale is easy to use and, with a morning trip to the doctor's office including the same weight measurement on their scale as this new home scale, very accurate. A good purchase and great value.
