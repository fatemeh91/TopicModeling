review/text: I just received this item today, so I can't speak for its long-term efficacy. I did want to pop in to say that this is d-Alpha vitamin e (natural) as opposed to dl-Alpha (synthetic). The only other ingredient is extra virgin olive oil. I uploaded a couple of photos of the label. The bottle came sealed with an expiration date of 05/16. This was sold and fulfilled by Amazon.I purchased this for use on my skin, but I tasted it. It definitely tastes like a vegetable/plant derived oil, and taste of the olive oil is distinct as well. None of that odiferous, furniture polish scented, lemon oil wannabe crap. I tested it on the inside of my arm, and after it absorbed I feel minimal to no oily residue -- very nice.Due to its obvious freshness, high potency, natural origins, and sealed bottle with a lengthy time until expiration, I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and rate it 4 stars. If it doesn't break me out I'll come back and give it 5.Enjoy! :-)
