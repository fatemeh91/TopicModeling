review/text: I've been trying to gain weight forever! (I'm 5-11, 155) I've been taking this for 2 weeks, 2 scoops and 12 oz of skim milk before bed. The next 2 weeks I'm going to drink 2 a day. One at work, and one at night. I'm trying to maintain a good 175 pounds. I ride a bike daily about 15 miles and do pushups. I'm not really a gym rat, weightlifter guy. Just trying to fill out my t-shirt a little.As for the taste, it's very good. I actually don't like milk, but the double vanilla tastes awesome. Haven't tried any other flavor. definately reccommend this to anyone out there based on taste alone, it doesn't give me gas or a bloated feeling.
