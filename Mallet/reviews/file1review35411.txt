review/text: Our Kenmore Ultra Wash dishwasher (bought in Nov. 2005) had stopped cleaning dishes in the upper rack and even the dishes in the lower rack were clean looking, but felt filmy and gritty...like undissolved soap or? Tried Dishwasher Magic and after just one bottle's use, dishes in both racks came out clean as a whistle...machine is cleaning like it used to.Wonderful to not have had to call a repairman and pay hundred(s?)for an easy (as it turned out)fix.Great product...will use monthly from now on!
