review/text: The quality is very nice and it has had hard use over the couple of years I've had it. It washes easily and drys effectively so that it could be ready for use the same day but I would advise having at least four of these items if you are caring for an incontinent and demented adult. It covers a sufficient area of the twin bed or hospital bed so that only one is necessary.
