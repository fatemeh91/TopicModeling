review/text: Nine years ago when I had my second child I had the type that went over and under my belly...which was great but of course I've since given it away. With this child, I decided to buy this adjustable prenatal cradle and it was okay...yes, it supported the weight of my belly but didn't give me enough back support that I required and to add to that it wasn't really user-friendly (so to speak), meaning it only had 3 choices to choose from to adjust for size...once you've outgrown the last eye & hook because you estimate the size you'll get but don't expect to exceed that size, it's useless....the previous one I had (9 yrs ago) was velcro style which held up wonderfully and I wish I would've stuck with that same style which would've saved me some money.
