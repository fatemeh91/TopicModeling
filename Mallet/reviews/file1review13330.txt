review/text: These are wonderful for protecting my aging dog's orthopedic dogbed. It is so much easier to wash the protector (and replace it immediately with a clean one) than it is to remove and wash the entire bedcover. He likes to paw his bed before he lays down, so I secure the sheet protector with the "new and improved sheet suspenders" that run under the bed and secure the protector at the corners, keeping it in place. He took to the quilted-like cover of the protector right away, and I like that he always has a clean, dry bed. I'm so grateful I found this product.
