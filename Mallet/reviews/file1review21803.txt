review/text: I have been usingEyesight Rx - An All Natural Herbal Eye Supplement for Eyesight Improvement and Vision Support and w/ Lutein, Zeaxanthin, Eyebright, Bilberry, Mucuna, and Beta Cerotene - 30 Vitamin Tablets - Developed by Dr. Ray Sahelian, M.D.for several weeks now and have definitely noticed an improvement in my vision. My ability to read small print is coming back as is my distance vision. I am so happy that I discovered this formula and will continue to use it. It will be interesting to see how much further my vision improves. The only negative thing I have to say about it is that the taste of the pill when you crush it between your front teeth is a little bitter, but the pill is so small that it is gone quickly and I wash it away with my morning almond milk.
