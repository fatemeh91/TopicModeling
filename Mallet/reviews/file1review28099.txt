review/text: ON Gold standard whey is at the top of my list. I try others and even different lines of ON but keep coming back for the results, flavor variety, and ease of mix. This time I ventured out and tried the Caramel Toffee Fudge even with very little reviews. As a hint. It is very hard to find reviews for certain flavors but I realized that on the right side of the reviews section there is a search bar for just reviews of the product. Type in the flavor and it will bring up all the reviews with that listed in them. I was very frustrated by reading all the chocolate reviews and not finding the ones I wanted and this helped me decide the ones that got good review. Flavor was pretty good and almost reminiscent of a Wearther's candy piece. My wife used this with some greek yogurt and said it was delicious. If your looking for variety and like the general ingredients give this a go.
