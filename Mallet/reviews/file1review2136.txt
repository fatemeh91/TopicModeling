review/text: Dip it in powder form is the absolute best for removing coffee and tea stains from the inside of your thermos bottle. I highly recommed that the manufacturer promote this concept because it works. I am certain that for other stains it will work as well and it is safe to use your thermos after use. What more can one ask for.
