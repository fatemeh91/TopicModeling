review/text: I was really surprised to read the other reviews as I have had NO problems with this tub. In fact, I liked it so much with my first (who is now 5) that I bought another one for my newest addition (now 5 months old). It is exactly what I needed..something easy to put away, portable and comfortable for my baby to bathe in.While, it is true that when you drain it, all of the water does not go out, it is also VERY easy to simply tilt the tub with one hand and dump the remaining water out.I think that this is the perfect tub to bathe your baby in because it does exactly what you need it to, no more and no less.Don't waste your money on the more expensive tubs as it is unlikely that you will really use the added "perks" that they include. Instead, buy this tub for $10 and you won't be sorry!
