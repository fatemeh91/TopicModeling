review/text: I have struggled with dry and cracked skin on my feet most of my life and have tried many creams, ointments and home made remedies with no lasting improvement. With the Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Foot cream I can say I no longer have a problem. I use it every morning and also before I go to bed. Since I started using the product the callus on my heels has gone, no more cracked, bleeding, painful openings on my feet! My local drug store stopped carrying it last year, so finding it online was great! I bought several tubes. It's the BEST! Thank you
