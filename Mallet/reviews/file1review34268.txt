review/text: This is definitely cooling and refreshing - there's no denying that. However, &#34;Calmoseptine&#34; feels about exactly the same and comes in a MUCH, MUCH larger container, so if you're needing to use this frequently, you might get a little more mileage out of Calmoseptine. It's kinda nice that Calmoseptine has an English label so you know what your putting on your booty too... :)
