review/text: I'm not sure if I would purchase the Balance Bars again or not. They were great for a quick snack or even for breakfast, but I didn't seem to notice an extra boost of energy like I thought I might get based on the product's description. They did seem to fill me up for awhile. Mostly, I can't decide whether I like the taste. To each his own!!
