review/text: I took the trimmer out and pop a new battery in and it didn't even start. I heard there might be some quality issue with this product but this is ridicules. I didn't even had a chance to use it.** Update **Amazon immediately sent a replacement and I received it in 4 days. The trimmer seems to pull the hairs out of the nose in order to cut them. This is the first time I'm afraid of a nose trimmer. I will recommend people to use with care.
