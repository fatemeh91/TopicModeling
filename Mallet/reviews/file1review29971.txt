review/text: I've tried several different amino acids supplements and have decided this is my favorite. For the price you get 360 caps which last well over a month for me. I liked Amino Energy by ON but it's just too expensive to justify. I take 2 each morning and 4 after workouts to supplement my protein shake. Powders aren't bad either but this is grabbing these caps are too convenient.
