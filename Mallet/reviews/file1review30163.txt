review/text: For some reason, it seems difficult to find copper (or steel) scouring pads in stores anymore. That's why it's nice to be able to order them online.They are scouring pads, and they do the job as advertised. They are good for really caked-on dish messes, gum-on-tile, and other similar jobs.
