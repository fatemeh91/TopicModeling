review/text: This is a great kitchen tool! I always have mine handy.Notes: 1.) The bristles are very sturdy. In spite of all of my hard scrubbing, they have never bent or frayed. 2.) It's shape allows you to get a good grip *and* still be able to mauver around pots and pans. 3.) There is ample space to hold liquid soap. You'll only have to refill it every couple of weeks.
