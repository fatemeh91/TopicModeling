review/text: Item arrived promptly. Contained odd warning about not using with children, but others have commented on that.Physically it appeared to match product description.The first time I used it, I was pleased to see that although it had gotten wet overnight, it felt dry to the touch on top. So my child was clean and comfortable.Changing the bed later I discovered WHY it was clean and comfortable on top - it leaked through completely and the bedding underneath was soaked through.I do not recommend this product if you are trying to prevent moisture from reaching the bedding or the mattress. It did keep my child dry, but other options do both.
