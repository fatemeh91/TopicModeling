review/text: I oredered this product lat December after Christmas. I am 39 years old and my husband and I are hoping to have a child. Because of my age, I decided to give nature a little help without the use ofmedications. I became pregnant after 2 1/2 months of use. Unfortunately, I miscarried at 11 weeks. Be sure to read all of the product information so that you are not disillusioned. My husband and I are not discouraged and elieve that this product helped use concieve naturally.
