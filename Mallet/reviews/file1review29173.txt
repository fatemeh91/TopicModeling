review/text: Seldom do you encounter a product that so thoroughly exceeds your expectations and costs so little. This is an amazing little engineering marvel. And what a joy this power toothbrush is to use! Leaves your teeth feeling slippery and nice and is slim and maneuverable enough to get far back to the molars. Easy to use, doesn't spatter, and doesn't nanny you to death with beeps and stops. If you use NiMH rechargeable batteries, you can also be green and life-on-earth friendly.
