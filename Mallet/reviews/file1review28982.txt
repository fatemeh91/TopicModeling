review/text: i have had the braun free control (series 1) for about a year now, and was excited to see this cruzer as an "upgrade". on www.braun.com/cruzer it clearly shows the cruzer to feature the smart foil design, which was a big reason why i plan to buy this. does it really have the smart foil design for clean shaving? or is it the same...what ive seen here on amazon leads me to believe it may be the same as opposed to what ive seen on the braun site. thanks
