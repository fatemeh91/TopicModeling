review/text: I cannot believe this product ever made it to the market! The head of the mop swivels off constantly, causing you to push down hard with the handle to keep it on. It is impossible to wring out the sponge head, since about two inches of the foam never get wrung out, causing water to drip everywhere. All of this makes for a very sore back. You're better off cleaning the floor by hand! I've never been so quick to throw out a new product in my life! What a waste of time and muscle...ouch!
