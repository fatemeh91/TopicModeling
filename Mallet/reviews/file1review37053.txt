review/text: I bought this stuff hoping that it would be just as good as what I used to use. For a short time Degree made a spray anti-perspirant that was called Powerc (same can, different name). I have been unable to find this anymore in a spray can, so I bought this Sport brand instead. I HATE this stuff. This stuff has stained my shirts, and has done nothing for perspiration. I don't know how something can be labeled anti-perspirant when it does nothing to that effect. I am not going to use this stuff anymore, if I can not find the Power spray I will most likely give up all together on Degree!
