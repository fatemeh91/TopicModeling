review/text: I like how light the Freedom Dorsal night splint feels when sleeping in it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because it seems a little too big and can come off during the night. I wear a size 9 women's shoe. The splint I bought was size Large. This splint really helps relieve a lot of heal pain when I first stand up in the morning after wearing it the night before. The price and comfort makes this a good splint.
