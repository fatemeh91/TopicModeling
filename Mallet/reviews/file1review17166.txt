review/text: I bought this because my father had one for a while and said it worked well. Guess what - it does. I wanted something rechargeable, simple, that could give me a 'stubble' look. The product works great - just set it to the lowest setting and voila, take off the plastic head cover for an even closer detailing. The battery life is fantastic - charged it when I got it, have been using it maybe twice a week for a month now? Maybe more? Still haven't had to recharge it. Cleaning is easy - shake it, pop open the top, and use the supplied brush to empty any hair.One design flaw - when you flip open the top to clean it, the top is only attached by a small plastic hinge. I have been careful and haven't had any problems, but I can see that a bit too much force will snap it off. Be careful and you will be fine, but don't let your kids play with it.In summary: very good lightweigt rechargeable trimmer. Don't bring it anywhere near water, but still cleanable. I even use it on other...areas of my body with great results.
