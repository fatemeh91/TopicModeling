review/text: I love this for breakfast even when I'm not dieting and I've found the optimum way to prepare it (for myself, anyway) and thought I'd pass it along: you put skim milk in a shaker (use one with measuring marks on it to get the 8 oz. of milk lined up right), add the scoop of S-F, then a couple of ice cubes. Shake it like you're making a martini, for a couple of minutes, then pop it into your freezer for about 15 minutes and then use a straw, for that real milkshake feeling! Trust me, it's worth the wait. It comes out thicker and colder and more satisfying than a blender can ever make it. You can adjust the freeze time to your preference or to your particular freezer. Awesomely delicious.
