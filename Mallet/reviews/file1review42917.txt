review/text: If you have been overwhelmed by chemicals while cleaning, then you will truly appreciate the natural scent of lavender in this scrub. This can be used in the kitchen or bathroom and it actually does contain real essential oils of lavender and orange.Unlike more synthetic cleaners, using this product can also have a therapeutic effect.Ingredients: Calcium Carbonate, Oxygen Bleach (natural cleaning activator), Plant-Derived Surfactants, Fragrance, and Essential Oils of Lavender and Orange. You may find yourself using less of this product than you would of a less natural product.The powder lasts a long time and you only need a little to clean an entire sink or bathtub. Unlike other powders that seem to dissolve more quickly, this one really cleans and scrubs before it dissolves, although it seems safe for most surfaces. You may also find the "gardenia" scrub to be equally entertaining.I love the scents of these products and it makes me want to clean. I no longer dread cleaning showers and even look forward to washing the kitchen sink.~The Rebecca Review
