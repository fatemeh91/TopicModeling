review/text: I bought this pad for my 4 1/2 year old's bed as she is still working on staying dry through the night. Changing sheets a few times a week was getting rough and so I opted to try a sheet protector.I failed to notice that this one was so small. It would fit a twin bed, but only covers about 2/3 the width of her full sized bed. The pad has nothing to help it stay in place at all, so it bunches up.It's difficult to imagine it being comfortable even for an adult who might stay a bit more still during sleep.I liked the idea of this but found it disappointing once put to use.
