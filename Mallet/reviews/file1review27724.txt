review/text: Well, I bought this because I kept hearing about how it's the best for the money. While I didn't think it was completely horrible, it just wasn't what I expected. The stuff mixes great, but tastes pretty rough, and that's coming from a guy who can drink body fortress chocolate whey all day long.I give this product 3 stars because it mixes better than alot of proteins I've tried and hey maybe you'll like it. Me, I'll stick with my Myofusion. Stuff can't be beat.
