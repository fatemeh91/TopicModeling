review/text: These batteries looked like exact replacements for my digital camera. The original batteries worked great!!! These will not hold a charge evensitting on the shelf. I charged all 8 batteries before a family event, and took several pictures. A week later, we had more family over and took a few pictures. Then, the next day, the batteries were dead. I replaced them with another set (recently charged), and was able to take TWO pictures before they were dead. I put in a third set (recently charged),and they were dead immediately :-(
