review/text: This is okay, but has artificial colors, sugar alcohols, and other ingredients that aren't exactly natural or as healthy as you might want.I have found another product that helps diabetics and others lose weight with only natural ingredients and high fiber and protein and a unique ingredient to help preserve muscle and metabolism - and end the yo-yo diet cycle safely. It is an "Amazing Inch Loss Plan . com" not just a diet or weight loss plan. It has an Ultra Low Glycemic Index of under 25. (Low is under 55.) It focuses on inches because it preserves muscle and muscle weighs more than fat. In fact, 5 pounds of fat is 3 TIMES LARGER than 5 pounds of muscle. So when you lose fat, you lose more inches than weight. It truly is amazing!Plus this is just a shake without all the other components and support you need to lose weight permanently and adopt a healthy lifestyle.
