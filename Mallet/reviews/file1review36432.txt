review/text: When I was diagnosed with the start of AMD, my doctor told me to take these vitamins. I don't know how much of my stabilization/improvement relates to the vitamins, but I give them at least some of the credit. However, these are NOT to be taken if you haven't been diagnosed - they are a heavy dose with other side effects.
