review/text: I was looking for a floor sweeper that didn't need batteries to replace my Quickshine sweeper whose batteries seemed to die every year. Unfortunately this wasn't it. The biggest issue I had with it was the fact there is only one brush in the center which makes it impossible to pick up crumbs in a corner. My other concern (which may be not be the case) was the metal plate underneath. It sounded like it was scraping tile floor which would be very bad on wood floors. The great things about this sweeper are the price, solid construction, easy to put together and it seemed to work very well on carpet. Like I said, I tried to like it, but ended up going back to the Quickshine electric sweeper.
