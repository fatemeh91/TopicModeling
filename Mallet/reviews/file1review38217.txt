review/text: The rating is partially for my inattention to detail when ordering this product. I thought that I was ordering the "Whole Husk" version of this psyllium, but ordered the "Powder" instead. We love the whole husk for our protein drink in the morning, which keeps us right and regular. The powder does not provide a very good consistency compared to the whole husk. The powder makes it get too thick and barely drinkable. I would recommend to anyone to try the whole husk as opposed to this powder stuff.
