review/text: I have these in the car, house, wherever i go! Great for mid day floss or if you hate flossing. These are a godsend for me because my teeth are so tight together, flossing is miserable. Maybe I'm being dumb, but these are a great substitute, and much better than not flossing...BY FAR. Always help get stuff out... so I know my teeth are much better off. LOVE THEM!!!!!
