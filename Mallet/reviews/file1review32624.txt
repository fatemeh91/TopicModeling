review/text: These bars are by far the best meal replacement bar on the market. They are made of all natural ingredients that you can taste in every bite. You can see what is in the bar by looking at it, no guessing involved. Whole nuts, cranberries, grains, delicious! I've tried just about every protein bar and meal replacement bar I could find and I am a Pro Bar Believer!I'm traveling for a week to Toronto in a month and will be bringing these along for quick bites in between customers.
