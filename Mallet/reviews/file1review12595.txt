review/text: This product, if used as instructed, works well. It worked for me, just as the manufacturer stated it would. I took it more for removing the toxins that I believe may have accumulated in my colon over the years and for occasional irregularities. I normally do not have a constipation problem since I have followed a mostly vegetarian diet for the past seven years. I am pleased to say that I did a lot of research on other colon cleansers before I selected this one, and I have no regrets. Most of the others contained Psyllium, an ingredient that gave me bloating and constipation in the past, so I stayed clear of those. Two weeks earlier, I had tried another colon cleanser that has a three step program, I had to return it to the store three days after using it because step one made my head feel as heavy as a bowling ball and made me drowsy. Oxy-powder did not give me bloating or headaches or any more gas than I would usually pass during a day, and yes, I did have loose stool, but it was not the type(like diarrahea from botulism) that caused me any concern. Anyway, I would prefer loose stool over the other kind. I do feel as if my body is cleaner and I have a little more energy in the mornings. I also did not have the need to be near a restroom at all times, and I did have as many as five bowel movements per day. I started out by taking 2 capsules the first night just to see how it works for me, then I increased it to 4 capsules each night. I also drank a lot of water(about 100 ounces per day) which I think is very important for the best results. I have a lot more of the product and I will do a cleansing every two or three months until all of it is used up. That's where value comes in, it costs a lot less than the Psyllium ones, and you can stretch the usage based on your needs. I am so pleased with this product, I have recommended it to my sister.
