review/text: After watching Dr. Berman on Oprah, I decided to order this Stimulator. I heard it was hot, but to my surprise, it was Smokin! I mean smoking! When we put the batteries in the control unit, HOT BLACK SMOKE APPEARED!!!!The next day I emailed Amazon and Healthy & Active (distributoer) to let them know the danger, and received no response. I then called the distributor and he informed me that they did not issue refunds. I could only have an exchange. Yea!If you have a fire extinquisher nearby ,order this, and prepare to use it!Personally, I wouldn't order from Healty & Active after this, as no matter what the defect , they will not issue a refund.
