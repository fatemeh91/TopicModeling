review/text: As other reviewers have mentioned, the bristles on this bend easily and crumple after just a few uses. I use my brush a lot and scrub pots and pans with it, this one is not appropriate for that type of use. They make another OXO brand brush with white handle and bristles (Can get at any major store) and it is much better. I don't see it on Amazon so I'll have to make a trip to the store for that one.
