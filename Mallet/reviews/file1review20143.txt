review/text: I've been taking this product for a little over a month now, and so far I'm very impressed by the results I've gotten! I'm 26 years old and I've always been a bit of a hormonal &#34;mess&#34; so to speak-- adult acne, intense mood swings (an overall general feeling of depression, actually), oily skin, hair that comes & goes in cycles, etc. I never thought there was a solution-- but now I really wish I'd have found this supplement sooner. I've had a noticeable regrowth in my hairline (I was getting very thin around my forehead/temples), my acne scars seem slightly less noticeable, my face is less oily, and my moods have been overall pleasant ever since I started taking this product. I was taking 2 capsules 2x per day for the first month, and I just started taking 1 capsule 2x per day. It's only been a little over a month, and I'm already very pleased!
