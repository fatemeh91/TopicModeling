review/text: I love Rainbow Light products but I was not pleased with this particular product. Who has the time to take SIX TABLETS A DAY, of the same vitamin? If one's life depends on it, then it will be fine. I definitely would not have purchase this product if I had noticed I had to take SIX TABLETS a DAY. I didn't even bother to take any when I realized I had to consume that many tablets in a given day.
