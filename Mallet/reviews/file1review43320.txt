review/text: This is a great cleaning product! The first mistake I made was using too much, making my windows streaky. I quickly learned the issue was that I only needed to use a little bit.... I've started using it not just on glass, but on counters and everything else too...cleans beautifully, lovely mint scent, and really doesn't feel like it leaves a residue. Great stuff!
