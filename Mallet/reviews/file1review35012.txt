review/text: Good forks, a good product. Seller, however, is charging a ridiculously high shipping charge. $8.95 to mail 50 plastic forks? Absurd. With that add on, the price doesn't look so good any longer.Do not encourage this kind of deceptive sales practice, get them from another seller, cheaper.
