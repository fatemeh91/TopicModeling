review/text: My first impressions of these was a little disapointing. They came in a REALLY cheap case, which is important if you plan on reusing these on a regular basis. Also the rope connecting the two is pretty loosely attached. As far as noise reduction, they work fine, besides having to push them rather far into my ear.
