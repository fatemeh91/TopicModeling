review/text: I was skeptical about paying over $20 or more for shoe insoles. I asked myself why should a piece of plastic cost so much? I finally made the plunge and bought the black and blue colored Superfeet insoles. They did help and were better than the original insoles on my shoes. Are they really worth the $30+ for the insoles? I would say no. They offered great arch support and that was about it. I now needed more forefoot cushioning with the Superfeet insoles because their arch support was now making my feet apply more pressure on my forefoot. I saw these Spenco insoles on Amazon and decided to give them a try since they were cheaper. The photos also looked like they had cushion around the whole insole, something the more expensive Superfeets did not have. These Spenco insoles turned out to be better than the Superfeet insoles. They offered the same arch support as the Superfeet insoles and they also offered more cusion around the forefoot area. Are the Spenco insoles worth the price? I say yes. If these were the same price as the Superfeet insoles, I would still buy them.I currently use these in my Merrell hiking boots and average 10-12 miles per hikes.
