review/text: This is a good supplement. It does take time for the regimen to have benefits on your body. I thought they worked okay and helped me with my allergies. If you don't know quercetin has great benefits for allergy and asthma symptoms. This is the ingredient found in foods like apples and onions. It will be beneficial for relieving chest tightness/clearing up stuffiness/sinus. Give it a try, it will help you.
