review/text: I've been taking Rainbow Light Prenatal One for many years, first prenatal, than postnatal (when breastfeeeding), than prenatal again and now again for breastfeeding. So, in total it's been about 5 years so far (without breaks)... They are very easy on stomach and give needed energy. My hair and skin love it too... I decided that I'll keep on taking them even when I stop breastfeeding, why should I search for good multivitamins when I have a proven formula already.
