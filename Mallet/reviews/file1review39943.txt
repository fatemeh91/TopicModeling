review/text: This protein powder is low in carbohydrates and high in protein -- just what the doctor ordered. It mixes well with cold drinks, although not so much with hot. If you want a hot version, better to mix it first while cold, then heat. I am hypoglycemic and it really helps me get past my low sugar moments. it is easy to take a small bag of it in my purse, for emergencies. Also good for a mini-meal in dieting.
