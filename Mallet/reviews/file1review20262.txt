review/text: These are nothing more than pieces of cheesecloth, with sewn edges to prevent fraying. I have posted the picture to clearly show how unbelievably thin they really are. I can't think of anything other than squeezing the water out of cheese that I would be able to use these for. You can see right through the mesh material, so I wouldn't even think of blowing my nose, let alone diapering a baby, or chancing a good shirt on spit-ups with these useless see-through, cheesecloth squares. I'm completely baffled by the number of good reviews these, and similar Gerber cloth diapers get. It is as if the good reviewers have a different product for which they are writing a review for. I suggest shopping in person for cloth diapers, so you can actually see, and feel the material with your own eyes, before buying them.
