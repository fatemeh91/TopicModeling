review/text: I bought one of these for my husband who has lots of water bottles (some with necks only about an inch wide!)that he uses while at work on construction jobs. This brush is the ONLY one we found that actually will clean those bottles. The key is, the skinny part of the handle BENDS so you can reach the unreachable parts of the bottles. I recommend this brush to anyone who uses water bottles on a daily basis.
