review/text: This heat pack is much different than the heat packs you may be used to from the store.It draws moisture from the air and causes moist heat to spread throughout your back in a short amount of time.The pack works great.Tip: Try to keep the pack on it's own dedicated wall circuit. I had the pack attached to a circuit containing two high-watt lamps and it worked a bit odd. When I moved the pack to its own dedicated circuit, all was good.I've been recommending this to friends for purchase.
