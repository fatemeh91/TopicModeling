review/text: I followed the directions exactly and the day after I started I was living in the bathroom with water running out of me. Not sure why, but I stopped because I couldn't be confined to my house and bathroom. I tried it again some months later, and again, the same thing. Needless to say, I got very frustrated and threw these away.
