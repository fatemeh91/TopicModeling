review/text: I have been using this product now for approx. 2-1/2 years. It gives the closest shave I ever got with an electric razor. I use the lotion provided in the cartridge on spots where my beard is rough (chin area).It is somewhat heavier than your typical electric shaver, but the results are great. I highly reccomend this product.Ed
