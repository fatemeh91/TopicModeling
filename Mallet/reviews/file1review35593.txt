review/text: I'm a 62 year old male, 6' tall, weighing 250lbs. Just had my right hip replaced and am swollen. I purchased this seat based on the "Extra-Wide" in the product name. In reality it is not any wider than a seat I already had w/o support legs, that cost half as much. I can not sit comfortably on the seat. my hips press against the arms on both sides, and since my stitches are there, it's painful. Also due to tight space, I'm unable to get another body part down between my legs. Construction and ease of assembly are good, size is my complaint.
