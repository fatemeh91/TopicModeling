review/text: I've tried everything out there for flossing... from the manual stuff like the string and tape you wrap around your finger to those separate floss holding plastic thingys... and all of them are a pain. This device, especially using the pick attachment, is the best thing I've found. I now use the pick daily, as I've found it is most effective at getting everything out from between my very tight teeth. The vibrating is very soothing to the gums and does a very effective job of cleaning between the teeth. I have two hummingbirds - one is for home, and one is kept in my purse for work and travel. After months and months of daily use, I haven't needed to replace the batteries yet. The best thing is... I use them...daily... something I never did with the manual floss. This is so much more convenient, and I have had none of the problems other reviewers have mentioned.
