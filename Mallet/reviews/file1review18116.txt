review/text: The mask keeps it dark during daylight for the most part, though a bit of light comes in through the nose area.I first owned the Dots style and it feel apart after a while, the lining came off. Now I have the all black one and have found it to stain other fabrics and leave black color on what it lays upon - probably including my face.If I find something of higher quality I will move on from this product. But for now I like how it cups over my eyes instead of the standard eye mask which lays directly on top of the eyelids.
