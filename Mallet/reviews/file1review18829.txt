review/text: For all the ladies who saw the African American woman's youtube video:I purchased this product with the efforts that my hair would grow as long as hers (waist length). I am not on my second bottle, the first bottle lasted me well over 2 months taking 2 sips a day. After going through the first bottle I must say I did see a change in my hair texture, length and strength. I cannot contribute it to this item entirely since I do have a consistent hair care regimen, and religiously do my deep treatments, masks and what not. However, I did notice an increase in hair growth (else where) as well as my head, most notably at the crown of my scalp where I have slight psoriasis which comes and goes from time to time. The taste of the item isn't bad at all, resembles a slightly unsweetened juice. I usually drink it straight from the bottle but you have the option to mix with water. As for its intended use (energy) I did not see much of a difference, and I am one exhausted person looking for a natural alternative aside from coffee to make me feel awakened. I think this product that must be used on a daily basis like many supplements for a long period of time to see significant results. I will continue to buy.
