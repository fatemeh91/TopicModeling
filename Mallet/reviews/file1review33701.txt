review/text: This device gives the same reading to everyone who enters the same height and weight, regardless of their actual body composition. Interestingly, it also asks your age and gender, and completely ignores this information also. It will refuse to calculate unless you touch the "electrodes," but no matter who touches the electrodes, it gives the same result. In other words, it is a simple calculator, disguised as a measuring device. If you are looking for a device that will give consistent results, then you're in luck. But if you want an actual measurement, you won't find it here.
