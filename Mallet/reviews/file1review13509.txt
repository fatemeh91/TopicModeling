review/text: I have severe allergies to dust and dust mites. I ordered this, thinking that it was the cure for sneezing and stuffy nose at night. Wrong! Didn't help at all. Only thing that cured the dust mite problem was a temper-pedic 1 1/2 inch foam mattress. It's so dense that nothing can get through it. I no longer wake up in the middle of the night with allergy problems.Invest in a temper-pedic, it's worth the investment for a full nights sleep.
