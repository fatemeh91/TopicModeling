review/text: I was incredibly happy to find and "earth friendly" alternative to the convenient Lysol and Clorox wipes that I often use. And I have tried other products from this line and really like them. Unfortunately, this product didn't have me singing its praises. In fact, it left me gagging. The product has a terrible smell that lingers on...and on...after you use it. Plus, as the previous reviewer mentioned, the container is not well designed and I have had trouble getting the towels out every time. I just bought these and don't know what I am going to do with the five I haven't opened! My biggest recommendation is to buy them at a local store first to try them before buying in bulk here.
