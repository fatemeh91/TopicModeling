review/text: This is a lot of protein which makes it a good deal if you'll use it. I have used the smaller products before so I knew what i was getting. The 10 lb product comes in a plastic bag this is inside of a box. Not as nice as the 5lb jar but not a big deal. You'll save a lot of money by buying this product.This is by far my favorite protein (the chocolate, however I love the vanilla for mixing in shakes, the chocolate can be drank alone with water)
