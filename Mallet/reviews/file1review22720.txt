review/text: I prefer this over pharmaceuticals. I don't notice a big change but maybe a slight change, yet gentle enough that I continue to use it and order it. I like the concept of the body absorbing something natural upon contact with skin or under the tongue. I tend to think it is safer chemically than its pharmaceutical options.
