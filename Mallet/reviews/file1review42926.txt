review/text: I love Mrs. Meyer's products. The scrub, unfortunately, didn't quite work for me. Every time I tried it it didn't lather well and the powder had formed hard little balls that wouldn't break down for me. Also, my sink simply didn't look as good as when I clean it with Barkeeper's Friend. The scent and eco-friendliness of the product deserve 3 stars though.
