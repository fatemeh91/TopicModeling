review/text: So, I got this because I wanted an all-in-one shaver that didn't have 30 stupid accessories for me to store/lose. After searching for a couple of days this fit the bill.The shortest setting isn't quite short enough for stubble, but it works.The blade guard mechanism is still stiff after two years, which is an accomplishment. In most units these tend to fail rather quicklyThe only problem, and it's a big one:The battery. After six months of use it stopped holding a charge for more than a day. Now, it holds a charge for about 15 minutes, but it runs at such a slow speed that it pulls, rather than cuts hair. IIt has the same amount of power that you'd imagine it to have seconds before death, a slow slow slow churning.So, the batteries have failed to deliver enough voltage to do anything, and now it's time for a replacement.Unfortunately this seems to be a theme among Remington products, their touch control razor (i went through 3, all returned) has similar battery issues within weeks. It's a shame because for another $5 per product they could source decent batteries and produce awesome products.
