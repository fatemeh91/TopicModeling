review/text: I use a large 7-compartment pill holder when I'm at home, and were I going to go someplace for a week, then I'd just take that with me. But if I'm going someplace for 2 or 3 days, I really like these because they're easy to pack and easy to know which is which since the day of the week is printed on each.Each holder is divided in half, and while they're big enough for most people, if you take a lot of pill supplements, then they might not be. I don't bother to separate things into what I take in the morning and what at night, I just put everything in and fish things out. (I take most things at night and wouldn't be able to pack all of the night stuff in half of it.)
