review/text: Competing brands of similar products contain at least 50% more product in a similarly-sized container. The disclaimer on the package tells the consumer that the product is sold by weight and not volume and that some settling may occur in shipping and handling (really? It's a powder, people. How much "settling" can there be?) This tells me that they have probably had complaints about this in the past and their legal department created the disclaimer. Either that or they knew it was deceptive from the beginning. I can just picture some marketing genius telling management that by making the container larger, but putting less product inside, they will increase their shelf footprint and visibility, and minimize their product cost while betting that the American consumer is too stupid to notice that the unit cost per oz. is way higher than competitors. Personally, I resent the insult to our intelligence and refuse to buy this product. Tired of weaseling corporations.
