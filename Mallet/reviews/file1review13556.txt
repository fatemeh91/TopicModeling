review/text: I got these insoles since I walk so much anyway, I figured why not make the best of it? I'm so happy I did, because not only are they effective (my husband says my backside looks better than ever!) but they're incredibly comfortable! They add a little spring to your step that makes you want to walk that much more...definitely worth the purchase!
