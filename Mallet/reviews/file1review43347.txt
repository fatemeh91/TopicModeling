review/text: Have bin using these brushes at home for several years. They are excellent for many uses including dishes and scrubbing countertops (different brushes of course.I always like to keep a number of them on hand. They are economical and sturdy and last for a long time.As long as Quickie keeps making them I will keep buying them. I used to get them at Walmarts but lately thay have not carried them so I get them on line.
