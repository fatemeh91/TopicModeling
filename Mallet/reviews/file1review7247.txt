review/text: As you have probably read by now, the drain plug on this unit is designed to fail after only a few uses. It is an odd shape and there's nothing you can do to replace it with something else. When you write to Brookstone to ask them if they can sell you a replacement plug, here is their copy/paste response:Dear Customer,Thank you for your inquiry.Unfortunately, the part you have requested is not available, nor do we have a resource to refer you to. We regret that we cannot be of assistance to you.We appreciate your interest in Brookstone products and hope that we can be of service to you in the future.Sincerely,KeishaBrookstone.com Customer Care Center
