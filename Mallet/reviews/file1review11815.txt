review/text: As a regular user of protein supplements, I have tried several and this product compares favorably to the best of them. This is my first time using Champion Pure Whey and the Vanilla is quite good tasting and mixes well in a blender, or blender bottle with very little after taste, even without adding any fruit, etc..My only complaint is in the packaging. I wish they used the shrink wrap tamper proof lid seal in addition to the paper insert like most others do. That paper seal is rarely attached completely and tampering, or just contamination can occur without the additional safety seal. Just my nitpicking, but enough to make me consider another brand like Optimum Nutrition for example, that does have the additional seal.As a followup on this date (9/30/11) after trying many other brands, I have come to realize that the vanilla flavor of this Champion protein is rather bland. Perhaps bland has too negative a connotation and neutral is a better way to describe it. This is by no means a bad thing, because unlike some other protein powders that are too sweet, this product allows you to add things such as different fruits to suit your own taste. By itself it is pretty plain, but that too is a refreshing change from some of the "cotton candy" proteins I have tried.
