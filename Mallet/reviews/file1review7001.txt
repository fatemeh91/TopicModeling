review/text: At first I was quite satisfied with the product. It fit my needs perfectly for just about a year at which time it started to become sluggish.This sluggishness persisted even with numerous battery changes. I got a solid year's use from the trimmer. The problem seems to be its' limited mechanical lifespan.
