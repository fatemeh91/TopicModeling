review/text: My husbandman says it's his most favorites trimmer ever, and he's gone through a lot of them. It does a fabulous job and holds a charge for a long time. he can use it a few times to trim his thick beard before he has to recharge it, and it's a powerful little bugger. Would definitely buy it again, especially for the awesome price.
