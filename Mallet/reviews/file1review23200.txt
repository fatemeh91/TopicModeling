review/text: I bought this carpet sweeper to clean up crumbs on an area rug under our kitchen table (I've got a 5 and 2 year old). Also thought it would be nice to clean up some lint on the carpeting. I've never owned a carpet sweeper. This one does what I wanted and I was pleasantly surprised. Here's the skinny after a night of rugged use:1. It cleans up crumbs on an area rug pretty well as long as you go over the spot a couple times.2. It picks up lint after a couple passes, but let's face it; it is not a vacuum, you don't get a deep clean.3. Yes, like many of the other reviews, the handle comes apart easily. Luckily I have some black duct tape which will take care of it- no big deal. I expected this based on previous reviews.4. It seems to not work on tile at all. I would avoid it if that is what you are looking for.5. It is easy to push and relatively quiet. No motors.6. Easy to empty.
