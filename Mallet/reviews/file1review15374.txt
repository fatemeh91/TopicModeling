review/text: Since learning Thai massage, I was searching for an affordable/comfortable mat. I was glad I found one with the Shiatsu/Thai mat. It's light enough for me to carry, thick enough to feel comfortable on any floor and well under 200.00 dollars. Thanks a lot guys. Keep up the good job. Namaste.
