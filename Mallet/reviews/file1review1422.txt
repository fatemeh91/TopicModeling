review/text: Great price. Happy to have purchased a Made in USA product. Not as 'nice' as the more expensive Health O Meter that I use at the Fitness Center, but I did not have to assemble that one. Seems a little 'cheap' with mating parts not fitting like they should. The scale is best used on a very hard surface. Our carpetted area with a large piece of 5/8 inch plywood underneath was tippy. Cement basement floor is solid with no tipping. I would recommend this scale.Amazon Market Place seller, Center Aisle LLC, fulfilled and shipped the scale quickly. Five Stars for them.
