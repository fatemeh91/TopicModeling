review/text: This product is a very good clipper. It cuts easily even hard hairs. Can also be used as shaver. The only drawback is that it gets hot in a few minutes. But it seems to be very well built and I can guarantee that it works great in different situations. If you need a strong and professional one, here is a good option. I bought it about year ago.
