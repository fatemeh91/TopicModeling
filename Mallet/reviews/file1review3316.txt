review/text: I bought these tweezers based on the awesome reviews. When I tried them, I found that they were so heavy, and the edge so sharp that it cut every eyebrow hair at the base, instead of pulling them out by the root. Make sure to pluck veryyyyy slowly, if you slip and grab a bit of you skin, you will get cut for sure. I had to run to the store to buy different tweezers.
