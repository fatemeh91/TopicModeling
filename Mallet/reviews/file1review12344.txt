review/text: Ok this will work on fresh spots, not older ones! I got this for a shower door in a house we bought that obviously the previous owners did not clean well. DID nothing to the mold around the door frame. Not even lighten it! I ended up using plain bleach, alot of scrubbing and then found a product from Menards by Rubbermaid that is a mildew/mold spray and that does work. Yes it has bleach in it too and smells, but so did this! I used it to clean just regular soap scum and it kind of worked. Still not worth it. I gave it to my neighbor to use on outdoor furniture and she got nothing too so....will not be ordering again.
