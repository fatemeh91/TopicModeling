review/text: I like to be able to have control of how hot the pad gets using the button. It is large and covers a large area without having to move it around. I like the moisture it produces from the air. It works well. It is quite expensive, however; a little overpriced I feel. Amazon was the cheapest I'd found it so I feel I got a better price than I would have gotten somewhere else.
