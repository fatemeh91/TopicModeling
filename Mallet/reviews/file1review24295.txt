review/text: I had a pair of these for about three years and somehow missplaced them. I missed them so mutch that I had to get an other pair to replace them. The day I got the new pair I found the other pair in the toe of the pair of shoes that I had not worn in a while. I love these insoles they sure help my back from hurting and I won't do with out them. Worth every penney, however I paid more for the first pair from a tv ad. I wished I thought to check Amazon first.
