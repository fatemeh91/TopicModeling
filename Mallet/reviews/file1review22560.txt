review/text: These razors perform very well. I had been using Gillette Mach 3 blades which are quite good but expensive. I've been using the Tri-flexxx blades for about a month and their performance matches the Mach 3 for half the price, and they seem to be lasting just as long! No nicks or cuts. They're surprisingly top notch.
