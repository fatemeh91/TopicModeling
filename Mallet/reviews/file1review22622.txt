review/text: first let me second the notion of all reviewers who mentioned these aren't just good for kids. i've also tried the more "adult" nectar bars, and these are better.also, just try giving them a quick zap in the microwave... the chocolate chips and drizzle get all melty, producing some substantial warm and gooey brownie goodness!i even tried slathering some peanut butter on--the good nutrition info leaves some wiggle room for it!
