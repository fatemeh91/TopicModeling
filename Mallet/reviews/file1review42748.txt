review/text: I've had this shaver for 3 years now, and i'm finely getting around to replacing the blades. The shaver works just as it's supposed to day after day. The battery lasts about two weeks. There is a green light that will tell you when the shaver is done charging, which it does very quickly (surprisingly so). The charger even seems like a good quality one. Typically the power supply on inexpensive chargers get hot. This is due to poor quality, and just wastes electricity. This one barely gets above room temperature, if even that.There is a red light on the thing that is pointless. I thought it was supposed to show you low charge, which it doesn't. It lights up when you're USING the product. I have no idea why, but you can tell when the charge is getting low because the sound changes on the shaver.I would have rated it 5 stars, but it is fairly noisy.It shaves close, and I haven't had a single problem with it. My over-all cost so far has been significantly less than buying blades.
