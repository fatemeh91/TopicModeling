review/text: After reading all of the reviews for adjustable quad canes, I selected this one in silver. It replaces a black one that was provided by my health plan...this one is much sturdier. It is totally adjustable and since I am very short and also left handed it is perfect for me. I read that several of you had problems removing the labels or stickers. Try using a product such an UNDU adhesive remover. It removed the little bits of the label that did not totally peel off and my cane is now lovely and sticker free. I would test an inconspicuous place first to make sure it won't damage the finish. It was fine for the silver paint. I'm also very impressed with the fast shipping I received from this company. Thanks To Amazon and Just Home Medical!
