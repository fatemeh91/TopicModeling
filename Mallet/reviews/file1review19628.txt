review/text: This is the best potty seat ever. Simple to use, no mess to clean up, fits perfectly & securely right on top of the toilet seat. Plus the big bonus...... they get to flush the toilet like a grown up!!!! and its an easy transfer to a regular toilet since there already sitting on it. Plus its a total space savor, its great for the 1/2 bathroom! I Highly recommend this product.
