review/text: This is a review of the "Maxell Battery Cr2016" offer, as offered by MyBatterySupplier. I did not order this item but consider myself a "customer" for purposes of this Customer Review because I did carefully consider buying it -- just as I am a customer when I enter a brick-and-mortar store, whether I make a purchase or not.Please note that the 3 reviews that were written before mine date from 2006. Now, in 2012, the description states plainly that what one is ordering is a 5-pack of batteries. But I have no idea whether I would get 5 batteries or 1 battery, due to the refusal of the seller to state what he/she is selling. Please read the Description, which I quote here from the Web page as it exists today:"Maxell CR2016 5-Pack 3V Lithium Coin Cell Batteries Maxell CR2016 5-Pack 3V Lithium Coin Cell Batteries FA EA-50CF/3D AWI L10 Duracell DL2016, DL2016B Eveready ECR2016 Kodak KCR2016 Maxell CR2016 NEDA 5000LC Panasonic CR2016 Sanyo CR2016 Toshiba CR2016 Varta CR2016"Come on, folks! Are you selling Maxell batteries? Duracell? Eveready? Panasonic? Sanyo? Toshiba? Varta? I lose all faith in a sellers who will not be pinned down as to what they is really offering. So I see a picture of 5 batteries and I see a description stating "5-pack", but the wriggly, squirmy description of what is being sold leaves me with no confidence in this seller.I'm saving my money for a seller who is clear and definite about the product being sold. I hope you will, too. Amazon does not need sellers who act this way.edelran
