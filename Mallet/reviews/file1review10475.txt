review/text: I never received this product. I ordered it from VitaminLife via Amazon, Amazon charged me for it but I never received any information from the company. Amazon gave me an expected delivery date, but the VitaminLife never contacted me. When the delivery dates passed I contacted Amazon, they told me to contact VitaminLife, which I did. I never heard from them. Amazon ended up giving me a refund without me having to pursue it further. I assumed that VitaminLife contacted Amazon and told them to refund it, I wouldn't know since they never contacted me. Amazon was great about it though. I have since purchased something called Gluten Digest from a local Supplement store. It works great and allows me to enjoy gluten products.
