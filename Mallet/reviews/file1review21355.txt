review/text: I'm the type of person who naturally moves my hand in a circular motion when brushing my teeth. So all those high tech ones that rotate don't work for me. This one has a gentle vibrate that allows me to control the motion while it deep cleans better than a regular brush. I recommend it to anyone who has a similar brushing style.
