review/text: When an old back pull recurred, I searched for something that would help in the bathroom. This toilet seat seems to work very well. I like the fact that it does not attach in any way to the commode that would make moving it difficult. At the same time, there is a little tab that fits under the regular toilet seat and seems to keep the unit fairly steady.One thing to notice, if the "Tall-Ette" initially seems too short for your toilet: the blue sponge hand holds also control the length of the legs. If the legs are too short, it is fairly easy to shorten the hand holds enough so that the legs are the correct length.
