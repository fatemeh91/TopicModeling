review/text: I had been unable to have a real bowel movement for several months. All that ever came out were a few small pieces and I had to strain to pass those. I had tried every OTC remedy I could find, as well as improving my eating and exercise habits and supplementing with magnesium & vitamin C. I finally went to the doctor and he put me on Amitiza. It did nothing, and I finally became convinced that I had an impacted colon.After doing some research, I came across Oxy-powder. Since most of the negative reviews I read seemed to be about loose stools (which to me was to be expected), I decided to give it a try. I had to work up to 8 pills per day before I saw results, but again I think I was very impacted.On the 3rd day it all started coming out! I am currently on day 5 and am having several BM's per day.I feel better than I have in months. I don't know what I'd have done if I hadn't found this product, and, as always, Amazon had amazingly quick service!
