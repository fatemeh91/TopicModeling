review/text: First, as was pointed out in the comments in response to Chris Sebastian's review below, these are simply re-branded Sanyo Eneloop batteries. As someone who once loved Sony and then realized that they are far more interested in your money (or in installing DRM on your computer without your knowledge) than in selling you a quality product, I now "vote" with my wallet and avoid Sony at all costs - and so would recommend you get the original Eneloop batteries instead (hence my giving 3 stars).Second, the "best" battery depends on what it's used for and how soon it is used after being given a full charge (days vs. weeks vs. months). For a better explanation of this, see this article [ http://www.gaiageek.com/tech/gadgets/the-best-aa-rechargeable-batteries ] which includes info on the Sanyo Eneloops and other low self discharge batteries as well as the best "standard" NiMH rechargeables. The Eneloops are very good for low self discharge batteries, but not the best, if that's what you're looking for.
