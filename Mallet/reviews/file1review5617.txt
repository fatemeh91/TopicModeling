review/text: I couldn't believe the difference this product made. I feel for the first time that I have some sort of control over my surgar cravings and it really helps keep my sugar levels stable. I don't seem to have low blood sugar drops as often,(probalbly due to less sugar in my diet), and when on the run if I don't get a snack in, I can make it an extra hour. I would reccomend this product.
