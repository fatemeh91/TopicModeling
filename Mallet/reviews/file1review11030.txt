review/text: Cons- These seem to have significantly less active ingredient thanNullo Internal Deodorant, Coated Caplets, 135 Caplets.- Worse, each pill has like 10 calories and two recommended per dose. That's an extra 60 calories per day at full dosage.Pros- As a gelcap, it goes down much easier than Nullo and doesn't as easily stain the hand or mouth.- Per pill, Chlorofresh is cheaper, but it takes about two to equal one Nullo, in my personal experience.
