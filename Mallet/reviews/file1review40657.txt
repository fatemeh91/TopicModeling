review/text: I've tried just about every bar on the market and by far and away these are the best. The taste approcimates a candy bar without actually trying to emulate one. In other words, it is as healthy as it is supposed to be without concessions to people's sweet tooth. The Chocolate Chip Brownie versions are the best, don't bother with any of the other flavors.And if your balking at the price per bar (1.80ea), consider that you could spend a buck on a bagel or a couple bucks on a breakfast sandwich that would be far less healthy. Taken in that light, these bars are a great deal.
