review/text: We love this bubble bath! Although I read reviews that there might not be bubbles, we had no problem-just one capful under running water and you get tons of bubbles! My daughter LOVES them and it helps calm her down and get her ready for bedtime. I am comforted with the smell and knowing she is playing in something safe that isn't going to harm her years later since it's chemical free. Though a little pricey...totally worth it!
