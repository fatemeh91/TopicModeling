review/text: Just about the only fragrance we use is the Apple Cinnamon which quickly freshens the air. We use it in the kitchen and in the bathrooms and it works well for us. Each can seems to last a long time and it is a good value. We like that the scent is not over powering and yet it quickly eliminates odors. We have used Glade for many years and it is a trusted brand with us. We also like that the propellant is 100% natural and does not harm the environment. I recommend this product to you.
