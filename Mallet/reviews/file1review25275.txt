review/text: During Summer 2012 my alergy symptoms were bad. Saw an article that recomended Perilla Oil to help combat alergies. Don't know whether the product I bought through Amazon was substandard or if the recomendation was off the mark. Just know there was no change in my symptoms while using the product.
