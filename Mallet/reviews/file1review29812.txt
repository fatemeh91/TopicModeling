review/text: This product is a great, especially if you don't like water vaporizers. Personally, I don't like water vaporizers because of the mold that can build up in them, and the mess created by them.This product is inexpensive and easy to use. All you have to do is plug it in, pull a pad out of the packaging, put it in the machine and you are done. In less than ten minutes, the room is filled with the vapor and your child stops coughing. My daughter has bad allergies and gets frequent colds and this helps her a lot.Plus IT'S MADE IN THE USA...It is very cheap to buy vaporizer and first set of refills with Amazon. But (sorry Amazon) it is better to buy the refills directly form Vapor-eze (they are MADE IN AMERICA too!!!)
