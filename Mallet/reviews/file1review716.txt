review/text: I love the pen again pen due to my carpel tunnel syndrome. Amazon charges shipping per package so I order from the seller direct to reduce shipping charges on my large orders. The refills don't last very long due to I write a lot and they are smaller than other refills in order to fit into the pens. Refills are the way to go as they reduce plastic consumption.
