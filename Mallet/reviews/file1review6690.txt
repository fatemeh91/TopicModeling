review/text: This looks like an instrument of torture BUT it's an instrument of well being. Last year, I purchased a book on Acupressure Points. It suggests laying on tennis balls to reach important points in the back. HA HA HA!! RIGHT!The Back Buddy is designed to reach vital acupressure points on the back. You determine the intensity of the pressure.I have a large bone structure so I was very happy to read another review on the less expensive Back Buddy. A PETITE lady said it was perfect for her. If you're not petite - this one is perfect.No more uncomfortable knots in my back, shoulders or hamstrings.
