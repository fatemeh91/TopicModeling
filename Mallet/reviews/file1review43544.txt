review/text: I recently purchased an Omron 711 A/C BP monitor and was getting high readings at home. I took it with me to the doctors office and he was baffled to see that readings I took with the machine in his office were 10-20mm higher than when he took the BP. We did it at least 5 times. He had recommended that model and apologized and told me not to use it anymore.
