review/text: We have an old house,(1890),so though we've updated the plumbing as much as possible, our sink and drain lines will not accommodate a disposal. The guy from Sears had to jury-rig the installation of our dishwasher a bit. We have what is called a standpipe into which the machine drains before going into the main sink drain.When the main pipe is overwhelmed with water, the joint at the u-bend will drip and the standpipe will overflow. I had actually taken to putting a bucket under the sink when I ran the machine! Also I was noticing a foul odor when it drained. My partner was afraid the drain would require disassembly to clear away debris in the standpipe and drain.I bought the Dishwasher Magic to clean the inside of the machine, as it had become stained over time.When I went to wash the first load of dishes after using the product, I set the bucket, as had become my custom, and stayed in the kitchen while the machine ran, in case the sink learned a new bad trick.Neither the kitchen drain nor the standpipe leaked a drop! The bucket was bone-dry when I checked it. Dishwasher Magic cleaned all of the blockage out of the standpipe and drain.It cured what might have been an expensive plumbing call. No bad smell this time and the machine is spotless! I love this stuff!
