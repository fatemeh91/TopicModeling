review/text: I bought this for my husband for his birthday and it lasted exactly 31 days. After that the power button quit working and the drain plug broke. I sent it back to Brookstone, as it was outside of the 30 day store return and they promptly lost it. and are now saying I'm out of luck even though I have an RMA number, a tracking number from the shipper and the original order number from Brookstone.I won't ever buy anything from Brookstone again.
