review/text: I thought this was a larger version of the waterproof band-aid material you would find at your local pharmacy store but it is exactly the kind of tape I use to tape my ankles up before a hockey game.I bought a roll of it to keep my nicotine patches on while I do lap swimming at my local pool. I bought it for $8 bucks but I could have bought it much cheaper at my local hockey shop.To stay on point though, It works as waterproof tape but as expected leaves a sticky residue that is tough do get off afterwords.It would work fine if you had a cast on your leg or arm or even stitches where you need to tape a plastic bag over the cast or wound so you can take a quick shower.
