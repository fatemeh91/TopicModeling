review/text: I read that B1 can build up in your system to prevent bites. I took this faithfully for 4 weeks and saw no improvement. The product itself seemed fine, no complaints about the smell or taste but I am left wondering if a different brand would be more potent and help. I am extra attractive to mosquitoes.
