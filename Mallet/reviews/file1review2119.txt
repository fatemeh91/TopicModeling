review/text: This is a great product. We have a coffee carafe that had been in use for 7-8 years in an office coffee club situation. It had never been really cleaned ... just rinsed out. The bottom of the carafe was stained with built up coffee sediment. When you looked inside, it was black all around.I filled it with boiling water, added 2 teaspoons of Dip-It, waited 20 minutes and when I poured it out, it looked like coffee. When I looked inside, I could see the shiny stainless steel interior of the pot. It was about 95% clean, so I repeated the process with only 1 tsp and the pot looks like brand new. Haven't found another product that does as good a job.
