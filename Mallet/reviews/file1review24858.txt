review/text: I am 36 years old, my husband and I have been trying for four years, did IVF twice last year but failed. After taking FertilAid and FertileCM for three months, I found out today through pregnancy test that I am pregnant. Hoping and praying that everything will be alright. I hope this review will help other women who are trying to get pregnant. Thank you very much for this fertility supplement! By the way, my menstruation is regular and did not have any problem.
