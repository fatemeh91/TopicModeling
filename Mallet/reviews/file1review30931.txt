review/text: I used baby bath tubs designed to fit in the kitchen sink with my 3 kids and was surprised to find them not readily available in stores anymore when my oldest had twins. This tub is similar to the ones I used and better designed. Why lean over a bathtub when you can comfortably bathe babies in the kitchen sink?
