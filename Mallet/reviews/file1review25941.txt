review/text: The construction of the charger allows it to lose connection with the batteries= no charge. It overcharged/heated the included batteries to over 140F- I couldn't even handle them bare handed. It is, in my opinion, a piece of junk. I would not buy one of these... I should've listened to the other reviews.
