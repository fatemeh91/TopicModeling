review/text: I love this product! It has a very crisp authentic rose fragrance that largely fades from your skin over the first hour or two, though it lingers on your clothes, so it is not overpowering. I love rose scents, Joy being my favorite perfume, so this is just complementary for me.It is effective and long-lasting. It does not just cover up odor, it actually stops it and prevents it. I can't say enough good things about it.I do with it were less expensive, as it can add up. So, I don't always use it around the house, sometimes I will just use a cheaper brand on days I am not going anywhere, to save this for when it matters!
