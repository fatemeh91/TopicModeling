review/text: This mask fits nicely on your face, doesn't put a lot of pressure on the eyes and WHEN COLD it feels great. The biggest drawback is the cold sensation doesn't last for long. Mine lasted for 10-15 minutes and that was it after being in the freezer overnight. I just ordered another one as I like to have a 30 minute session. I just wish they could find a way to make the chill in the gel last longer-- the mask is just the right size (even for a guy).
