review/text: Product tastes good but within 20 minutes of consuming it I was extremely hungry. Sounds good, tastes good but still has a lot of carbohydrates, sugary carbos that fuel the appetite. The Optima line of Slim-Fast does NOT control appetite for up to 4 hours as the label claims. This product would work if someone has a iron will and impeccable self-control but then any person with these attributes most likely does not need to use the product.
