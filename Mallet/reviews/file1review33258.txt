review/text: Pros: I love the weighted feeling to this wrap. It fits nicely all around with the longest section going down your back (from the base of your neck) about 7 or 8 inches. The quilted sections allow the contents to be distributed evenly throughout.Cons: If you are not careful when heating this in the microwave you can singe the contents. I now fold it and heat it 1 min 30 sec, then turn it over and repeat. Otherwise a great product. You just have to remember that herbs and seed will burn :)
