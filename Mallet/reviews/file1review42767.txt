review/text: I bought this product after reading all the good reviews thinking it would help me also. At first I had the usual bloating that was expected. I took it for about 3 weeks. I only took one scoop a day. I developed a red spotted rash under both eyes with hives! I was shocked when I saw it in the mirror! I also purchased their multi for women so I didn't know what was causing it. I stopped the multi first...no change. Sadly I had to stop the Primal Defense and the next day my rash was half gone. I don't know what they put in it, but I'm apparently allergic to it. I've never had a reaction to probiotics like that. Must be the controversial soil bugs..maybe we're not supposed to eat dirt? I hope this is helpful for anyone who is sensitive to supplements like I am and have this reaction. So far I seem to be the only one who has. I'm going back to acidophilus!
