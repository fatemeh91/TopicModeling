review/text: I wanted to write a redeeming review of this product. I had to experiment with it quite a bit to get it to work right. First of all, it does work, at least for me it does. I have both regular stainless steel (range, oven, microwave, and dishwasher) and a 'cleansteel' fridge. The first few times I tried this product, I was unahppy. It did cause streaks. But then I discovered that you REALLY have to buff/polish the steel with the microfiber cloth to get it right. Granted, the surface you are cleaning has to already be pretty clean (so I have to 'preclean' my range). Also, the microfiber cloth has to be washed frequently. But it does work. I get compliments all the time on my appliances. My neighbors have the same appliances and they were astounded at how good mine looked when they came over for a dinner party.
