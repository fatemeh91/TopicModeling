review/text: This is a terrible product that should not be sold. After a few months the battery refuses to charge and hold a charge. Tragically, the device only runs off batteries. When the battery finally died after about a year of owning this product, the trimmer would not work even when it was plugged into a wall. It really sucks when you've trimmed half your beard and your beard trimmer dies and will not charge any more. Not very stylish.Even when the battery was working, the blades were not very sharp and the device did not trim very well. Don't waste your money.
