review/text: It takes forever to secure an appointment with my dermatologist, obtain a prescription, and finally have the tinea versicolor treatment available at my local pharmacy. If I'm lucky, it would take 1 week for the entire process, and that's if I'm even able to schedule an appointment within the next month -_- On top of that, the prescription shampoo and ointment that I receive for my tinea versicolor smells like sewage, takes forever to work (approximately 3 months before the spots and shiny dry patches start to disappear), and stains my clothes if I accidentally touch them with the shampoo on my skin.I ordered Fungasoap because my dermatologist appointment wasn't until next month, but I really couldn't wait to treat my tinea versicolor (it spreads and gets worse every day; it spread from my stomach to my back, and from my underarms to my arms)Wow, does this stuff work. I am so so so happy with the results! I've only been using this for a week and a half.... The spots are already fading, the itchiness from the dry patches of skin are subsiding, and this stuff is really not a hassle to use, unlike my prescription treatment. I'm not saying this will definitely work for you if you have tinea versicolor, because I've tried other remedies like selsun blue and it did nothing for me. Then again, it really doesn't hurt to at least try this soap!
