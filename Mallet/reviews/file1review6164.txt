review/text: I started a diet program through a medical weight loss clinic. They proscribed an Adkins type ketogenic diet and phentramine type medicine. After the initial ketosis symptoms, headache, and fatigue ended, I began to notice changes in my memory. The brain normally uses carbohydrate based fuel, but in an ketogenic diet it must fuel itself from stored fat. As I adapted I noticed an increase in my short term memory, and a loss in my long term memory. So I started taking this product to help. I've finished to bottle and I feel like my memory and focus are great. Despite the sleeping issues I have on the phentramine stimulant/appetite suppressant, I am still able to recall the tasks that I had prioritized and the stage of completion.Pro's: it seems to work. Medium price range. It's a blend of useful supplements. It contains two types of Ginkgo, fish oil, Choline, and DMAE.Con's: Recommended dosage is 2/day, so a 60 count bottle only last a month. I have not heard of some of the other ingredients and do not know their effects.
