review/text: I am going to purchase one here from Amazon. We bought one a few years back at Bed Bath & Beyond? but I can't remember. We love it.Every day we use this to wash out bottle/protein shakers, it works very well. The head of this fits into a variety of bottles well, such as re-used gatorade, iced tea, and milk bottles, baby bottles too. Not all bottle brushes fit into smaller openings well, and still able to clean the interior bottle surfaces. The shaft of it is flexible too.The bristles are just right - they are also somewhat soft, which is great. Many other bottle brushes I looked at have super stiff bristles and don't clean out things well or work as well with dish soap. The foam/sponge type bottle brushes (like for baby bottles) fall apart and get gross pretty easily.Every now and then the bristles get too dirty, well then just fill up a cup of really hot water and dish soap and wash it a bit and rinse out.This is a great price here too.
