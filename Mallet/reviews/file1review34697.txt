review/text: I develop blisters on the bottom of my toes when I run long distances. For an upcoming marathon, I decided to try these out to see if it would add more cushion so that my toe wouldn't hurt as much. Big mistake. Only a few miles into a practice run, it felt like my toe was going to explode. I ended up taking off the toe sleeve and my toe felt better without it than with it.
