review/text: I was pleasantly surprised with this trimmer. For just around $15 it's ideal. It comes with just one guard that can be height adjusted by a dial on the trimmer. Cleanup is a very easy as you can just remove the guard and fold back the trimming head and clean out all the hairs. It has a nice ergonomic shape that fits your hand comfortably and is light weight. For the money I think it'd be hard to find a better trimmer in this price range.
