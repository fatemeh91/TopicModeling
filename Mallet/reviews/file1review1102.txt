review/text: I have the Bandit product and got another one but wanted something that I can alternate and wear at work without looking like a lost squash player.This did not give me any relief and after adjusting it every which way it just did not cut the mustard. The only time it gave me relief was when it also kept blood flowing to my fingers.I would give it one star but I am going to use it as a fancy - and pricey - cuff guard instead so I don't get chain grease on my trousers.
