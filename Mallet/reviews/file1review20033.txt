review/text: This tub sounds ideal but it's not. For one, there are areas where the tub folds where your child can get his/her toes caught and stuck, very unsafe. Also, if you put it over a sink, you can only put so much water in before the weight is to heavy and the folded parts fold in and as your baby grows he will get to heavy to put this tub over the sink as the ends will fold in.My son is now 4 months and we are going to purchase another tub. I dread each time I have to use this tub, especically because of the folds your baby's toes can get caught in.
