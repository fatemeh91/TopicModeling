review/text: After typing the title for this "review," I realized I had pretty much said it all. Its use doesn't require any instruction: you just pop a little package into the door of the dishwasher -- and that's it. For as clean as everything emerges an hour or so later, I'm convinced that little package must contain about a dozen or so little men hard at work cleaning and polishing during that hour.I've used this product for the last six months or so and have consistently found it as good or better than any other dishwasher detergent I've ever tried -- and that means just about all of them. There's not one that does a better job than this. So I'll stick with Finish. But I must add one note -- I have a very poor sense of smell and therefore cannot comment on the orange scent claimed for the product.
