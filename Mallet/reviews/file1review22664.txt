review/text: Likes:1.) It really is heavy duty; industrial strength really.2.) Sturdy and well built3.) Effective when giving massage to another person, provided you know what you are doing.Dislikes:1.) It's too heavy to be used comfortably for self massage. It's really not appropriate for anything other than large muscle groups and easy to reach places. Tried it on arms, shoulders, neck, without any real effectiveness. Found it very uncomfortable to use due to its size and weight.2.) Location of control knob makes it awkward to use in certain positions.3.) When using it on myself, it did not have the kind of muscle penetration I had hoped for, not even on quadriceps, hamstrings and calves where I was able to control or moderate the pressure.Bottom Line:It is a quality, heavy duty massager and it has limited applications for which it is very good. Unfortunately it did not really fulfill my needs or expectations.
