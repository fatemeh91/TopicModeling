review/text: I bought this product since it doesn't have parabens and I want an Emu Oil product that doesn't have too much bad stuff in it (artificial ingredients, artificial color, etc) that in the long run is unhealthy. Turns out this product is loaded with all sorts of unnecessary chemicals, along with the coloring agent. Worst of all, though, it is the least useful emu product I've tried so far. I put it on and felt absolutely no benefit. I compare that with the "Original Blue Emu" product that I use which despite having parabens and blue coloring has a strong quality healing, soothing effect. This Ultra Blue product on the other hand seems to have the lowest quality emu oil and/or the enormous amount of useless artificial ingredients (probably created by a dysfunctional group of suits in a committee where each suit was able to add more toxic gunk to the product) in it to render it ineffective (and likely toxic in the long run). Also, the texture of the product is idiotic, instead of a smooth cream easy and pleasant to apply, it is a dribbly mess of fake blue goo that bounces, drips and slips off the hands instead of easy to work with. I'll never use this awful, low quality product ever again, I'm throwing it into the trash. There are an enormous amount of emu oil products out there and likely nearly all of them are superior to this one that is appallingly bad.
