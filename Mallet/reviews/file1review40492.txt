review/text: i have severe pain in my knees when it rains or the humidity goes up.i have tried all the other things on the market,bengay icy hot,etc..and there is something about jointritis that just works!!!im so upset about it being pulled from the shelves of the stores without explanation!!!ive never had a problem with it.now they are promoting stop pain as an alternative but stop pain doesnt do anything for me.it doesnt have what jointritis had.no problems with this distributor just charges twice what it used to be in the stores,but it really works and i was desperate to get it back.
