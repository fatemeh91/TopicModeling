review/text: This is a great brace for the money. I've tried all kinds for my "tennis elbow" and this seems to be the only one that really seems to help. It's not totally pain-free tennis playing, but much better with this brace in place! The only downfall seems to be it's lasting power. I've gone through 3 in the last year and a half. I play tennis about 4 days a week...so it could be just overuse. Anyway...I keep buying them so I must like them!
