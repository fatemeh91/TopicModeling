review/text: I originally bought the Double Rich Chocolate based on good reviews, and its impressive 24g of protein per serving. When I first tried to mix this with water, I couldn't believe how bad it tasted, I have never worked so hard to get a protein shake down. I tried mixing with milk and it didn't taste any better. I ended up throwing the container away after using only 4 scoops. What a waste of money, luckily I only bought the 2lb. size. I suspect that they may have changed the formula on this, because most of Amazon's 5-star reviews for this product are over 2 years old.I've since switched over to Designer Whey's chocolate flavorDESIGNER WHEY Protein Powder Supplement, Chocolate, 4-Pound Containerand the difference is remarkable. I mix one scoop with about 6oz of hot water and it tastes like a low-quality hot chocolate, much better.The downside to Designer Whey is that it only has 18g of protein per serving, but that's partly because the serving size for Optimum Nutrition is 17% larger (30.4g vs 26g). If you were to use the same amount of Designer Whey, it would have 21g of protein, which brings it's numbers much closer.In short, I would highly recommend you buy a small size of any protein supplement to test it out and if you don't like the taste of this, try Designer Whey.
