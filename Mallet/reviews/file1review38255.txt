review/text: Shipping and delivery were right on time. Because this is a powder, it does take some stirring to dissolve into water, but that aside it is a great product. Haven't used it in protein shakes, baking or soups yet, but think it would probably work really great as a thickening agent. Like the fact that using just a small amount has a ton of fiber and is very effective. This bag will last us awhile.
