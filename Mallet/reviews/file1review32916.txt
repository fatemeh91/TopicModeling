review/text: This stuff never fails! When the winter blues kick in and the comfort food becomes my best friend.......there are many days I feel bloated and constipated. Now, before I even get to that point I have this tea before bed and it always works wonders after my first coffee in the morning. I know...too much info, but it's true. I have tried other lax options and many have worked only a few times then stopped. Once I tried this brand of tea, I started to use the detox tea too along with Cranberry water reducer. My clothes don't feel tight and I feel great!! I'm obsessed and don't have to watch what I eat so very often. Love, love, love this herbal tea brand.
