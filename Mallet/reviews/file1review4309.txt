review/text: All the blades in this package were super sharp and provided many smooth shaves. I recently bought what I thought were the same blades but was sadly disappointed as they were dull, they pulled the beard and did not trim as advertised. The trimmer was installed incorrectly which leads me to believe they were knock offs.
