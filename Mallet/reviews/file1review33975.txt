review/text: I was shocked to see Propylene Glycol in the ingredients. This is a cancer causing solvent that scientist Hulda Clark has found to be present in the majority of cancer patients. Propylene glycol is used in anti freeze for cars. According to the latest scientific studies, propylene glycol is as deadly as benzene and both solvents cause cancer even in small amounts. Unfortunately, scientists recent studies on the effects in the human body shows that propylene glycol builds up in the body even if ingested in very low quantities. The reason for the build up is that the liver takes five days to detoxify propylene glycol, after a person stops ingesting it. So, if someone is ingesting it on a daily basis, this burden on the liver allows propylene glycol to build up in the body to toxic levels. Also, the presence of this solvent burdens the liver so much that it cannot rid the body of parasites. Many scientists believe this is a major cause of cancer....parasites and solvents in the body.Update: Wikipedia also states that propylene glycol is known to cause cancer.
