review/text: I love the creme and the smell. The price and the shape of the container not so much. It's only 16 oz and the container is a short and fat.. I have to carry it around the table with me because it doesn't fit in my handy dandy massage belt. Your better off buying 68 ounces for $46 then 16 ounces for $20. 16 ounces x 4 containers = 64 ounces for $80. Just buy the 68 ounces for $46 you wont be mad about it! Now I just have to work on not using so much at a time. I like to glide working my way into a deeper massage once the creme has been absorbed abit.
