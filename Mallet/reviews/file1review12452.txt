review/text: Having suffered from PF for some time now and stubbornly refusing to try a night splint, I feel silly for having waited this long for relief. The item stays in place during the night, feels relatively cool and non-invasive while wearing, and is lightweight and comfortable. I noticed a reduction in the pain of those first 20 steps the morning after the first night of use. My plantar fasciitis is still present, but is diminishing day by day with continued use of this product. Thank you. This night splint arrived rapidly even with free shipping. The product exhibits a high degree of quality and simplicity in its manufacture.
