review/text: I bought this because previous reviews said how great it tasted. My 3 year old smells everything before eating and detects everything I put in her drinks/food. She did not like it. I tasted it myself and although it is minor compared to other vitamins, you can still taste a chalky flavor. I managed to put it in her apple juice, she drinks it--slowly, but not as much as she would without it.
