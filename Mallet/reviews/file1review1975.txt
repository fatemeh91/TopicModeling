review/text: If anyone is looking for a way to fix your skin, I recommend taking these. Of course only under a doctor's supervision.An early treatment of acne first used during the 1930s was high doses of the fat-soluble vitamin A (retinoic acid). At these dosage levels (sometimes 500,000 IU per day), sebum production is notably reduced, thwarting acne, but overly dry hair is a negative side-effect, and such high doses can lead to vitamin A toxicity. Use of animal-based vitamin A at nutritive levels (where the upper limit dosage is 10,000 IU daily), taken over the course of a year, has also been shown to reduce acne.Source: WikipediaBe careful with the intake though, large amounts of Vitamin A are toxic... but so is Accutane. You be the judge!
