review/text: We have 2 of these in our office. Two weeks ago an employee had a heart attack. Someone started CPR and I hooked up the the AED. After 5 shocks the womens heart restarted and she started breathing on her own. The ambulance response time was more than 10 minutes. (This is faster than average in NYC) Without the AED this 40 year old women would be dead. Two weeks later she is back at work.The device is very simple to use. The most important thing is to avoid panic. And don't give up, keep at it until the ambulance arrives.
