review/text: I was sitting on the fence between getting this bottle brush an the other one that had two other attachments. I went way from that one because I read that it was almost two feet long. Too long. This brush is really good. Bristles are soft enough to bend to allow the brush to go through a smaller openings yet firm enough to get the corners. Good product.
