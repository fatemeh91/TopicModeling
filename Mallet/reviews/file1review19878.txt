review/text: I'VE BEEN TRYING TO POTTY TRAIN MY ALMOST 3 YR OLD LITTLE BOY SINCE HE WAS 18 MOS. I TRIED SO MANY DIFFERENT POTTY CHAIRS AND EITHER THEY WERE UNCOMFORTABLE FOR HIM OR MADE A MESS WHICH WAS FRUSTRATING FOR BOTH OF US. SINCE HE'S A BOY, A GUARD IS VERY IMPORTANT. THIS ONE IS PERFECT. I'VE HAD THIS ABOUT 2 MONTHS AND HE IS DOING GREAT. ITS COMFORTABLE, EASY TO USE AND NO MESSES. I ALSO BOUGHT THE MATCHING STOOL. HE REALLY LIKES THAT AS WELL TO SIT ON HIS POTTY OR WASH HIS HANDS AFTER. I RECOMMEND TO ANYONE.
