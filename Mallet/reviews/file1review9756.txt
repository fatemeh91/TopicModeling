review/text: Great tweezers. Now, if I could only manage to not be so determined! Obviously there is no rational for a "user's manual", but conceptually, that might help me quite a bit so that I stop causing wounds. Having the finest of fine hairs is to your disadvantage, but that would apply to any tweezer.Overall, I simply love them and just need not to be so aggressive. These tweezers indeed are very nice and sharp!
