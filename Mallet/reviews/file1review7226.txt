review/text: I bought this heated foot bath after I broke my ankle to help promote circulation. I've had others that were not heated and they were a disappointment. This one is fantastic. It keeps the water heated to a toasty temperature and doesn't cool down. I also like the powerful water jets and the remote control. I highly recommend this product.
