review/text: I grew up using cheap slant tweezers for grooming brows. I rarely bothered. Until I hit my middle years and then, well, I wanted better groomed brows. I invested in a pair of Tweezerman points and never looked back. Now that I'm older and have sparse eyebrows, i don't need to pluck a lot, but I still buy these when they need to be replaced (or the Rubis point, also good) to take care of the excess hair that seems to show up at menopause. I may not have bushy eyebrows, but these help me pluck the slightest hairs and ingrown hairs and keep my browline very neat. I even use them on facial hairs (forehead, temple, upper lip).Good quality. And if you use one of those high magnification mirrors, you can end up with a really clean look around the eyes that makes you look BETTER. Shaped eyebrows make such a difference.Note that if you have shaky hands, this is not the one for you. The point is sharp and you have to be CAREFUL.Enjoy.
