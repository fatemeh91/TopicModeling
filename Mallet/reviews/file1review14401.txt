review/text: I like Ecco Bella because of their policy of not testing their products on animals - because of that I made the assumption that their products are vegan. Some are, some are not. This blush is not. That's too bad, because I really like the way it looks and lasts. Here's some info from Ecco Bella's website - it might just make you shop for vegan cosmetics:Currently all products can be used successfully by vegans except for the following lip products which contain carmine: Lipsticks: Pink Rose, Mauve Rose, Claret Rose, Tuscany Rose and Napa Grape, Good For You Gloss: Power and Passion. Our complete line of Lip Crayons also contain carmine. Blush colors that contain carmine are Burgundy Rose, Wild Rose, Orchid Rose and Coral Rose. Our Beige and Medium Beige Cover Up sticks contain beeswax.Carmine is a purified version of cochineal extract, used as a dyeing agent in foods and cosmetic products. The carmine dyes derived from cochineal produce a natural red or pink color. Cochineal is an insect, actually a beetle, that is found in Mexico, Central America and South America, dating back to pre-Hispanic Mexico. The greatest concentration of cochineal beetles are known to be in Peru, where large numbers of villagers are employed to harvest the beetles for use in the manufacturing process. The dye, commonly known as carmine, is extracted either from the dried bodies of deceased female cochineal beetles or from the unfertilized eggs laid by female cochineal beetles.Nasty. I don't want dead insect bits (or the dye that comes from them) anywhere on my body....!
