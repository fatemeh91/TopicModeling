review/text: The pictured product above says "Triple-Action Weight Control" and the one I received only says "Liquid Soft-gel Weight Control." I looked everywhere on the box and found no mention of any "action" that this product is supposed to do. The product description on the back basically encourages you to follow the enclosed diet program and says that the pills are supposed to give the energy you need to follow it...Oh, really?! How fantastic! I took the pills anyway, they did absolutely nothing for me, not even the energy I didn't ask for. Maybe they found out that the product is useless and changed the packaging to avoid getting sued? Who knows...Amazon should change the misleading image above, so people would know what they're buying.
