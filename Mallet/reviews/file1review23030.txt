review/text: I bought this for my grandma to make it easier on her to clean up instead of lugging out the huge vacuum. I actually bought it to replace her old one. She likes it very much BUT it is not quite as good as her original. But she would tell me if it didn't work or she didn't like it so it MUST be good! :) I'm going to get one for myself eventually too.
