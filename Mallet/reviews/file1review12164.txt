review/text: I received this item today and it was a box of 30 tablets in a blister pack, of Rainbow Light Prenatal Care Just Once vitamins, NOT what is pictured. Amazon is resending the item...hopefully this was just a mix-up. But, beware you may not receive what is pictured.These vitamins are great..I just hope they are able to send me the right ones!
