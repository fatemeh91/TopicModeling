review/text: This trimmer works great. Cuts smoothly with plenty of power. Easy to clean, lots of adjustments. It holds a charge for a long time and is a good size in your hand. My only complaints are that the start button is on the right side, (obviously designed by a lefty), it should be on the other side so it can be operated with the thumb, and that it is made of a rather slippery plastic. Haven't dropped it yet, but I can't believe they can't think these things through. Great product. Highly recommend.
