review/text: Wow, product does exactly what it promises to do! I couldn't be happier. Being gluten soy and dairy sensitive, getting enough fiber has been hard for me and caused a lot of issues. I have been searching for 5 years for the fiber that is right for me. I can't tell you how happy I am with this product! Delivered fast, price is just right, I've taken it every day since it arrived a week ago I can't tell you how much better I am feeling. This has really helped correct a wrong in my body that I've been battling .
