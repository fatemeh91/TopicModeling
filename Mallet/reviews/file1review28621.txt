review/text: As far as protein powders go, ON's Gold Standard line can't be beat. Using a special blend of Whey Protein Isolates and Peptides, it delivers protein to your muscles faster and more effectively than a lot of other products out there.I won't pretend to be any kind of scientist or nutritionist, just a regular guy who lifts weights and depends on ON Gold Standard to help me recover from my workouts and help add muscle to my body.Personally, I think the Double Rich Chocolate has the best taste, especially when mixed with milk. It mixes just fine with water, too, but with milk it ends up tasting almost like a nice, rich chocolate milk!And as far as the price and delivery schedule from Amazon, it really is head and shoulders above everything else. I have done a LOT of research online for the best price points for this protein powder, and amazon blows them all out of the water!This product is offered cheaper other places online, but then they hit you with insane shipping prices, and it ends up being a lot more expensive. If you get this product as a "subscribe and save" option, it's less than $19 for a 2lb tub, and the shipping is free! That is insane! If you don't believe me, spend a good half hour or hour looking on the web for a better deal, when you're done looking, you'll come right back here and order through amazon.For people who demand a great tasting, effective product that they know will give them results, this is it. Especially if you're getting in the gym regularly and want something that you can use daily, the "subscribe and save" is the way to go. Shipments show up on time and with no hassle, and you always know amazon will have your protein for you! I can't recommend this enough.
