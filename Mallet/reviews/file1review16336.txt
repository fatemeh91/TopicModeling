review/text: Finish is the only brand of dishwasher detergent that works in my machine. Both Powerball and Quantum by Finish are excellent. I usually buy these in the grocery store only when they are on sale, but I saw these on Amazon at I price I rarely beat in the store, so I ordered a couple of boxes. Would definitely order again at this price.
