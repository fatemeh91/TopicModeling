review/text: I ordered this Zippo as kind of a joke for my dad. He quit smoking (thank goodness), but collects Zippos. He has two display cases, and is working on filling them. We have bought just about everyone out there that looks good! I ordered the orange because it is my son's favorite color, so I thought it'd be cute for his 5 year old grandson to give it to him at Christmas. More sentimental than anything. Product arrived quickly, in great condition, and was purchased at a price that can't be beat.
