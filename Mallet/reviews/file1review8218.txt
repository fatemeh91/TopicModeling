review/text: This bottle brush is great for cleaning things your hands or dishwasher can't reach. I use it on my blender because the blades are very sharp. This is good for tall tumblers or Thermos type bottles, as well. Most parents use something like this to clean baby bottles. It doesn't hold onto food particles and cleans easily. The handle is the perfect length for really tall items.
