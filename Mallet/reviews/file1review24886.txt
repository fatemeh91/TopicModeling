review/text: I was getting Depo shots until recently my husband and I decided to try for #2. I wanted something to help me start ovulating/menstrating again so I took a chance on Fertilaid. I was very skeptical but I took it 3 times daily as instructed and with 9 pills left in the first bottle, I'm menstrating! I'm thinking prayer had more to do with it then Fertilaid but it couldn't hurt to try it.
