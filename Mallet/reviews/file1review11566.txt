review/text: I am so totally disappointed by these batteries that I could simply spit bullets. I bought them for my digital camera about four months ago. I am *not* a big photo enthusiast so only grab the camera for "special" events like the kids recital at school, birthdays, and so on. Imagine my dismay to find that all eight of these batteries totally lose their charge after sitting for a day or two after a recharge. I've even tried a different recharger....same results. The no-name batteries that came with my camera work like a charm....these name brand tripe are heading for the recycle bin!
