review/text: When I moved to NYC last year, I had to strip down to the essentials, which didn't include my vacuum cleaner. Since we were moving into an all wood floors apt, I thought I'd get by just fine with the roomba and a broom, and I did...for a while. Unfortunately there are always those little nooks and crannies where brooms just aren't effective...under couch cushions, on top of the kitchen cabinets, under the bed... Without room to store a full-size, I decided a hand-held was the way to go and the reviews lead me to this one. I love it! Having it around has decreased my stress-level when it comes to the hairballs and dust bunnies which I was constantly chasing. It's powerful suction and easy to clean filter combined with the hose and floor attachments are ideal for small spaces like mine. And when I'm done, it fits oh-so easily under the bed. The also thought to use a super-long cord which means I can walk the perimeter of an entire room without the hassle of unplugging. I'd highly recommend for anyone looking for something compact or a quick-reach alternative to the full size version!
