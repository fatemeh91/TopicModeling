review/text: This is my second Pocket Rocket. They work and are not expensive. I have had issues (as stated by others) about turning it on only to have it stop... but I found that it has a touchy turn dial and you just have to turn it back just a tiny bit to engage it. I also have an electric unit (a different and MUCH more expensive brand) that I love, so if you want a marathon affair, choose something that plugs in (and has a very long cord). For a spur of the moment need, this one works great; which lasts for years, and is cheap.
