review/text: If you're looking at this, you know about what this product does. It really works. Take a full dose (3 vials, about 5-6 hours apart) when I start feeling sick with sore throat, fever, sinus nasal drip or runny nose, and it always cuts the cold short. I'll get the same thing as others in my family and when I take this, I always get over it faster. Not a gimmick, this stuff works.
