review/text: When I first started working out I just bought the regular GNC brand protein and it was ok but I really didn't want to drink it so I gradually left the weightlifting scene behind. Now that I'm back in it I read some reviews and decided to buy this brand but unfortunately GNC only had Double Chocolate (not a choc fan) but I bought it anyways. I just use water since I can't tolerate milk that well and it still taste amazing and I don't even like chocolate all that much. I shake mine and have never had a problem with clumping or anything. There are other products that have a lot more protein per serving but why down a shake that taste like [...] once a day when you can drink this at every meal and more. Will order Vanilla next since that flavor is my favorite so hopefully it taste just has good. Buy from Amazon, GNC is too expensive.
