review/text: I love this tub. WE had a hard time bathing baby when she was a new born. She could not be submerged in a tub since her umbilical cord was still attached. She HATED being sponge bathed. She would scream during the whole bath every time. When we finally got this tub, she just loved bath time. We put a little water in there, and made sure it didn't reach the cord. She loved being in there.On the down side I wish it was a bit deeper, and that the leg section wasn't so raised. Once baby was big enough to sit up, that's all she wanted to do, and bath time was not excluded. She wanted to sit up in the little tub, and I just felt she could just come right out on her own, so we had to move on to the big tub. She is still quite wobbly, so we had to get a tub seat for that. But I just wish that the tub would grow with baby a little, so we could use it a bit longer. Anyhow, we enjoyed it while it lasted, and we still use the duck in the big bathroom to hold her toys. It works great!
