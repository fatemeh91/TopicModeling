review/text: This product cleans well - works well on monitor and TV screens. It has a pleasant mint scent (rather strong for the first minute or so, then fades) which, for me, is an added advantage - I have a couple of tom cats that spray anything and everything they can reach - including my monitor. They apparently don't like the scent of this cleaner - they haven't sprayed my monitor since I started using this. I haven't tried a quick spritz in other areas yet - but this works better than any of the "cat away" products I've tried.
