review/text: I vehemently dislike using condoms but need to use them.... I was ready to give up on intercourse but I gave this a try and it made intercourse a worthwhile experience. I'd prefer not to use a condom but if one had to use one , this would be the one. My partner is almost too large for this but it fits him, very fortunately. Durex extra sensitive, the other competing condom, did not come close to this.
