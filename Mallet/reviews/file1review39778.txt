review/text: Howard's Orange Oil was recommended by a kitchen cabinet retailer and I'm glad we heeded his advice. It cleaned our cherry wood kitchen cabinets well, leaving a nice sheen & an aroma of citrus orange. The product is quite rich, so make sure you aren't too liberal when spraying it onto the cloth before wiping. I'll definitely use this on all our other wooden furniture.
