review/text: Rather than repeat the correctly glowing recommendations others have posted, I will say just one thing.On a recent rare visit to my doctor I called ahead and asked if I could bring my Omron HEM 711 to compare with the hospital's blood pressure equipment. They said "sure".And, yep - my Omron gave the very same reading as the professionals' carefully calibrated and maintained hospital BP equipment!Buy this thing. Seriously. It is completely accurate and will give you some potentially life-saving numbers about what is going on inside your body... and all in the 24/7 convenience of your home.
