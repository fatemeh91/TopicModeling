review/text: OK. Every once and a while a product comes along with a simple premise and does EXACTLY what it claims to do. This is one of those products.Please don't think I'm exaggerating when I tell you that if you have trouble night-breathing, this product will literally change your life.Breathe Right strips afix to the bridge of your nose and gently attempt to straighten, opening your nasal pasage. I have seen complaints that this tickles, but if you have that problem, you are likely wearing the wrong size.If you snore, the intensity of that snoring will be greatly reduced or eliminated altogether.If you wake up with morning headaches (or achey brain, as I like to call it)because of trouble breathing, you will learn what it feels like to wake up supercharged and alert.If you wake up with dry mouth, or get sore throats every year because of nightime mouth-breathing, PROBLEM-SOLVED!I come from a family that has all of these issues because of our small nasal passages. Some family members have even had surgery to correct it, to dissapointing results.Listen and believe. Breathe Right strips ended this problem for me!All I can tell you is, if you have this problem, you MUST try this product right-away. Take it from someone who knows what a terrible chain-reaction poor breathing can spark!
