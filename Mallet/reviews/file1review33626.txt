review/text: This waterpik is very good. It has a mechanism by which you can set how strong you want water to be pumped. It flosses your teeth well. It's easy to use. I bough it for my parents and they are not that good when it comes to dealing with electronic products since they are a bit old, but they are easily learnt how to use this since it is simple to use.
