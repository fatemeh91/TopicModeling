review/text: I love it. LOVE IT. If you could not stop wiggling a loose tooth as a kid I think you will like using this to poke and prod your recurrent and/or recalcitrant knots.I have shoved pens into the space between my neck and shoulders and practically THROWN myself into corners of walls to try to get sufficient pressure to the right places without much, if any, success. Especially the neck part. With this tool I can reach exactly the spot and maintain constant pressure. It gives primal relief in places you didn't even realize were knotted.It is very sturdy plastic. I believe it will last for years. I will throw away all of the little gadgety tools I have purchased over the years.I love it. I may even buy one for my office.EDIT: I have had this product for a little over a month and I still love it. It really increases blood flow after you release pressure and you can dig it into the problem areas (mine are my neck/upper back/shoulders)and hold pressure easily. If I intend to sit for any length of time at home I have it with me to work on my knots. This is a VERY effective device.I have several favorite parts of this device, but I would have to say the curved part with has two round nobs with a space for your spine between is my favorite. After a day of work my neck is often killing me and this works quite smoothly on the back of your neck AND IT DOESN'T PULL THE BABY HAIRS which just completely obliterates all pleasure one can receive from a nice neck massage. It doesn't pull the baby hairs even without fabric or oil.My one critique would be the shim lines which still remain after manufacture. Even though they are very small, tiny even, they can still be felt if you use the knobs on bare skin. They are easily whittled down with a razor blade.
