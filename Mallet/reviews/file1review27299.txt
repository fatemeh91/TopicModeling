review/text: I tried the "Extreme Milk Chocolate" based on a review below. It's not bad but far from the best tasting protein supplement I've tried (my fav' so far is Bio Chem). The powder does dissolve better than most and the price is right - especially with a subscription. I wish it used stevia for a sweetener rather than sucralose and other artificial sweeteners. Next time I'll try "Double Rich Chocolate" for a chocolate flavor, or skip chocolate altogether. All in all, I'm very happy with ON protein powder.
