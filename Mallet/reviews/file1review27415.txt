review/text: OK, so this review will cover the taste and smell because I just started taking it but I will upload a result review along with exactly the list of other products I'm using...The smell when you open this is like you just opened the front doors to the willy wonka chocolate fountain room! Your mouth instantly starts to water! And the taste is just as amazing... feels almost sinful if your on a great diet. I drink this every morning before my morning jog and as my 1st meal replacement. I put in my Black 28 Oz. Blender Bottle W/wire Shaker Ball with a raw egg,2 1/2 teaspoons of peanut butter, about 1/2oz vanilla bean soy milk, and also a teaspoon ofOptimum Nutrition Creatine Powder, 600gand 6-8 oz of water. I think the taste is delicious and I am ready for it every morning! Now again I will post up a results review after faithful routine usage.
