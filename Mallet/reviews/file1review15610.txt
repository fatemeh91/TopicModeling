review/text: This product should more accurately be named "Deoderant Glue". I only applied it once and that was enough for me to know that I was unhappy with this product. The deoderant is about like semi-hardened glue. It was extremely difficult to rub onto my skin. When I put my arms down and lifted them back up, the deoderant actually made my armpit skin stick to other surrounding skin. And then I tried to wash the deoderant off my fingers, from where I had applied it....very difficult. I had to wash my hands 4 times and they stick felt a little sticky!I left the deoderant on for the day, instead of trying to wash it off as I was so tempted to do. After a couple of hours, the sticky eventually "soaked" into my skin??? I did not try to reapply the product the next day because my underarms were already irritated from all the attempted rubbing-in of the deoderant from the day before.Personally, I was seeking an alternative to regular deoderant due to a sudden allergic reaction to my current deoderant. I was under the impression that this deoderant was intended for folks, like me, with sensitive underarm skin??? If this is why you are seeking out Lavilin, look elsewhere. This deoderant just caused additional irritation to my already irritated underarms.FYI, I ended up finding that I could use Arm N Hammer Natural deoderant, in the fragrance free formula. I recommend trying it first as it is readily available at most drug stores :)
