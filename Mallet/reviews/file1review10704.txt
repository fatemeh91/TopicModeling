review/text: I ordered this to manage my 83 year old mom's meds. it is wonderful. She can easily manage to open the lid on each compartment without disturbing the other three so that only the meds. for that time of day are dispensed. Because there are seven individual containers she is able to slip one days pills into her purse for travel and shopping. I am ordering another set so that we can take two weeks worth of meds. on our trips.We are also both grateful for the solution this product offers for knowing that pills have been taken.
