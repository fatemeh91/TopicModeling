review/text: A friend of mine turned me onto these. Saw it in his house and thought it was some kind of torture device. Once he explained how it worked though, and I was able to use it, I was sold.I workout a lot and often have stiffness in my back. I get massages on a regular basis, but sometimes I need something NOW! Got one of these things and it helps me out considerably. For me, not as good as a professional, but it keeps me pain-free (more or less) until I can get on the table of my therapist.The one downside to this product is the size. It's not portable, so if you want one for more than a single location, you'll probably need to buy more than one. I need one for my office, which is what lead me to look here. This is a good price, by the way.
