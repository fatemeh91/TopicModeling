review/text: I purchased this item for my 'on the go' husband. Before, he would not take his morning pills because he wouldn't think to take them until he was headed out the door. He also was often away from home at lunch or even dinner. With this item he can take the current day of pills in his pocket with him. He's much happier now and so am I.
