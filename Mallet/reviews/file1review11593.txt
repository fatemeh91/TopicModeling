review/text: I purchased a high-end battery charger (Lacrosse)and of the 3 different brands of batteries that I use, these are by far the worst in terms of how long they hold the charge. I fully charged two of them 3 days ago, and just put them in a Logitech mouse. Immediately got a warning that the battery level was "critical." Never again!
