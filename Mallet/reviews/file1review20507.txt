review/text: I agree with the first reviewer. I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this product. My daughter also wets on the pad between the old diaper and the new one and so we had to purchase a solid changing pad to avoid wet spots on our bed. The problem with the product is that it has stitching between the quilted areas and they must use a big needle because there are stitch holes that allow wetness to just leak right through. I want my money back!!
