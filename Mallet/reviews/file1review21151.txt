review/text: This is our second Thermophore 14 x 27, first one lasted about ten years or so, and we liked it enough to replace right away.With temperatures up around 165 degrees, this will get in deep to your muscles and joints. A few rounds of 20 minutes on and 20 minutes off will work wonders.One of the best features is that this pad is weighted all over with many flat metal weights that make it conform to your body for great contact and heat transfer.Use with caution and read the instruction manual for warnings. See the Thermophore web site for more details.Seems a bit expensive compared to standard heating pads, but it's in a class by itself and worth the investment.Note, Don't be confused by the "Automatic" wording, it has a hand operated normally OFF switch. The Automatic refers to the moist heat since you don't have to wet it at all.They now make the same unit with an automatic timer shut off switch if you might like that better than the manual switch that this one has. This one you have to hold the switch down to keep it hot, that way if you doze off it shuts it off.The other is called "Automatic" with "Automatic switch"BTW, the shipping service by 'The Therapy Connection at HPMS, Inc' was outstanding and it arrived in just a few days time. I'm sure that can vary, but my order shipped fast!
