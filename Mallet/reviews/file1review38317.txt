review/text: I am a HUGE fan of the Emjoi line and of epilators in gen'l, so .. if you don't mind the mild pain (in time, you do get used to it) then this is a quality product line. HOWEVER, I am a much bigger fan of the cordless one. This one, with its spinning motors in diff directions, actually got stuck and broke (after a bit more than a year, when I was totally hooked on its superior speed and efficiency). I haven't bought it again b/c I love the cordless one and the travel size one so much. (I hate the cords and these two seem to last a bit longer.) My first cordless one lasted several years so I had to replace it. This Optima one is so much faster, but that cord is uninspiring after you've been cord-free for so many years. Stellar product line.
