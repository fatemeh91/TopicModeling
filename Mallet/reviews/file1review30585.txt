review/text: This chest of Homeopathic Remedies was a real find for me! I love the original hard plastic case, the new ones come in a flimsy cardboard container. Homeopathic remedies do not expire, so very happy to have bought this. There was an issue with the purchase, but the seller was awesome and we made it work.
