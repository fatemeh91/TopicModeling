review/text: I purchased these not for a professional fit, not for a product that is going to last 20 years. It was cheap, and it worked exactly as stated. They fit great, and they were amazingly easy to mold. If you can't figure it out from the instructions, there are videos online. If you need whitening trays, save yourself some money and buy these!
