review/text: Thanks to this horrible deodorant, I have damaged over 20 shirts of mine. This deodorant works great and does the job, however you soon realise that all your shirts are becoming damaged. You will notice large yellow stains under the arms of the shirt, where you applied the deodorant. These stains DO NOT come out and your shirts will be permanently damaged. This is one of the worst products I have ever used. Stay far away from this horrible product or risk losing all your favorite shirts.
