review/text: I bought this thinking it would help with sleep and restless leg syndrome which I occasionally get after Gym.Honestly, it did nothing in those two areas.It is however helping me with Acid Reflux which I have been suffering from for the last 5 months. Magnesium is like an anti-acid and this product is reducing my heartburn a lot when I take it an hour after dinner at night. GREAT STUFF.
