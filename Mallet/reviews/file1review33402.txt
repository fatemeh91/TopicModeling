review/text: I know every face and beard is different, but this seems perfect for me. My first experence with a real blade after years of electric and I have not cut myself at all, but still shaves smooth. I'm loving the &#34;real&#34; shaving experience, my face feels great and I actually enjoy shaving now, after hating it for year.
