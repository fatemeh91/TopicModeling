review/text: I use these for our kids when they're young. We have some consistent bed wetters, and these pads do a great job of keeping the underlying sheets dry. If there is a problem, the kids take care of it themselves. They just throw the sheet protector in the laundry room, along with any wet clothes, and they can easily grab a new one (or just sleep on the sheets, since no one has more than one accident a night. Would definitely recommend when searching for sheet protectors!
