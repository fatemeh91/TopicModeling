review/text: I purchased this item for my mother to organize my father's many medications. Unfortunately, she was unable to use it due to the small size of the pill holders. I would suggest this item for someone who takes small pills or less than 4 pills at a time. This is not a good item for someone who takes multiple pills that are large.
