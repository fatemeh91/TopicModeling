review/text: I had the worst morning sickness in my 1st trimester! I took some advice and ordered Ginger candy and it worked like a charm! I was still in school and working and I never had to call in due to sickness because of these babies! I recommend them to all my pregnant friends, and they all agree. Its also an awesome alternative to tums when you have to take something for a belly ache. I still eat these when I'm ill. Great buy!
