review/text: I'm diabetic and these socks are the best I have ever worn.Searched a week on line to find them before trying Amazon.Got first ones from podiatrist's office but they are 2 or 3dollars cheaper per pair here so I get 10 or 12 pair at atime. They are soft, comfy and stretch if feet swell. Youwon't regret getting them.
