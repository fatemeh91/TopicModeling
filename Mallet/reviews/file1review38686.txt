review/text: Unlke Lawyer Girl, I really like this product. Perhaps her issue was using the solution with normal contact lenses, but I switched to a 'new' contact material (silicon hydragel) in the Acuvue Advance contacts and use this with it. The combination is spectacular! I can wear my contacts for nearly 20 hours without any problems, when I used to have to take them out after no more than 10.
