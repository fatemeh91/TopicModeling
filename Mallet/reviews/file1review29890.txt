review/text: Initially this wrap feels wonderful, but after a little while you might find it to be a little hard. Still it does feel great to start with and its hard to turn down the wonderful smell the herbs give off and the fact that it can be warmed in the microwave and it's so easy to clean. You won't regret getting it. :)
