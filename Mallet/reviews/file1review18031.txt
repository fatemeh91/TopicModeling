review/text: Of all the eye masks I've tried, this one is by far my favorite. I love that the mask doesn't touch my eyelids, and I only have VERY minimal light leaks. My hair does get stuck in the velcro closure at the back, but I have a large head, so I find that most other eye masks are too tight. I'll sacrifice a few pulled hairs for something that fits properly. I'm on my second Bucky mask because I accidentally washed the first one with my sheets and the backing came off of the mask. They're delicate and should probably only be hand washed. I'm completely satisfied with this mask and doubt I'll ever have a desire to try another style or brand.
