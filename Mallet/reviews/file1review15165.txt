review/text: I thought this product was great because it tasted good and the nutritional value is very high. I would really recommend this product to others -- especially those who may be in a program like Weight Watchers. I am in the Weight Watchers program and this brownie is only a 6-point item in the program. So it's wonderful to use as a snack. It tastes just like a regular brownie with nuts in it. I heated them up to enjoy them even more, so they were nice and warm and chewy.
