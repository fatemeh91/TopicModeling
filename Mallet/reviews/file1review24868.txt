review/text: I was a little nervous to try this after reading that it had interrupted some women's already regular cycles. But my husband and I had been trying for 10 months with no luck. I took this for a month and got pregnant! I couldn't believe it! I did drink the tea for about 2 months prior with no luck, but one month of the pill form did the trick! I'm now 11 weeks pregnant :)
