review/text: I purchased this product after reading many reviews and deciding that ON was the best way to go. This is now the second time I have purchased from Optimum Nutrition and so far all has worked very well. I use the product to help me rebuild muscle after fatigue from exercising. It also works good to hold you over if you don't have time to eat a meal right away, it will keep me full for around 2 hours.
