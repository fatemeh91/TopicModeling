review/text: My boyfriend had suffered from terrible athlete's foot for years when I met him. I've made it a mission to help cure it. He said he's been to doctors numerous times and it never improves. His feet are red, cracked, peeling and insanely itchy. The shower always hurts his feet and makes them itch more.After buying a few products from the store (lotions, etc) and not showing any improvement I started looking online which led me to this stuff. The product smells a little funky (the whole bathroom will smell like it after he uses it) but it has really helped. He's nowhere near cured but the cracking has stopped (his skin hasn't split in awhile), the redness has gone down and they don't itch near as much. We're pleased with the results.More recently we've also started bleaching his feet which sounds crazy but does help!
