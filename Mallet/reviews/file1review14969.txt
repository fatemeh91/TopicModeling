review/text: I started taking this vitamin for my nails and it works great...they have stopped splitting and my nails have never been so strong. I have not really noticed my hair getting any stonger but it does grow faster. The only downside is the terrible smell...I have to hold my breath when taking the vitamin but for me it's worth it. I wouild recommend as a daily multi-vitamin.
