review/text: I have used ON Double Rich Chocolate Gold Standard 100% Whey for a while now and have really been satisfied until my last purchase. I purchased a new 5.15 lb in May and this container smells almost like spoiled milk and taste the same. I have contacted Optimum nutrition about it and I am waiting to get a response. Has anyone else had this problem? I mix it with water and has been great until this package. I would ahve rated it higher if not for my problem with this current batch. I hope I am not out $40!
