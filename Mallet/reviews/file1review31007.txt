review/text: I am rather disappointed with the taste and appearance of this product; the pills are large, powdery and taste dusty. When I take them with liquid I can still taste them hours after. I'd give them 1star for that. After lots of experimenting I now take them with food which seems to be the solution to the after taste. I do have one BIG plus though; they really provide comfort within a week! This is why they get 4stars, I wish they would make the triple strength pills like the double strength pills, which are gel caps.
