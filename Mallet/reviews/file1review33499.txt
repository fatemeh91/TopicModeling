review/text: There is not much to say about a waterpik. This one arrived promptly, was well packed and worked.The disadvantage of this one is that the top does not fit when you are through. The actual pik is in the way.I shopped around however and for me this is the best model. May be it is time to design a more practical one.The cord is long enough to reach anywhere on your bathroom counter.I had the identical model before and it worked for years, until mysteriously the water stopped flowing throuhg the handle.
