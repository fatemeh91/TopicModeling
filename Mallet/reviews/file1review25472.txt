review/text: Quality product. Most trimmers break within a month and are cheaply constructed. I have had this product for over a year and it still runs on it's original batteries (only use once every 2 weeks). It pulls on hairs occasionally, but it the most powerful trimmer I've had. spins like a jet engine
