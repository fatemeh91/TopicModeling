review/text: I ordered this and was very happy with how quickly it arrived. It came to my house in perfect condition, unopened and unhurt. Works pretty much as well as the refills i buy at local stores. My only reservation is that it seems like i cut myself more than usual, i cut myself quite a bit in the shower, and in the three years i have been using these razors, that hasnt been the norm. Might be a fluke, but over all I am very happy with this purchase from this seller.
