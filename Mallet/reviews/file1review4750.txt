review/text: When I was placing an order a system was updating causing an error(quantity) on the web site. I did contact a seller after receiving my order and within a few hours I got an email back. Next day I did receive another email with an information that they shipped additional case. I am very pleased how the Customer Service solved this issue. Also shipping was very fast. Quality of product is very good too. Markers have fine yet soft tip (very good for drawing on the skin). I will definitely come back for shopping to this seller.
