review/text: Bought this as a travel seat even though they have other ones that fold. Am happy we got this on b/c she's used to the Bjorn little potty. This one was an easy transition to the big potty and she felt secure sitting on it by herself. Takes some room in a suitcase but it's worth it since it's an easy transition and she liked it.
