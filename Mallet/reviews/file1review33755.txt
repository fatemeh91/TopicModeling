review/text: while not terrible uncomfortable, i find the arch support in the wrong place for my feet; the support feels too low and too much in the center to properly support my arch. thankfully they have a money-back guarantee, so if you buy them, make sure you keep your receipt, just in case they don't fit your specific foot.
