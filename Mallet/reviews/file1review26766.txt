review/text: This is some great tasting protein that mixes very well. I use it with water or milk and it always tastes good. Has BCAA (Branch Chain Amino Acids) added in unlike some other proteins. Very happy overall and am on my 5th bottle. I find Double Chocolate too be the best flavor. Hated the Vanilla Ice Cream. Plain vanilla and strawberry flavors were pretty decent too.
