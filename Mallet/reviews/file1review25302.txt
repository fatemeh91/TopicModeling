review/text: I originally used this supplement for its then stated purpose of increasing blood circulation in the legs. I have used the product for many years for this purpose and it seems to make a difference. I can definitely tell if I forget to take the supplement even for a day. With the advent of viagra, etc. the supplement was relabeled as a male performance supplement. I cannot state whether this is actual or not. However, I do have normal sexual relations on an average of three times a week and I am 75 years old. Whether this supplement has anything to do with that or not, I cannot state as I use the product daily.
