review/text: this is one of the best tasting protein drinks i have ever had. additionally, the consistency is second to none. it is not thick, it mixes up very well w/ a shaker bottle, and only requires a small amount of liquid (i use skim milk). the vanilla allows you to mix it with other flavors so you aren't just stuck w/ chocolate, for example. i've used orange juice to make an orange creme drink (awesome). the vanilla by itself is awesome. add some ovaltine, you've got an excellent malt. i've mixed it up with a spoon just to try it out and it worked okay. but not as good as the shaker bottle w/ wire wisk ball. bottom line is, i'm not sure you can do better than this protein. i haven't tried other flavors, but i don't need to. i also have BSN Syntha-6, which is equally excellent. i use the ON for post workout and the Syntha-6 for general suppliment. both are incredible in all aspects. some reviewers here have issues with some of the flavors. i wonder if they ever drank protein powders back in the early 90's. cause last time i did the protein thing, they were all nasty. times have definitely changed. for those not enjoying some of the other flavors, go w/ this vanilla. you can add your own flavors, or have it plain. it's really a great tasting drink. one note: i don't use water to mix with. to me, water seems rather strange to use. use skim milk. or OJ. or a combo of stuff. i've tried half water and half skim milk (cause i ran out of milk) and that worked out fine.
