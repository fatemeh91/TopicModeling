review/text: After an entire year of suffering from infections (UTI's on and off, Vaginal Infections, at one point I actually had a Blood Infection, I also had constipation issues, weight loss, Chest pains, intercostal pain etc...) I added this into my daily dietary Supplementation. The bottle lasts quite a while at 2 capsules per day - which is good if you are trying to clear parasites from your system, since it would kill the current infection and also last long enough to kill any new parasites which hatched from the first round that you killed. (I have read that wormwood, or artecin as it's called on this bottle, does not kill parasite eggs). Anyway, after all of the antibiotics my intestines needed support, so I paired this with L-Glutamine Powder Daily (I used Jarrow Brand) as well as a daily high quality (refrigerated) probiotic supplement. (It was suggested by a teacher that I was suffering from leaky gut, which I am not sure of, but regardless, all of these supplements helped me fight off the infections along with Grapefruit seed extract, which is a [controversial] antibiotic. All of the infections that I had were resisting modern conventional antibiotics, for whatever reason, I have no idea...) All have been extremely helpful in my constipation issues and helping my body's immune system and natural healing process. Just for the sake of detoxing my system and general maintenance, I intend to use this product one to two times yearly, probably as a spring and fall cleanse.
