review/text: I started taking fenugreek several months ago because of supply issues and noticed an immediate difference. However, several weeks ago, my supply started decreasing again. I had been taking three pills, three times a day. I started taking four pills at time, then five. Still no increase. While discussing it with a friend, I realized that the decrease started about the time that I changed brands. I went back to my old brand, and my supply immediately increased again. I'm not sure if the bottle I had was just old (the expiration date is 2014, so I don't think it is) or if this was just a bad batch or what. All I know is I won't be buying this brand again.
