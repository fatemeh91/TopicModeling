review/text: This kids multi tastes pretty good, avoids the bad fillers and sugars found in grocery store brands, and covers the vitamin basics. The only shortcoming is that it contains only 200 IU of vitamin D, which is half of the latest recommended daily amount from the American Academy of Pediatricians.
