review/text: Absolutely thrilled with product. Had my stethoscope since 1994, it broke about 6 months ago and I was devastated. Searched on Amazon and to my amazement you had the replacement parts I needed. Easy to assemble, following the directions. Quick shipment. I have a brand new stethoscope! THRILLED
