review/text: I am giving it to my 13 month old son on my pediatrician's recommendation as his weight is in the 20th percentile. He is a healthy kid and eats fine so this is used only as a dietary supplement. He likes the taste and drinks it at night before going to bed.If you look at the list of ingredients, it has about 50 different things. How can such a highly processed food be good for a one year old baby who has not been exposed to too many environmental contaminants as yet? I just can't help wonder why kids' nutrition drinks and/or formulas these days have so many ingredients. Why can't they be simpler? We will find out how these things effect kids' health only after a few years......and I hope it is good...
