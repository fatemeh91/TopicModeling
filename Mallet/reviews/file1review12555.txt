review/text: AWESOME!!!!!!!!! Totally Awesome product. I am a believer in alternative medicine being a huge resource for all people. This product made me want to eat better and start my exercise routine. I can't believe that there are people who feel this clear headed, energetic, light, and bouncy, happy every day. Now I am one of those people.On the second day of this cleanse I felt such an intense relief in my head. I say it's as if someone attached a faucet to my hip and let all the crap drain out from the top down. My energy is way better than if I go and get a double shot expresso Mocha with whip and caramel from Starbucks. Don't stop at reading these testimonials, get it for yourself. This is going to be my present to others from now on until all my loved ones have tried it. X-mas won't be the same this year.On day three I felt like having a salad really really badly and haven't lost that feeling yet even though I am only maintaining now. I plan to go back on this 7 day colon cleanse next week and look forward to it. I have tried Colonix but the fiber drink got to me and so did the laxative tea. I couldn't be bothered and it was only working sometimes. I felt discouraged until I found this. Now I use it with Toxinout and feel like I am seeing major progress. I am small boned and almost 160lbs but I feel like I my weight is 20lbs less. It's as if I didn't gain any weight at all. And I am not dieting, just having more veggies sometimes.
