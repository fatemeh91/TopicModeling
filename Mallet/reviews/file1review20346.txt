review/text: I found this cloth to supremely exceed my expectations. It's twice the size of other lens cleaning cloths that come with glasses purchases, and it seems very absorbent. That might not be the right word.... My other cloths I use seem to leave streaks behind, no matter how much I swirl and buff. This one actually seems to wipe up the liquid cleaner as it polishes my lens. Quite simply, I'm ordering a second one right now to keep at work.
