review/text: I usually use the Seventh Generation stuff (which works well for me) but took a chance on this gel because it was a little cheaper. It is AWFUL! It leaves all of my dishes covered in specks of food. It's almost as if somehow this soap grinds up any food that's left on the dishes into a powder and fine mists it onto everything. I do use a separate rinse aid but that didn't help. I'm surprised with all the negative reviews this product has that it's still selling.
