review/text: I guess there's not much to say about any deodorant except that works or doesn't. But anyway, this Speed Stick gets the job done fine. I like the Ocean Surf scent and it gave me no problems in terms of itchiness or dry skin. My one recommendation is to apply perhaps twice a day since, for me, the scent ran out after a several hours.Otherwise if you need to freshen up those underarms, this is a nice deodorant for the job.Darkhorse86
