review/text: I think this pre-shave product is good in general. Once on, the razor glides quite nicely. Not too greasy (though greasy can be good sometime, eg. 'Williams 'lectric shave'). But the application of it is poor ... the hole in the bottle is too big! The product spills out more (on purpose? for profit?) when you shake-squirt it on your hand/s. On other brands, like Williams, the hole is much smaller, and easier to apply; hence less messy.That flaw aside, I think this is a good value overall. I may write the manufacturer about this! The poor application design.
