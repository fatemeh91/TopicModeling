review/text: This unit delivers as advertised. We just had an alert from the state that our town water failed a recent test. So they chloronated the heck out of it. Our filters did not get the odor from the water, but the ozonator removed all traces of any smell and any microorganisms. Out coffee tastes like coffee again. I think this product is well worth the money.
