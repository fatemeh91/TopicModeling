review/text: I received this dildo as a gift from My Wish List. I wouldn't have added it to My Wish List had I known how nasty the thing smells! I washed it well with soap and water after opening the package. It smelled so badly that I decided to leave it sitting on My counter to air it out. It's been 4 days now, checked it every day and it still stinks really gross! This material might be latex free but I'm not sure I'd want to use it when it stinks so badly!Now I find out this item can NOT be returned. Hate being stuck with products I don't want!! I do NOT recommend this product when there's so many similar dildoes that don't smell so badly!
