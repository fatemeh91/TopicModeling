review/text: I was given specific guidelines by my surgeon, post-op Weight Loss Surgery, to drink a protein drink with more than 20g protein and less than 10g carbs per serving, 3-4 times per day. There are so many options on the market that meet those guidelines and making a decision can be quite daunting. I found Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard in a CAKE BATTER flavor and I was sold!Now, for the most important part of reviewing any protein drink... IT TASTES GREAT!! I'm so happy for the flavor options. I can't wait to try all the others. I am recommending Optimum Nutrition to all bariatric patients.
