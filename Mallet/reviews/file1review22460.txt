review/text: As a vegetarian I really need a vitamin with iron and also want good, solid dosages of vitamin C and other essentials. It's so refreshing to find a daily vitamin that not only has all the basics but that also includes whole food supplements -- and for a decent price. Many other comparable vitamins are either overpriced or skimp on valued ingredients. The instant I came across this brand I felt that I found what I needed, and after taking them for two months I haven't been disappointed.
