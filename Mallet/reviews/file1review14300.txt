review/text: I have had a cool skin razor for several years and always liked it. I finally got around to replacing the heads, and the difference in shave quality was dramatic (my old blades were at least 5 years old). However, I only give this product three stars because the blade kit is expensive to replace yearly as recommended and only includes new blades, not an entire new blade assembly. I didn't expect this, but for $30 it would have been nice, especially since, as other reviewers have pointed out, the blades and assembly have a tendency to accumulate residue, particularly if you don't use the special Nivea shave cartridges. (I want to be able to use a big cheap can of Barbasol dam***!) Manufacturers are entitled to charge what they wish for their products, but I don't have to like it.
