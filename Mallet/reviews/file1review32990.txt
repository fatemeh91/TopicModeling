review/text: We are doing a home exchange vacation here in Nanaimo, Vancouver Island, BC,CA from Fountain Hills, AZ USA. The home has a fabulous new front-load Miele laundry pair, which I had never tried before, as well as a giant box of PERCIL Universal Pearls Laundry Detergent. While at first sceptical of the VERY small amount of Percil needed per load, as well as the barely-there water level in the washer tub, I was then blown away by the SUPERB RESULTS! My clothes and linens have NEVER looked and smelled this fresh and clean! I will be looking for a mega box of Percil to take home with us in our RV (which is our travel mode) and will be seriously considering changing out my old top-load washer and dryer for a front-load, water-saving pair at the next break-down opportunity. The stingy amounts of water required would be perfect as well for arid AZ. GREAT!!!
