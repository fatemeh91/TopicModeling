review/text: This bottle smells so good, I thought these would taste even better than the Nature Made orange flavored C tablets we usually take. Boy was I wrong. Colored with red cabbage????? Did they think the flavor wouldn't get in there too? Who needs color in their vitamins, artificial or natural? I wish I had read reviews before purchasing.I understand why some people awarded stars for "quality". But I don't see what's so hard about making pure, natural vitamin C tablets, so I'm being a toughie and 1 star it is. I'm so cheap I'll probably end up using them. Doubt my husband will touch them.Edit: I just finished reading the rest of the ingredients. They also contain rose hips, which many people (and my pet chinchillas) like, but which I detest. Live and learn.
