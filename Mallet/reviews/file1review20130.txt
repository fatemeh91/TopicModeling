review/text: I'm 27 years old and am at risk for PCOS. This means that I while I DON'T display most of the symptoms (such as obesity, hair loss, acne, insulin resistance) I almost NEVER had a regular period (unless I was on birth control) - off BC I'd be lucky to get it once a year. Doctors told me I would have to stay on Birth Control or start taking harsher drugs such as Metformin. In my opinion these drugs don't target the issue, they only mask the problem. I wanted to help my body cure itself. So last year I went off BC after readingDr. Bob's Drugless Guide To Balance Female Hormonesand completely changed my diet to a strictly whole foods, plant based diets (no processed foods, no meats, no dairy) in hopes of helping my body achieve hormonal balance. The change was AMAZING! my body is like it was at 16 (I was never fat but I went from weighing 145 pounds at 5'7 to 122 pounds), my skin looks way younger, my eyes seem bigger, and my energy is way higher, but my period still hadn't come, that is UNTIL i added DIM-plus LAST WEEK. I am happy to share that I GOT MY PERIOD TODAY - NATURALLY!!
