review/text: I first bought this when i realized spending $20 a month an razor blades for my mach3 was a little bit too much. I was leary about electric razors since i have EXTREMELY sensitive skin. I would recomend this product to anyone. The shave is just as close as a razor, none of that shaving twice a day like other cheaper electrics. The only caution i would give is that Braun says that it may take two weeks for your skin to get used to the razor. This was true for me, so don't be shocked if you are irrated during the first week. For me, that went away after about 10 days.
