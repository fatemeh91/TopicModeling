review/text: I bought the after shave and cologne and like them both and it helps that the smells are synchronized and identical so there isnt an issue of the aftershave clashing with the cologne. I have sensitive skin and I also liked the fact that this is easy on the skin. However the scent is pretty strong on both of them for my taste.
