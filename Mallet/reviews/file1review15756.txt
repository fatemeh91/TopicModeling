review/text: This is a supple combination of superior design, functionality, and sexiness.I was lost in the woods once, and a pack of natives surrounded me. It was obvious to any untrained eye that a white man was a new sight to them. Slowly, they began to surround me.When I realized that I was probably going to be the main course that night, I whipped out my Cross Tech3 Satin Black Multi-Function Pen.They bowed in reverence at its sheen, at its overall durability, at the complete package that it is.Sadly, I had to leave the pen behind. It was a small price to pay for my life. Needless to say, I never leave home without one of these pens.
