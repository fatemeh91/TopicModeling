review/text: I've been using this stuff for about 3 years. It stops the pain almost as soon as it touches you. It takes only a tiny dab and the bottle lasts for a couple of years for me. I gave tons af samples to people and who-ever I give the samples to , they order one for themselves. Sometimes it doesn't work on something , but if it's going to work , it will be instant. I've used it for burns , bursitis , aches + Pains and even across my forehead for headaches to. I got it for my foot pain , but it didn't help , but before I was to send it back , I tried it on my stiff neck and it was better before I even put the lid back on the jar. You won't be sorry.
