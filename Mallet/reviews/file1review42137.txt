review/text: This is the one of the best products I have ever used for my twin boys, who ae now 21 months old. The product is great for cleaning and disinfecting the diaper area as well as for cuts and scrapes anywhere on the body.....it's a great product! My boys have never had a diaper rash and I think it's because i use this product with every diaper change.
