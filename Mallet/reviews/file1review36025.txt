review/text: It's pure L-Arginine it does what the other reviews say it does but the taste of it... well you know things that aren't good for you taste great. Well this stuff is really good for you it helps raise nitric oxide, widen your blood vessels, get rid of plaque buildup that narrows your arteries that makes them stiffer as you get older.. etc.. so yeah it taste like almost the worst thing in the world but thats not Now Foods fault or anyones. Thats how L-Arginine taste and lol how you can tell its the real deal. Trust me you take it with water and you'll never forget how it taste. But the best thing to mix it up with I found out is with Ocean spray cranberry juice or the Cran-apple. Idk why but it makes it taste kind of like ice coffee. Amazon sells both so if your getting this you should pick up some Ocean spray to go with it.
