review/text: I must say I first saw this on the Dr. Oz Show & ordered this along with other supplements from Amazon due to the price and quality of their products. I use this product in conjunction with Raspberry Ketones, & Green Coffee Bean Extract, & exercise. I have noticed that I have lost more inches since adding this into my supplementation regimen. Just be mindful to drink at least 8 ounces of water/fluid with this because it is a dietary fiber & can cause constipation if you do not consume enough liquids. I can actually see the fat in the stool (not to be so graphic), but I can. It also keeps me regular. I will continue to take this supplementation as along as I keep seeing the results. I am a Nurse Practitioner & I have suggested this to many of my patients who desire to lose weight. Just try it and see for yourself. I'm sure you will be pleased.
