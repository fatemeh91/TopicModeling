review/text: so the delivery took a lot longer than needed, but the lighter itself is pretty awesome! the street chrome finish is nice because you dont see finger smudges and doesnt scratch as easy as a regular chrome lighter would. functions like any other zippo lighter, perfectly, is easy to light, and fun to use! would reccomend this kind of lighter if your looking for simplicity or something that wont scratch easy, but wouldnt suggest it if you want it quick
