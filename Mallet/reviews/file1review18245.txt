review/text: I've been using this as a night cream for a couple of years now. I bought it after seeing a special on PBS about the ingredients in it being really great for aging skin. I'm 36 and everyone always says there's no way I look that old...could it be the cream? OR are people just being kind? who knows...but I like it and I like the kiwi-ish smell (and I'm one who is usually averse to most fragrances).UPDATE:I wanted to update my review from 4 years ago. I'm now 40 years old and have used this cream every night. I work at a university and students are often shocked when I say I was a student there 20 years ago, they usually think I'm a student their age. I went on vacation to europe this summer and countless people in their 20's were shocked and refused to believe I was 40. I'd point to my gray hair coming in and one guy accused them of being dyed streaks! I had a 20 yr old who was smitten with me and begging me to take his phone#! I'm now noticing the difference between the quality of my skin and lack of wrinkles to others my age and the beginnings of crows feet and other fine lines starting to appear on people my age. My husband thinks I look better than when I was younger. I can't help but believe this cream is accountable...
