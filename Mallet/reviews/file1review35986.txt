review/text: It used to be easy to find things like this in any grocery store or hardware store: a durable sponge in flexible pieces that move around and are easy to fit into and around any glass or dish. For some reason, over the last 5-6 years, they've all but disappeared, having been replaced by square sponges on handles that don't contact the inside of a glass on all sides, barrel shaped sponges that don't compress very much and can't fit half the time, sponges with scrubber tips that don't contact the glass nearly as well as just - well - a sponge (!), and modern materials that probably last forever but don't hold water and suds very well. This is the only one I've found that matches the good quality I've been used to in the past. The sponges last a long time before they start to fall apart; no complaints there. The handle is sturdy and the sponge doesn't work its way out over time, and somehow these things don't have the tendency to start stinking like many of them do. And they are inexpensive. Let's hope these continue to be available for a long time, although I tend to load up on a few years's worth at a time because good unique products frequently get killed off by the inferior ones!
