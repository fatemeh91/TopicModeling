review/text: Good value. Dissolves well enough as long as you pour the powder into the liquid. Put the liquid into the cup first, then add the powder and stir well. I like using disposable plastic cups because this stuff is hard to clean off of regular plastic cups. Real glasses are fine if you soak them after use, then wash them later.
