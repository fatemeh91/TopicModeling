review/text: I have had chronic dull pain in my left knee for years, partly because of a old basketball injury, partly because of being over-weight, which puts pressure on one's knees and back.I have taken other products for this same problem and they worked somewhat (such as SAM-e); but this product works the best.Like it says on the box, give it 7 days to start working- it takes time to "get into your system". You will notice a DEFINITE difference after 10 days. I did- after about the 10th day, 70% of the pain was gone, and the knee felt more flexible, (much like when you oil a rusty hinge of a door). A knee is basically a hinge which connects your feet and legs. I am now able to do more exercise, more walking, and be more active, which is great.Easy to use: takes two pills per day- that's it. I usually take 2 pills first thing in the morning. The price is reasonable, considering the benefit it gives you.**HIGHLY RECOMMENDED**
