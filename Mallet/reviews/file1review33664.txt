review/text: I found the Water Pik to work just fine. I had used one maybe 15 years ago and had switched to dental floss and an Oral B oscillating toothbrush. My back tooth had shown some gum separation as reported by my dentist. So I added the Water Pik to my regimen (additional 2 minutes or so) and find that it has tightened my gums such that some initial bleeding stopped after about 5 applications. The Water Pik seems just as reliable to me as the one I used many years ago and while there is some extra water that needs to be wiped away at the edge of the sink, this is far from messy and, I believe, well worth adding for improved protection against gum problems.
