review/text: Bizarre, right? I know what you may be thinking: "APRICOT. TOOTHPASTE? Gross. Unusual. A bit unsettling, even. Too fruity, and/or "new-age" for my taste. How can it possibly leave my mouth with the slightly painful-in-a-good-way fresh feeling of clean that my usual big name brand does?!!" I'll admit, the idea of a non-minty or cinnamon-y toothpaste, in general, is weird. I had these thoughts as well. Yet, since I had enjoyed most of Tom's minty-flavored products, I decided to abandon all pre-conceptions and give this apricot concoction a chance. And, oh man, am I glad. Its so great. I love this stuff. It genuinely tastes like real apricots, but not in an overwhelming or fakey-sweet, "blue-raspberry" slurpee kind of way. It doesnt make one think of food at all (i hate that). Its not minty, but after brushing with this toothpaste my teeth felt clean and fresh and healthier than they ever have with the mint stuff. And WITHOUT the scary burning sensation. My mouth felt balanced again, with just the right amount of saliva-- I wasn't parched, I wasn't drooling-- it was just right. Like that baby bear's porridge. or whatever... Anyway, what I'm trying to say is that if there are such things as soul mates, I've found mine in Tom's Apricot toothpaste. I encourage you adventurous folk, or anyone in need of a new toothpaste taste sensation, to try it! (Oh, and I never noticed any "chalky aftertaste" problem from toothpaste... that other reviewer might want to seriously consider getting that checked out. Or remember to spit OUT the toothpaste when finished brushing. Hope it works out for them anyway...)So, in closing, I say thank you, Tom's.
