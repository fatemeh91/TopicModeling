review/text: I just got my support stockings yesterday. I have worn Jobst for years. Their the best support stockings period. I actually started getting varicosities when I was fifteen. Both sides of my family had vein problems. I never had surgery. I rely on these stockings for keeping the swelling down and making life a little more bearable. I highly recommend Jobst ultrasheer. These stockings are not inexpensive,Their the work horse of support stockings.These stockings are also attractive look good on your legs. I bought a cheaper pair of Jobst the econo line. There not econo there is no support. I waisted money buying them, I love the ultrasheer stockings. I have ordered two more pair.I received my stockings within three days from E Medical Supplies. They have great customer service if you have any questions you can E-mail them, they respond quickly. E Medical supplies ships fast!!!! THANKS!!!E Medical Supplies has good prices for Jobst ultrasheer.
