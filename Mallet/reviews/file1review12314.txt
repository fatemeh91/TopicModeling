review/text: I heard about this thing at a BBQ about a month ago. I thought it sounded crazy but this woman said it really stopped her from itching and I am one of those people that itches a lot... well I have not had to itch all summer and it is the end of July :) - it gets kind of hot and feels like a little pinch but it is quick and stops quickly.
