review/text: This is great for normal washing of bottles but it's not quite stiff enough to use if things are stuck on the bottle. Of course typically you shouldn't have things stuck on your water bottles. I often use mine for orange juice though and I like my orange juice to be darn near chewable. If I don't rinse it right after I empty it then I get the pulp stuck on the side of the bottle. I was hoping this would help me scrape that off but it really isn't tough enough to do that.Really good for general cleaning though. Works a lot better than my previous method of putting in soap and water then shaking the bottle.
