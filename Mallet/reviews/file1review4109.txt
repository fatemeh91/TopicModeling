review/text: I bought this as a gag gift and the recipients LOVED it. We couldn't stop laughing. The apron could really be used, it's durable canvas like material. It's not small but definitely wouldn't fit a big guy either. The price for the quality is a little high, but it was worth the laugh. A little splurge for a gift is okay in my opinion :)
