review/text: I had a huge wart at the bottom of my big toe a few months ago. I used a brand that says PAINLESSLY REMOVES ... apparently it was painless for the wart, bec. it was so painful for me when the wart swelled to 3x its size and some form of liquid inside. A few more days of pain then the swelling started to subside and wart came off... BUT WAIT... its not done... after a couple of months, I noticed more warts growing... like 7~9 more smaller ones at about the same area.I ordered this last week, didnt start using till 2 days ago... and I was surprised after 1 application, the smaller ones just peeled off in the shower and the bigger ones are not looking as tough and seems about to fall off in another couple of application.Now any suggestions how I can keep them off me?PediFix Wart STICK
