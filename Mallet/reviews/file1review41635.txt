review/text: My periodontist recommended this electric toothbrush and, after doing much Internet research, I bought it at Amazon, which had the best price. This is not my first electric toothbrush. Until it died, I had a Braun for years. This is much more efficient in massaging the gums and getting between teeth. Following directions and brushing for two minutes is made easier by the pulse that alerts you to a 30-second interval, followed by a smiley face after two minutes. I can feel the different in my gums and that's the point. Simply put: highly recommended.
