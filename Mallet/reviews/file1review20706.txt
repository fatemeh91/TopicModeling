review/text: I believe Braun has changed the way they make the new replacement cutters and foil heads for the 8000 series razors. The older ones had grey plastic clips on the ends and the new ones have black. I have purchased three new sets in four months and all three have lost a clip off of the end. This causes the foils to vibrate. It is a very noticable change in the sound when turned on and the quality of shave is greatly reduced. I have used this razor for three years and never had this problem. I used the last replacement head two times before it broke.
