review/text: I have used this product as an energy booster and for a healthy living for several years during on and off periods, and have felt great. I love the flavor especially of the Cookies & Cream and Capuccino, but vanilla and cocoa are very good too. This summer I used if to loose weight after childbirth and lost almost 10 pounds without much effort, also accompanied by the protein (formula 3), multivitamin complex and Fiber&Herbs; (Salvado y Hierbas in Spanish). Everyone told me I was looking great on the beach!I am a fan of all herbalife products in general and have studied in depth the compnay's history, philosophy, products, etc. They are natural and scientifically created and tested by a honored team of MD and scientists of UCLA, one of them Nobel prize winner (Dr. Louis Ignarro). So to the guy that had an issue with soy protein and thought Herbalife was stuck in the 80`,- that`s not the case dude.I want to clarify that I am not a Herbalife seller neither part of their Multilevel Marketing scheme. I`ve just had the chance to try their products and have loved them, their cosmentic products as well. Such a pitty that in Europe they are far more expensive that in the USA!
