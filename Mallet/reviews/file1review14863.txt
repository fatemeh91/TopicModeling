review/text: Just started working out seriously 4 weeks ago. Now that I'm on a schedule, I decided to concentrate on my diet. I've been incorporating these in my diet plan. I have one right after the gym in the morning. It tastes great; far better than any other protein powders I've had before. The protein content is high and the shake provides plenty of nutrients. At first, I was afraid of the taste and added vanilla extract, but it wasn't necessary. I started adding very small amounts of a combination of frozen fruits (peaches, strawberries, bananas or blueberries), frozen spinach, walnuts and carrots to add to the flavor profile, the nutrient factor and also for ruffage. I no longer need to add ice cubes and the combination of flavors is fantastic. It takes me a good 20 minutes to drink the entire thing. Very filling. I could have 3 or 4 of these a day but I enjoy real food, too. The beauty about these shakes is you can have them at anytime of the day and even before bed. It's the perfect meal. Don't go overboard adding things to the shake and make sure you have a good blender. Can't find frozen fruits? Buy them fresh, chop them up in portions and freeze them. They'll last forever. Haven't tried the other flavors, but vanilla mixes well with anything.
