review/text: I bought this sheet protector for our bed since I am co-sleeping with my baby and do not want any leaks onto the matress. I actually put it underneath the sheet and I haven't had any issue with it moving. It does get pretty crumpled up when it is in the dryer, so it takes a little effort to flatten it out, but it really isn't issue enough to look for another option. Overall, I am really happy with this product!
