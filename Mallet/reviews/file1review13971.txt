review/text: when it arrived, it arrived in a shipping bubbled bag and thats it, nothing else.. wasn't too happy about that but whatever. They are very big so what I recommend doing is boiling some water and dipping them in, For two reasons , one to sanitize them and two, to mold your teeth. I dipped them in the boiling water , waited a few seconds and stuck them in my mouth to start molding,(you can redip till you have your desired mold).Once I had my desired mold, (wasnt perfect but it was the closest I could get them), I ran them under cold water to lock in the mold. when I used them it was okay, nothing really major, thy're still alittle big so its alittle hard keeping them stuck on your teeth. They are okay for beginners and for someone just looking for some cheap molds but if you whiten your teeth alot, I suggest getting some better ones, not these.
