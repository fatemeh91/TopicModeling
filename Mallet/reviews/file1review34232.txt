review/text: The best way for me to describe this Medication is... It's like sitting on an Ice Cube, plain and simple. The only draw back is I personally feel that it does nothing to cure the problem what so ever. But just relieves the discomfort. But does a hell of a Job in doing so. The best Product out there of its kind. So if your out to do just that and relieve yourself without expecting some miracle cure to happen. Then this stuff is for you.
