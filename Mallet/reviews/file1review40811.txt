review/text: Arrived exactly as pictured&#8212;same package, color, and cartridge. Very pleased as I'm a longtime Intuition user and I'm glad I could still find one! Schick has stopped making these, but I dislike the new handles that do not come with a hole at the end for hanging on a shower caddy hook&#8212;I'm sorry, but the plastic thing that comes with the new ones to &#34;hang&#34; it up via suction cup on the shower wall is a pathetic excuse for a holder.
