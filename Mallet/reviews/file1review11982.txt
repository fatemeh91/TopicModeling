review/text: This is the only vitamin my wife likes. She said it never made her nauseous even if she didn't eat when she took it. She said it was very gentle on her stomach and she didn't want to think what it would be like being pregnant without it. It is a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for. This is definitely something to splurge on. Your little one deserves the best. Even though they are large, she said they were quite easy to swallow and didn't hurt her throat.
