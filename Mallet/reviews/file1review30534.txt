review/text: This is a great product! I have sensitive skin - other deodorants made me breakout with a rash and the deodorants with aluminum left light colored shirts with yellow stains. When first using this product, it didnt seem to work well, but what else could I do, it was better than getting these breakouts under my arms- I gave it a good two week trial and wow! this stuf really worked. No more breakouts and even after getting off the treadmill, running 3-4 miles, it was still working. This product is hard to find in stores - in the San Jose area - thanks to Amazon.con I can get it when I want it. If you have eczema or sensitive skin, this is the deodorant to buy.
