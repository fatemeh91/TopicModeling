review/text: This came right on time & works awesome! It's comes with an easy carry case to slip in the purse. You have to wait 10 minutes after eating or drinking to do the test. And it has 500 tests before the sensor needs to be replaced. That takes a long time! Even at parties! Definitely buy more mouthpieces, though.
