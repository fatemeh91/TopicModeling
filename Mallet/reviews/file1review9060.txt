review/text: I am a very healthy person as it is. I exercise regularly and adhere to a very strict diet. I purchased Green Vibrance hoping to enhance my overall health and was also hoping for a little extra energy as well. After I finished my first 30 day supply of it, I hadn't really noticed any changes in my health or my energy level. Since the stuff was so expensive, I decided not to repurchase it. A few days later, I noticed that my endurance in the gym had dropped and my overall mood throughout the day was terrible. Since Green Vibrance was the only thing that I had changed, I decided to order another tub and immediately started feeling better once I began taking it again. Just to be sure this wasn't a fluke, I had this tested another time that I ran out of product before I could reorder and felt the same decline in mood and endurance until it arrived to me. This stuff won't magically make you into a ball of energy or instantly make you healthy, but over time this product will contribute positively to your health and mood. I will continue to be a loyal customer, it is worth the money.
