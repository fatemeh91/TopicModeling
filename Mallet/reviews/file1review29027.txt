review/text: I usually shave with my Mach 3 razor. I decided to buy the Braun Cruzer 3, and got it home, and tried to shave with it. After going over the same area of beard like 10 times, I realized that there was still stubble. This thing just doesn't cut, and I don't want to stand there for 15 minutes, trying to get a close shave from it. I am sorry I bought this. It is a waste of money. Get a Mach 3 instead, and a beard razor, like the ones Panasonic makes.
