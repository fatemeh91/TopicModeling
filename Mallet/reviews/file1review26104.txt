review/text: I've only been smoke-free for 5 days, but these have been a help, both for having something to focus on orally, and for the taste. The cinnamon is a lot stronger than I expected but it lasts really long. The original flavor one is a little weird but a decent mix with the cinnamon.The only bad thing I have to say about these is that I was surprised by how they splintered. A friend that recommended them to me raved about how he could chew on them all day, 8+ hours. I must have stronger teeth. I subconsciously bite really hard on them occasionally, and can't get them to last more than an hour or two w/o splintering.Overall, really really happy with them. Wish I would've ordered more - the shipping was almost half the tab.
