review/text: I started using two scoops a day of profibe around 2005. One morning in 2007 when I looked in the mirror I noticedthe extensive fatty deposits on my eyelids, which began 25 years earlier, had disappeared. (They were called xanthelasma) I checked the medical literature. The regression of xanthelasma in a single patient, apparently due to a cholesterol lowerng drug, was the subject of a medical journal report. This supplement acts on cholesterol deposits in a unique and apparently not fully understood manner. It goes beyond simply lowering b lood cholesterol.
