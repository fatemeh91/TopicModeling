review/text: Works great for cleaning coffee tumblers and works pretty effectively on a CPAP reservior. I've also used it on my 1L Nalgene bottle and it cleaned it very well. Its next test will be my 3L CamelBak reservoir. I found if I quickly roll the handle quickly between my hands with the brush head in the empty sink basin (to catch the spray), it dries very fast.
