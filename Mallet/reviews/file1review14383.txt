review/text: I first saw this product at a "Green fair." It does a very good job cleaning floors, including spills and scuff marks (when paired with the Bona microfiber cleaning cloth.BonaKemi AX0003005 Microfiber Floor Cleaning Cloth, Twin Pack). It also drys fairly quickly and does not have the harsh smell that other cleaners have. The only drawback is the need to spray either the floor or the mop head repeatedly as you go through the room. I believe Bona remedied this issue with their new product line.
