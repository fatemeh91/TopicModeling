review/text: This is some of the best tasting protein powder there is. I'd like to vouch for its effectiveness, but how does one really know when you are supplementing it with other diet and exercise. Nevertheless, this is a quality tasting product though not as good as the double rich chocolate IMO. I'll be getting ON whey for a while into the future I am sure, after it replaced my ProtaQuest (also very very tasty) which got a little on the expensive side.
