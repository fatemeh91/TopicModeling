review/text: I shaved with cheap shaving cream or gel with no pre-shave oil or after shave balm for 35 years. I thought all that was a waste of money. Was I ever wrong. I started using &#34;The Art of Shaving&#34; products about a year ago after my daughter gave me a free shave at a local Art of Shaving store. I truthfully was not very excited about it; but I liked so much I bought the whole line of products before I left and they feel great on my face. I really like the after-shave balm.
