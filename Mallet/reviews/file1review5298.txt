review/text: We love Gin-Gins! We eat them all the time. It took a while for my kids to like them but now they love them. They work great for my daughter's motion sickness. She is good at getting that in the car and has pretty much "broke in" every vehicle we have had. Took them with us on our trip to Colorado and guess what? No upset stomachs from the curvy roads! I don't consider the ginger ale you buy at Walmart real ginger. If you want real ginger eat Gin-Gins!
