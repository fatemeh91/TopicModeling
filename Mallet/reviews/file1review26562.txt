review/text: I bought a Back Booster about six weeks ago. Inflated slightly and installed in car. After adjusting amount of air for comfort while driving, I used it for two or three weeks. Then the air went out, the booster lost its boost. Blew more air in the next time I drove and it lasted two days before deflating again. Apparently the valve leaks. Not repairable, it appears.
