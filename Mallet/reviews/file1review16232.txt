review/text: I received my package this afternoon and after reading the reviews here of people not getting the 100 promised and having almost expired condoms, I decided to count and check the expiration dates. The expiration dates are fine most expire in 2014 with some expiring in 2015. But I did not receive the promised 100. I only received 88! The variety is OKAY. I got 6 different kinds. All in all, I am happy with the purchase but who ever is responsible for packaging needs to make sure that whatever amount is promised is packaged.
