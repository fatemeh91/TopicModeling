review/text: This adult version of liquid Tylenol has a cool sensation when you take it, that calms sore throats. Even if your cold or flu doesn't result in a painful throat, the cool feeling of this medicine gives some relief to the uncomfortable hot feeling your face and sinuses feel when they are stuffed up. The included dosage cup gives you two measurements, one for the dose you would normally find in 1 Tylenol pill, and the second dose (a full cup) is the dosage for what would normally be two Tylenol pills. One bottle of this does not however, equal the same number of doses you would find in a typical bottle of Tylenol pills. What would normally equal two pills, is 30ML of this liquid version. There are 8 ounces of Tylenol in this bottle. 8 ounces equals about 236ML. So if a typical two pill dose equals 30ML, there are about 7.8 two Tylenol pill doses in this bottle.
