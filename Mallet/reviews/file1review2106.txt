review/text: For some reason Dip-it has become hard to find lately. At least in my rural area. NOTHING works better toremove those hard to get at/nasty coffee stains in the bottom of a metal thermos. I have a coffee carafewith a metal lining and this stuff works fast and clears out everything. You simply cannot beat it for removingstains.
