review/text: I am an EMT and retired Hospital Administrator.Like the first reviewer I view marketing this without the proper training to be irresponsible.If the person has a Myocardial Infarction, resulting in a true "flat line" ECG a Defibrillator is useless without the proper drugs which have to be given intraveniously or injected directly into the heart to start random heart activity.Only then can a defibrillator shock the heart into proper pumping action.The most important thing a layman can do is learn CPR. If you can keep OXYGEN going into the lungs and then circulate that oxygen to the brain and heart (PUMPING) you have done the ONLY really important thing. If people use this for a Myocardial Infarction, INSTEAD of IMMEDIATELY starting effective CPR, the TIME Philips causes them to waste deprives the brain of oxygen and dooms the patient.I've defibed scores of patients but NEVER successfully unless two people had already done CPR until we could get the drugs injected first.The gentleman with the implanted device does not have a Myocardial Infarction ...just an electrical arrythmia which the little battery in his device can sense and "retime" the heart....thats a whole different thing.For an MI learn to do CPR properly. If you can get oxygen to the brain you can keep the person in a salvagable state until properly trained persons with ALL the tools, heart stimulants, bicarbonate to return the blood to it's proper Ph etc can arrive and the defibrillation have a chance of working.Phillips can market this thing only because it has a computer which keeps it from working when it shouldn't so the FDA figured it's harmless. BUT IF IT WASTES TIME in starting CPR, it's NOT harmless.Buy the RED CROSS First Aid Manual
