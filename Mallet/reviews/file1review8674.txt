review/text: light, small and narrow head and with a heavy handle. A bit off balance for use around kitchen. As the handle is too heavy, you loose the feeling of connection with the broom head, compounded with a small and narrow head, I have a difficult time picking up things from the floor. Not as expected from read the reviews. In comparison, my old one from local home improvement store is much easier to handle and faster in cleaning the floor. I realized that it had a wider head and lighter handle which you can use by one hand and have a great connection with the floor. It is almost parallel with the feeling on the steering wheel in cars. To me, the OXO is more expensive but hard to use. It is solid build but not ideal around kitchen or inside of the house. in fact, I am not sure where it would be an ideal use with the rather limit head. I am 5' 10", male.
