review/text: Having been on a diet over the last nine weeks and after being weighed weekly at the clinic I was using, I decided that I needed an accurate scale. It became obvious that it was an absolute necessity to continue the diet and to control my weight. My previous experience has been with standard bathroom scales either electronic or spring. They all have their limitations from being downright inaccurate to a pain to keep in batteries. Since my doctor had been weighing me on a balance beam scale and that the scale could accurately measure within a quarter pound I decided that was what I needed. After doing some research and just happening on a How It's Made program featuring a Detecto 437 I came to Amazon and purchased one. It came as a complete suprise to me that a balance beam scale was very reasonable priced for what you get. The assembly was a breese and the calibration was fast and easy. When I stepped on the scale it was within a half pound of the scale I had been on at the doctor's the previous day. I was sold! If you need an accurate and reliable sale look no further than the 437. And it is made in the USA!
