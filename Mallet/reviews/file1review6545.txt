review/text: I have always had neck and shoulder tension issues. I got interested in trigger point massage therapy, and it had been working very well for me. Let me tell you, it is SO much easier to complete the trigger point massage with this tool. I used to have to contort around and give myself a pretty hearty arm workout by the end. But when I use this product, trigger point massage is exponentially easier. And because the angles mean I don't have to work as hard with my arms, I can do the massage more quickly and with better quality than I ever could before.Though I can't speak to the usefulness of this product in comparison to others of its kind, I think that anyone would be pleased with this item if they are interested in trigger point massage. It is some of the best money that I have spent!
