review/text: I had been taking timed release B12 tablets, but eventually they were bothering my stomach. The spray solved that problem and has no negatives of its own. Works great.My B12 level was 213 and my doctor said they usually begin treatment when it is 400. My next test was about one month after I started using the spray and my level was up to 1150. My doctor said she had never seen a B12 level rise so far so fast.
