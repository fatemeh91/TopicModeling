review/text: I developed an allergy to chemical sunscreens and had to look for a new SPF lip balm. This stuff works just as well as old stuff I was using which is saying a lot for something that uses zinc/titanium oxide for sun protection. This stuff goes on easy and does not leave any white cast on your lips.
