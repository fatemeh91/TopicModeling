review/text: In my quest to build my own 'perfect' survival kit, I've bought about 8 or 10 commercial kits and looked through every other one I could find for ideas and, sometimes, components. Most kits are very poorly thought out and equipped even worse. Every kit I've bought or looked through has had obvious weak points: cheep components, missing necessities or poorly thought out combinations of items (weighing down the pack with too much food and not enough water procurement or supplying several fire making components and no shelter components).The AMK Pocket Survival Pak is the first personal survival kit that I've been truly impressed with. All of the components are well thought out and of high quality. The Spark-Lite Firestarter is top-notch. The Fox-40 Survival whistle is top-notch. The Rescue Flash Signaling Mirror is top-notch. Any of these three items would be first or second choice when building your own kit (all three were first choice for me). The rest of the kit is of quality general components, many of which will be making their way into my normal, larger kit. But, the beauty of this kit is its size. It fits the most important survival gear into a tiny (less than 4 oz), water-proof bag that easily fits into a shirt pocket, fanny pack, purse or glove compartment.There are only three things I would add to this kit: a Leatherman Micra, a Bic lighter and a survival blanket. I already carried the Micra and lighter with me and a survival blanket or plastic poncho is easily added.Of all of the kits I've bought or examined, this is the first one I would recommend and the only one of which I'll be buying more than one of; I'm buying three more of them so I can keep one in my truck, hiking kit and home and this one will supplement my larger pack.Doug Ritter, the designer of this kit, also has a great site ([..]) with reviews of several other kits, if you want to see what they come with or just want to read reviews on survival gear in general.
