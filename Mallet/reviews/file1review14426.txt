review/text: I thought I would try Motion Eaze since it was all natural, and doesn't interact with other meds. It took the edge off for me. I didn't actually have to throw up, though I felt as if I would. It was so-so for the general bus ride, UNTIL the bus started making sudden stops like in NYC traffic, and at the tolls. Then I'm sure I turned green, started sweating, had to blow cold air on me. So it probably helps those that have a mild motion sickness problem. If I were you, I would bring along the Bonine/Dramamine just in case. Wish I had!
