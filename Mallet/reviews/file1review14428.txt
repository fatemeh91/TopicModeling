review/text: I tried this on my 17 month old daughter who gets carsick even with short trips. The good was that she didn't throw up, but she was still was not comfortable and was complaining during the whole car ride. After a short stop, she was reluctant to get back in the car.Edit: After increasing the dosage to 2 drops per ear it now seems to work good with my daughter! No more vomiting and no more complaints when she rides the car!
