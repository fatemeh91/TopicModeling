review/text: Having an elderly mom who is wheelchair bound, this product is very handy, for she likes to carry tissue, reading glasses and other things with her as she "travels". This keeps her necessities at an easy access and keeps her hands and lap free! I highly recommend this for anyone in a wheelchair, and the price is very affordable, too.
