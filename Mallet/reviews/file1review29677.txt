review/text: I purchased a couple different kinds of reusable nursing pads because I just couldn't bring myself to constantly line my bras with disposables which, to me, seem like jamming pantyliners into your bra. I like these the best because:1. They maintain their shape after washing. No strange edges/shapes after being in the dryer.2. Thickness - I found that the thin pads did nothing to contain my leaking. These pads absorbed well - even when I was soaking through everything else!As others have mentioned, you may see these through your shirt. But, I think that's the case with most pads if you REALLY need them. I have a heavy milk supply, and these have worked best for me.
