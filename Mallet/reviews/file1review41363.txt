review/text: My chiropractor recommended these to me and my goodness he was right! I had bought, it seems, every Shoe insert known to man and threw them all out one by one. These are the best! Not only did I buy these 3/4 ones but I had also bought the full size from my chiropractor and they are just as fantastic. The 3/4 come in two styles. One for heels of 1 inch or more and the others for flat heels. I haven't been able to wear heels comfortably until I put these in. I can't say enough good things. One other important thing. If you buy the full size shoe inserts, you must be able to take the shoe's original insert out otherwise it will make the shoe too tight. That's were the 3/4 flat insert will do the trick. As I said, I have all three styles and just interchange them with whatever shoe I decide to wear.
