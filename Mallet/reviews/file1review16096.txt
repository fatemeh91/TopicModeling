review/text: My cat was had blood in urine. The vet bill was expensive and they gave him antibiotics. He was still bleeding. They wanted me to spend a couple hundred more dollars just for tests. Instead, I ordered this stuff. It's easier to give the cat the tiny little grains, than a pill or a medicine dropper. And he seems to be doing better, and he gained his lost weight back and seems normal. So, I'm glad I discovered this homeopathic remedy. The vendor sent the medicine as soon as I ordered it. Thanks so much. You may have prolonged my kitty's life. I asked him if he feels better and all he says is "Meow". And I don't speak kitty, so can't tell you what the cat thinks about it.
