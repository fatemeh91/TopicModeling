review/text: I registered for these diapers and was very disappointed. I wish I would have gotten another kind. These have been washed only a few times and not even dryed in the dryer. These have all kinds of pilling and strings coming apart. I don't think these will last very long. Save yourself the money and buy regular burp cloths or another type of diaper.
