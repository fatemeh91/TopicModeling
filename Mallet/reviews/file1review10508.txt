review/text: After taking long and strong antibiotics for mastitis -developed IBS -for lack of a better description that is what I call it. The GI physician said that receptor cells had been damaged... anyway,Tried many things including prescription drugs without success. Fiber Smart was the first product of many that worked for me and reduced dramaticly the sx.s...I believe if one product does not work rather than condeming all...try another with a different combination of probiotics, fiber, etc. Never know what will make a difference.
