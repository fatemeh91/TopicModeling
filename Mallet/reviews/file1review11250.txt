review/text: My friend Lisa, who runs a health food store, gave me some of this product when I was having digestive track problems brought on by a very powerful antibiotic. It brought things back under control. It has to be kept refrigerated, but is handy to have around. You have to take it several hours after the antibiotic, to let the antibiotic clear through your system. Preferably, take it before a meal. Mixed with room temperature water, it has no particular taste (you can also get it in capsule form). It is well worth the price to avoid the usual side effect of an antibiotic.
