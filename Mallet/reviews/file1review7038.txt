review/text: Over the years I have tried many razors but Wahl shaves the closest. The long hair trimmer is much better than most I have used even on more expensive shavers. Another major advantage of this product is the replacement head and cutter is reasonably priced unlike other shavers where the parts can be as expensive as the razor. I had a problem with the first one I received but Amazon replace with no hassle!
