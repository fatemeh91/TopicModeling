review/text: I'm grateful for DIM because it really does take away my hot flashes which helps me to get a better night's sleep. But note that it most likely won't work overnight I suspect for most people. You have to give it a few days to a few weeks to kick in. For me DIM takes about a week and a half to start working again if I stop taking it for a while. I take 2 in the am usually and am happy to report the capsules are small & easy to swallow. Overall good product.
