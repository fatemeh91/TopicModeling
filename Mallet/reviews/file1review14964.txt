review/text: This pill as a regular healthy coffee drinker ( 2 cups day)is kinda like two red bulls..long lasting,but keep inmind,EAT something,it can burn your tummy,its high acid.I also HIGHLY refer you not to take this,if yourANXIETY prone,from anything from PMS to high stress..itcauses some wild bouts of anxiety,so take 1/2 and see howyou like it.its not even close to a coffee buzz..its totallya body buzz...great for work outs,long trips..long nights..oh and what comes up,must come down..head achy,can happen,next day.
