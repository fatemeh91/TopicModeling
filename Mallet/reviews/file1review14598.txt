review/text: After reading an article about melatonin, and how our brains lose melatonin as we age, I decided to try it. The research pointed out that 0.5 mg is as effective as 3 - 5pm, I picked up a bottle of 1 mg Melatonin by Source Naturals at my local health food store. I have been splitting the tablets in half and taking it about an hour before bedtime. The first time I slept so well that I woke up in the same position I fell asleep in...no pillows thrown about, no covers tossed aside. The bed was still perfectly made and I awoke lying on my back, ten hours later. Amazing. Since then I have been taking the same dose every night with results not quite as stunning as that, but it does seem to help get me into a more ready to fall asleep mode.
