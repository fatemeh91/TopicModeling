review/text: I had bought the plastic straws & lids that come with the tall insulated drink glasses. Those straws did not hold up very well so I went on line to find some disposable drinking straws for tall plastic cups and I found these. I love them. They are perfect for the tall plastic insulated glasses with the plastic tops. You can even extend the flexible part into different shapes which my children love. These straws were exactly what I was looking for.
