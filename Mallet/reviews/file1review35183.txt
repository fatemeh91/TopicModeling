review/text: I have had diabetes for 30 years. Sometimes I need a quick snack when I am working, on the street or I don't have time to stop in a caffe or store to buy it. Or I can't take lunch box to carry food. So those Bars are an ideal option to have a snack. Delicious and practical. You don't need too much space and get the carbs you just need. I can find milkshake powder or milkshake cans in my country. But sometimes those beverages are hot when you are going to drink it.So this bars are a VERY good option for people like me. The delivery was on time and the packages were in perfect condition
