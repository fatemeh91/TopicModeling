review/text: I bought the Bissell Swift Sweep because I was looking for an inexpensive way to do light cleaning on my outdoor carpeting without having to lug a heavy vacuum to the back porch. This sweeper does the job adequately. It doesn't pick up every last particle, but it picks up a fair amount and keeps the dirt and debris under control (I have two young children who play outside frequently, leaving behind sequins and other craft items, along with sand, sticks, grass, etc.). As an added plus, I can bring it inside to quickly sweep up large items from my tile floors and rugs (bits of playdough, flower petals, cheerios). It doesn't replace my broom and dustpan or my vacuum cleaner, but it does supplement them nicely. The included brush comb clips to the handle, which is a nice touch. The dustpans are large and easy to empty.
