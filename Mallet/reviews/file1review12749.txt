review/text: I hadnt bought splints for a couple years, and at that time got a group price on several items , so i was surprised to find that sam splints cost 17$ or more. i found these for under 10, so i bought four. the metal seems to be jsut right for splinting, very ductile. It's a little thinner than SAM's, but if you're going to wrap with vet tape or gaize, it will immobolize well enough. i tried to fatigue it by bending it 10 times in exactly the same place, and it held up fine. great splint.
