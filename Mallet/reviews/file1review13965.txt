review/text: The easiest and the most efficient (cheapest and no timer) way to mold your own whitening trays. Included instruction says it all, warm it up and mold it to perfection as many time as you wish unless they really fit. I even did some readjustment after couple days of using them. You don't have to cut these front tiny pieces-tags - it works more comfortable while putting trays in and out of your mouth.Along with 5min whitening solution they work just perfectly.:D big smile so you can see all my white teeth
