review/text: I ordered these from a different site years ago (2008). Since I have issues with spontaneous anxiety, I wanted to avoid taking the noortropic pill. I called the company (Universal) and they refused to tell me which pill was the noortropic pill so I could avoid it. They said that since their formula is proprietary, they can't tell which pill is which except for the caffeine. I tried one pack but the not-knowing bugged (and frankly scared) me to the point where I sent it back. If you have the ingredients listed on the can (which they do) I don't see what the secret is in telling paying customers which pill performs which function. For that reason, I will not ever buy another product from this company.
