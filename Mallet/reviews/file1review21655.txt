review/text: This item was the perfect thing for my 5-month old daughter who is large for her size and was not yet fully sitting up at the time. She had already outgrown the infant tub and I could no longer bathe her at the sink because she was too long for the counter! So I bought the Snug Tub for use in the big bath downstairs. It really is great because if they fall against it there are no bumped heads. You do have to watch them to keep them from falling to the side towards the wall though, but it's not hard.My only complaint was that the bottom of the tub was slippery for someone who could not yet fully sit up without support, and a couple of times she slipped down and it scared her. I was holding her so she did not go underwater, but her bottom slipped out from underneath her and it was a little startling. In some of the pictures for this item, they show a baby leaning back getting his hair washed. To lean her back, it required me to use both hands to keep her from slipping under, so I was unable to wash her hair. (Hubby is not always around at bath time!)So I purchased a yellow spongy foam bear-shaped pad at Babies R Us that fits nicely inside the bottom of the tub. Now she can play with her toys and there is no slipping. Also I can easily lean her back to wash her hair and rinse and she is not scared, and the soap doesn't get in her eyes. (I tried washcloths and towels before I bought the foam thing but it just wasn't the same. Although you could probably use a big bath towel in the bottom, but it would be a hassle to wash it every time - the foam thing just squeezes out and hangs dry) So - it's a great tub, and much more comfortable than a hard plastic swivel seat, but just make sure you get something for the bottom of it!
