review/text: We've used the Sonic Complete System since last summer and have found it made a significant difference from manual toothbrushes - the heads do a great job in dislodging small particles and also seem to help in brightening the teeth. Oral B recommends replacing every 3 months - we think it can safely stretch to 4-5 months, particularly since the heads are somewhat expensive compared to manual toothbrushes with regular replacement.
