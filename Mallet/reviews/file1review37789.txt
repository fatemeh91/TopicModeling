review/text: I cannot eat soybean oil or other soy products. I reviewed several online products, and this one did not mention soybean in the ingredients at least that I saw. But in fact, when it arrived and I read all of the ingredients it did in fact contain soybean. So I had to mail it back. I wish I could obtain a CoQ10 product without soybean.Pat Gladden
