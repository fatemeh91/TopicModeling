review/text: I had tried a cheaper product, but it just didn't work as well as Natural Factors. I need a diuretic to help me with my blood pressure and pain and swelling in my foot and ankle, and this works great. I can see and feel the difference with this product. I won't be trying any others. I'll stick with this because it works!
