review/text: This lift permitted my wife to come home from a nursing home, but is less than ideal. A major problem is related to the lack of use of her arms due to a serious stroke. The lift is designed ideally for someone who can grab the lift bars with both hands to reduce stress and strain on underarms. Without this ability, much of her weight (perhaps 60% or 70%) is suspended by her arm pits. This is uncomfortable and leads to her arms being dramatically splayed out, threatening to rip her arms out of her shoulder sockets. I developed a 6' Velcro strap that holds her elbows in at her side to avoid the most serious discomfort, but even with the strap the sling rides up toward her neck, causing significant discomfort roughly half the time.The other problem with the Reliant 350 is the quality of construction, which is the major reason for not giving the lift 4 stars. We have owned the lift for about 2 and a half years. In that time both major locking casters have failed twice, the lift actuator (drive motor) has failed once, and the up/down remote switch has failed twice. Repairs have cost us about $1,500. And we have been seriously inconvenienced by a couple of these failures. We have used the RPS 350-1 as a rental loaner, and it is essentially the same as the one we own.We have tried the Liko Sabina 2 lift. It seems better made, but it has the same problem related to lack of arm capability, even with their comfort sling, and it is more expensive. A hoyer lift is more comfortable, but transferring and toileting at home is much more of a problem with this lift.Our bottom line: It's better than being in a nursing home.
