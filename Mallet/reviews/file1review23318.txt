review/text: I read the reviews on this product and decided to take the chance. I agree it works great but the handle is defective. For the price I didn't mind spending the extra time to tape it together. All that matters is that it works right?I work with a Podiatrist and I needed something to pick up the toenails off the floor. The sweeper picks the nails up well enough for me to be pleased, but it does take several passes in order for this to happen. The best part is it doesn't run on electricity, so there's no worry of batteries dying or any obnoxious noises. I tried it out at home first picking up wood splinters from around the fireplace. I just might buy a second one for the house too!So to sum up, the product works well, but that handle is down right awful...I couldn't lift it up without it falling to pieces. God only knows why they didn't either taper the ends or have them screw in. This is what stops it from having 5 stars!It is definitely worth the money and I highly recommend it
