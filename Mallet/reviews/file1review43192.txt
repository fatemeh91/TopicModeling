review/text: I've always been a fan of the daily shower sprays as I am too lazy to do a regular deep cleaning. :)This product does a great job and has an "OK" scent. Other reviewers have linked the scent to a baby lotion or powder and that is the best description I can come up with as well. It's not overwhelmingly "baby", but definitely more than a hint. Overall I've been very pleased with the quality and would recommend it.
