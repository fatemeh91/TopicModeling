review/text: I decided to take these as my prenatal vitamin for the duration of my pregnancy. I've almost finished my first 150 count bottle and plan to order another. In terms of cost, this product delivers a lot more than other products of a similar price-range. And, unlike a lot of other vitamins, you only need to take one a day. This was the biggest appeal for me since I have problems remembering to take one pill, much less two or three a day. The only reason I rate this product at four stars instead of five is because while they claim that the pills are easy on your stomach, the details of their labling clearly state that you need to take these pills with food. The only time I vomited during my whole first trimester was because I took one of these pills on an empty stomach. Otherwise I've been very happy with their performance and have found that they dont exacerbate my heartburn.
