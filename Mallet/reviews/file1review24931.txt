review/text: ok so about 12 days ago i started taking fertilaid and immediately i felt energized and ready to go and a little more healthy. the downside is at the same time it gave me the jitters and made me so jumpy i couldnt stand to sit still....then about two days into taking it i started getting headaches at night...and my stomache started hurting whenever i wouldnt eat...i would love to think that these are symptoms of a possible pregnancy because i am almost two weeks late at this point. however i tested and got a big fat negative so far. i think the side effects were due to starting immediately with the entire daily dose of three pills. i have not used it for two days and i think i am going to go ahead and continue the bottle since apparently i am not pregnant yet. i'll give it until the end of the bottle because even though the symptoms are annoying they are bearable...it forced me to make time for split up meals during the day to feel less nauseus and i would take advil to ease the headaches if they would get unbearable when it got that bad ( which it normally didn't). so so far no bfp and to reaccount my case me and my fiance have been ttc for over a year and a half with no birth control with one possible but not confirmed miscarriage in that time period. i have very irregular periods and i dont always ovulate. i am going to continue taking it like i said until the bottle runs out or i get a positive test. either way i'll let people know on here
