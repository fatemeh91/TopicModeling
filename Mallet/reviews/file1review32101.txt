review/text: I really wanted this product to work, especially based on the Kelly Ripa advertisements that made it look so simple and effective. Alas, I have tried it on very small Ketchup spots, very small tomato-based soup spatters, and finally, today, I tried to remove stains from a Starbucks Green Tea Frappuchino. I have to say I am disappointed in the results. In each case it did lighten the stain significantly, but in none of these cases did it work "as advertised". That is to say, it did not leave my blouse looking like new. It left a still-quite-visible spot each time.On each occasion, I was wearing either 100% cotton or a cotton/synthetic blend fabric, if that might make a difference.I will say, at least it didn't make things worse. After pretreating and washing all three spills were completely gone.I will continue using my Tide To Go pen when these little accidents happen, and maybe I will eventually spill something on myself that it does work on; but at this point I seriously doubt that I will purchase another.
