review/text: These seem great - I have not seen or used the more expensive brand name, but these look good for the price. Instead of rolled, I flattened and folded once and it fits in my pack much better than a roll. Today I am hiking with teenagers who like to rock scramble by the river, with any luck one will sprain or break something and I can try the split out. (just kidding)When hiking by myself with hiking poles I do not bring as large a med kit so this stays home, but every full stock med kit should have one of these.There are also probably a million good uses for these that are not medically related to repair or support some aspect of broken camping equipment.
