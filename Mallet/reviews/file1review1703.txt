review/text: My son is on the wrestling team. Since joining the team we have been at constant battle with ringworm and staph infections, so called 'grappling' illnesses. Anyway, after doing some research we decided to try this product. Funga Soap is packaged well and the price is reasonable, after receiving it and looking at the ingredients I was impressed. It being a new product, I tried it on myself first. I had no adverse reactions to this product however,my son broke out and his skin itched badly. Also the smell of the product is really bad. In conclusion, I think this product would probably work fine if your skin can handle it. But the only way to know if your skin can handle it is to buy it. Because we had such mixed results, I don't know if my review is helpful.
