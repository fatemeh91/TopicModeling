review/text: great product if you are into workouts and building muscle or even losing weight. 24g of protein, 5.5g BCAA all in one small serving is valuable for the $46 price tag found in amazon.com and free shipping beats GNC and other supplement shops. So far i have only tried the vanilla ice cream and strawberry flavor (strawberry is banging!) and i must say they both taste great, i bet the other flavors are just as tasty, so many to choose from. Blends well with water and can be used to mix with other food like oats, fruits etc. I take 2 scoops a day (1 scoop while at work and another with creatine after working out) remember that this is a "supplement" do not replace your regular high protein meals with shakes, use it with 4 or 5 daily meals and you will get gains!
