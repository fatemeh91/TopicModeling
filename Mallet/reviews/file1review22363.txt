review/text: I registered for the terry changing pad cover thinking it was a good price and should do the trick!! I was WRONG!!! It started to unravel after the first washing and the softness goes away immediately. Spend the extra money and purchase the Chamois Cover from Pottery Barn Kids. It is worth the extra $5. I have two of them and they wash EXTREMELY well (stays soft, stains come out, etc.) and it has slits for the safety belt. If your baby is anything like mine he is on his changing pad quite a bit and I think he really likes the softness of the Chamois material.
