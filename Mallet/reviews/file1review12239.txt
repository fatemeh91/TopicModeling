review/text: My husband and I are planning on a baby soon so I wanted to take a pre natal that I could take once a day since I am horrible at remembering to take pills.. So far, the only problem I have had is constipation. Since I have had some prior issues, and this is not making it any better, I am a little concerned, but read some other reviews that suggested taking it every other day to help which I will do and increase water intake. As far as swallowing goes, I have to laugh at some people...if its that bad to swallow, take it in applesauce, or yogurt or something. I take it in applesauce, cant taste it, or feel it going down! I will also comment...it may give you some bad gas during the first week but that has since subsided. My poor husband LOL !!! good luck ladies =)
