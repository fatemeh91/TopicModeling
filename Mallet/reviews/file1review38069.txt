review/text: Generally protein bars either taste like sort of chalky bits of strangely gooey (sp?) chemicals - or are simply candy in disguise. I like the Myoplex bar, especially this version. It's tasty enough and it will actually hold me over until my next meal. The only drawback is that the chocolate melts a bit quickly - however, at least that seems natural compared to the chocolate goo of some of the others on the market.
