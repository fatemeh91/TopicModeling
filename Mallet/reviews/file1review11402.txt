review/text: I bought this because I lost my expensive professionally made guard. I immediately loved it.pros: Very comfortable, easy to clean, adjustable, good warranty, compact case.cons: The bite plates aren't that durable. I recommend buying the more expensive version if you think this might be a problem.needless to say, I'll be sticking with this guard. sorry mr dentist.
