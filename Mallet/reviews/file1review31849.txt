review/text: Shaving does a real number on my face. Aftershaves burn and don't really do what they are made to do. So I started looking for a balm. This stuff is expensive but well worth it. The bottle lasts a long time and the lavender scent is great. This doesn't burn at all. It's like a miracle. Apply this to your face after shaving and it will instantly feel like you didn't scrape your face raw. I will buy this as long as they continue making it. Save yourself the trouble...order this and give your face a break.
