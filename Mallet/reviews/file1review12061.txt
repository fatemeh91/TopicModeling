review/text: I do "HATE" large vitamins, so I started a fight when my pediatrician/husband bought them for me... Now, I'm online trying to purchase more.CONS: It's true, they're on the big side. But strangely, I don't have any problems swallowing them (I did with other ones). Also, they leave an aftertaste--as another reviewer said. But it goes away easily (juice, cracker, etc), and I usually take them with meals to improve absorption.PROS: They're easily digestible (I didn't have any of the sickness or heartburn suggested), it's once a day, and above all, it's all NATURAL--which is important for me.THE POINT: I didn't find any natural vitamins that were as easy to take.If you want any regular pre-natal vit, I'd go for the prescription ones: You take them once daily. They are small, tasteless, safe and very-very affordable.
