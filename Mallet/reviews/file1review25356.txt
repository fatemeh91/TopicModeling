review/text: I was shopping for a Scale and when I saw this was very impressed as it was a scale and a Body Fat Monitor at a reasonable rate. It does not give you an option to just weigh yourself. It's very slow and if you have more than 2 persons in your home then it's frustrating. Thought of returning it but Amazon was to charge me $10.0 for shipping. I got it for 20, so it was not worth returning and now I am stuck with it. I do not belive the bady fat monitor is accurate either.
