review/text: I'm sorry, but this item is a joke. There is absolutely nothing to this piece of elastic. The view is of the back and that is all there is, there is no front. Take a piece of elastic and put a rubber band at each end and there you have the "Posture Perfect Band, Back Support Brace" HA! Not worth returning, postage is more than the product. I wouldn't even rate this product with a -0, but I had to fill in all blanks and 1 star was as low as I could go.
