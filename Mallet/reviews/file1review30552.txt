review/text: Herbal Clear natural deodorant is a good inexpensive natural product. Costing less than $3 per stick, it's one of the most affordable natural deodorants on the market. I will freely admit that this is the main reason I decided to try this brand. The smell of the deodorant is a light, pleasant smell (clear aloe fresh scent). Not too feminine or too manly so that either sex can wear it comfortably. It's a clear solid type of deodorant that doesn't leave any marks on your clothing at all. The "clear solid" of other brands is usually still white and tends to leave faint marks on clothing, but not this brand, it's literally clear. This deodorant really keeps me dry throughout the entire day. The only thing I don't love more than my old chemical-laden deodorant is that this deodorant only keeps me smelling fresh for 10-12 hours. My old kind would keep me smelling fresh all day and all night, but this one requires a re-application late in the evening. Still, I think it's more affordable and works better than some of the more expensive natural deodorants. They also offer a sport version which may provide protection for a longer period of time, but I have not tried it yet.Among its other benefits, Herbal Clear donates a portion of their profits to breast cancer prevention. This deodorant is hypoallergenic, contains vitamins A & E, and does not contain aluminum, parabens, alcohol, dyes, or artificial bactericides. Manufactured by 21st Century HealthCare and made in Canada.
