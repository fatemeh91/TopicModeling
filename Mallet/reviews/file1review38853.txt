review/text: I have used this pre-shave since 1968. I have only been able to find it in a small local home town drug store the last 10 years+/-. When I tried to purchase it last week the product had been discontinued and would no longer carry the product. I ordered it from another company, they also say it had been discontinued. No large stores or drug stores have the product in or around South Alabama. I hope Mennen does not stop selling this pre=shave altogether. I do not like Williams ande other preshave.
