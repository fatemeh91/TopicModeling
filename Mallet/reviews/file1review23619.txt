review/text: My only complaint about this product is that it is difficult to find anywhere else. I am glad I discovered it through Amazon and really hope they continue carrying it! I agree totally with the other positive reviews.A little bit of the soap goes a long way in washing both hair and body. It lathers great and my daughters hair smells so clean and fresh until her next bath. Since birth my 2 1/2 year old has had some rough and slightly bumpy skin on her upper arms. Since using this product, that problem has gone away and her skin is never dry. I also think three (good size) bottles for $15 is a great value, especially since the soap does last longer than other bath washes we have tried.
