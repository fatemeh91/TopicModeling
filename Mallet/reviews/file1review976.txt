review/text: I ordered this Futuro Stabilizing Knee Support because I wanted a beige colored one(I have a black McDavid knee brace and it did not come in beige), but I was a little disappointed with it. I don't get the support I get with my McDavid one. I will still use the Futuro, but not for walking for a long distance.
