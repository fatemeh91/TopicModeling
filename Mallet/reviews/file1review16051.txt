review/text: I am a doctor and needed a small reliable tool to check out middle ears during my travels. I wanted batteries, because I may not be able to recharge the unit. This works, well, good light and you can use it with the bulb and perform procedures through it, not that I want to, but it is good to know that you can. Would do nusiness gain with the seller.
