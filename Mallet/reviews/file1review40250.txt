review/text: While I generally like the ingredients in most of All Terrain natural products, buyers should be aware that this product contains the following active ingredients: Octinoxate 7.0%, Octisalate 4.5%, Zinc Oxide 4.5%, Oxybenzone 3.5%.Personally I didn't like the texture of this lipblock but I am reasonably sure with all those active ingredients it is a solid sun protector.
