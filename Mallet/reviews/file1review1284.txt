review/text: My first cycle of Symbiotropin was back in college when it first came out. Somewhere around 2002 if I recall. I have taken this product on and off for 1-2 month time-frames as I have started and stopped workout cycles. Like the other reviewers have stated, sleep quality and energy increases. What they fail to mention are the muscular gains if coupled with a serious anaerobic workout regiment and nutrition program. I recall in 1 month adding serious strength gains and shedding pounds. You will go throughout your day full of energy and workout recovery is simply phenomenal. I recommend actually doubling the dosage (never tried Meditropin which is 2x strength) to 2 tablets at night and 2 in the morning. The absolute key to this product is taking it on an empty stomach. If you fail to do that you will not see any of the benefits. I've also often thought that another bonus of this supplement is the sustained energy and recovery times I noticed. Maybe it was placebo effect, but I worked out harder and faster and retained the energy to really push my workouts. The mid-workout plateau or burnout stopped after a few days on this. Follow the directions, eat healthy and add two doses of Designer Whey (second product I recommend...) throughout the day and I'm positive your results will be similar.
