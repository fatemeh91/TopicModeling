review/text: When I shave, the results only last a day and regrowth is too noticeable to not shave everyday! Because the price was pretty steep and epilating seemed painful, I waited a while to purchase this product. However, I'm extremely happy I purchased the Emjoi Optima, because not only are the hair growth on my legs less noticeable, I also don't have to go through the hassle of shaving EVERY day. Although, I still have to use the Emjoi every couple of days - its still a lot better than shaving! Keep in mind that the first time you use the Emjoi, it hurts a whole lot, but using it afterwards is nothing (when compared to the first time).
