review/text: I was very pleasantly surprised with the size and quality of this product. The cost was also reasonable which is great in these economic times. Unfortunately, you can't control when a pet becomes incontinent and that is what I'm using this product for. I would highly recommend this product. In fact, I think I'm going to purchase some more to use around the house.
