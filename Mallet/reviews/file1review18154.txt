review/text: When I received the item, it was apparent that it was a cheaply made product. I now understand what others have said about the velcro joining the two strips in the back of the head. It'll create a bump where the strips overlap and I'm not sure how comfortable it'll be. I have not used this item yet, but will be taking a 5-hour red-eye flight and connecting to a 6-hour flight this Saturday. I'll see how it goes.
