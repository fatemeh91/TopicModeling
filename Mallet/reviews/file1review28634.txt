review/text: I have tried many whey protein products, and this is the best combination of nutritional content (not many carbs), great taste, and a reasonable price. I use a heaping scoop on top of yogurt every morning, but it is also easy to shake into a beverage. Chocolate Malt is my favorite flavor, but Double Rich Chocolate and Vanilla Ice cream are not bad either. (Stay away from the banana!!)
