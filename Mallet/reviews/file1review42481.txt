review/text: It mixes good, very few clumps, and chocolate mint is probably the best flavor I've had with any brand of protein. They claim it has an added enzyme for lactose intolerant people, but it still jacks my stomach up. A few lactaid pills and a few tums and I still get an upset stomach and horrible gas. I'm going to try a few other products that are lactose free before coming back to elite.
