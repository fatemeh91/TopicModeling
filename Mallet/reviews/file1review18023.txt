review/text: I have occasional insomnia when I am stressed and I found a sleep mask helps. My first bucky sleep mask I found in Marshall's for $4.99 and have been obsessed ever since. It feels like there is nothing on your face.As for other negative comments, I sleep on my side for the most part and have never noticed the bulky-ness of the Velcro. Also, as for the falling apart, when you are using something daily for an extended amount of time, it is going to wear out. I'm onto my second one now and my first one is still usable it just looks a little wore out.Great product for cheap!
