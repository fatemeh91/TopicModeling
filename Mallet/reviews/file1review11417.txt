review/text: I have used this product for a few years and I love it. The night guard I got from the dentist fell apart the first night! I have had 3 of the Sleep Right guards, when I first got it, I clenched really hard, it lasted almost a year, the second one I lost, and this time, I am sure will last lots longer because it has actually taught me to lessen the grip at night. Definitely recommend this!
