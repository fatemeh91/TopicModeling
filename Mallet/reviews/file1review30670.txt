review/text: This razor has a small but important learning curve. If you're used to using something like a Mach 3 (as that was my first wet shave razor)or any of the multi-blades this will take some getting used to. Small easy strokes with absolutely no pressure except by the weight of this razor are the way to go. Do one stroke with one side, another stroke with the other then rense. One pass with the grain for most is the way to go but if you desire a closer shave then I suggest re-lather, (which is important for wetshaving) and lightly shave across, not against the grain. For those wanting a good shave, you will have to spend a little more time than using the multiblade razors. I suggest a badger hair brush with some traditional shave cream or soap like Geo F. Trumpers or Trufitt or Taylor of Old Bond Street. Plan on no less than five minutes for a good close shave from the start of lathering to toweling off. I also suggest a skin food from Trumpers or some preshave oil from The Art of Shaving that will help the razor glide. I enjoy this razor way more than any multi-blade and I think any user who will take the time to learn to use it will to. If you're constantly in a hurry to shave and be on your way, I don't suggest using this razor or any other double edge or straight razor for that matter.
