review/text: I felt a slight cold coming on with that slight throat tickling felling and stuffy sinuses so I figured to ditch my usual Emergen-C& X2O approach and try Gaia Herbs Quick Defense since I needed to review it anyway. I did as suggested, two capsules five times a day for two days, and I can honestly say, by the end of day one, any sign of a cold was gone. Still, I finished out the next day. The one thing I noticed was my voice felt smoother if that makes any sense. Considering a few of the ingredients are Black Elderberry, Ginger Root and Chlorophyll, I am assuming that plays a big role in this bonus. If you are a singer and on the road or in the studio, you may want to keep a bottle of this in your gig bag. However, the one thing that is a little unnerving is that one bottle is basically supply, as if it were a medication prescription to be taken until completed, which I felt was kind of weird. Again, maybe it's not, maybe it would force a person to finish the dose. Also, you can get it in 40 count, so you could have two doses if needed. All in all, I've going to order another bottle to have it on hand to use in conjunction with the other things I do for cold prevention.
