review/text: I have been wearing the gell cusion for my left foot for only 4 days and the discomfort I was in had dropped drastically. I have a bunion that has shifted my weight incorrctly when walking and as such the ball of my foot takes more stress than it should. In time it builds up to unbearable pain when I get off work. I hobble at times from the discomfort and try hand massaging that foot area but it was so tender I could't do that for long. I used this product for 4 days, even in stocking feet around the house and I also bought the socks that have the toe separators in them and between the combination my foot pain barily exists. They hold to the foot very well and I have not had any shifting issues with it. It is not too thick or too thin and seem to do the trick. Wished I had known of these before instead of enduring such discomfort for so long. If you have metatarsil foot pain, these are well worth the money....
