review/text: Bought it, and tested it out on my 18m old son with really really long hair. Never touched haircutting in my life and after 15mins we had a very presentable son - despite him constantly moving his head and whining. I expect my second effort to be even better but I am SOOO glad I bought it. These things are so cheap you can throw them away after 3 cuts and you've still saved money! Be brave - you'll be amazed at the number of volunteers you will get (mainly parents with young kids!)
