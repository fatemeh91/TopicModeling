review/text: This stuff works very well. When I feel a cold coming on, I start taking it. After about an hour I feel much better. It doesn't get rid of my symptoms completely, but more like 80%. It's awesome.The only downside is it tends to be expensive (unless you buy online!). I might take 3 or 4 doses a day for a few days.The best part about it is that it is non-drug. It's definitely much better for you than any drug-based medicine.
