review/text: I have been plagued by herpes, on my lip, since I was a small child. I tried several remedies over the years, but, Super Lysine Cream is one of the cures that was definitely more effective. It contains L-lysine, Propolis Extract, Calendula Flower Extract, Echinacea Flower Extract, Zinc Oxide, Goldenseal Extract, Vitamin A, D, E, Cajeput Oil, Tea Tree Oil, Gum Benzoin Tincture, Prepared in a Beeswax and Olive Base for maximum absorption. I have to say that my delicate lip area feels protected, cooled and less swollen, every time I use this wonderful product. A note: A little goes a long way.
