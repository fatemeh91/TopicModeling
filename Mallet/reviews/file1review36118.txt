review/text: The system seems to work even in shorter spans of eight or nine days. Unlike other cleansing systems, this one doesn't make you feel groggy. The 'rebuild' part of the system seems to work well and keeps the digestive system working properly. This system only works if you drink lots of water throughout the day, otherwise you will get a headache and may not notice any benefit. We were vegetarians already but the system still helped clean out my system and, after a week, I felt more energetic and less weighed down.
