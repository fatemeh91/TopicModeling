review/text: The flavor is so strong in the cinnamon and plain peppermint versions that I can't eat them. These chocolate mints, however, have a nice, minty, light chocolate flavor that I really like. And using these for my caffeine addiction instead of Coke or Pepsi has helped me lose quite a bit of weight! If I don't want to buy or mess around with making coffee in the a.m., I have 3 or 4 of these. Then a few more with lunch instead of a soft drink, and a couple in the afternoon if I want a little boost. And never the bloated, gassy feeling that carbonated drinks can give. Really, they're perfect!
