review/text: The entire braun pro series DOES NOT OFFER BATTERY REPLACEMENT!!! $160 for a toothbrush and you have to throw it out after the battery dies??? Proctor & Gamble strikes again. Throw it away and buy another one is exactly what braun customer service told me!!!PLEASE CALL BRAUN CS 800-566-5752 ask about battery replacement. this is truly a horrible thing. THrow it away in the landfill after 2 years, with the metal hydride battery (again in the landfill) all because P&G; wants you to buy a new $160 toothbrush always instead of a $5 battery.DO NOT BUY!!!
