review/text: I have two American bulldogs (they have short hair) that shed and it sticks on my couch. I've tried many different brushes and lint removers, but this product truly delivers. In a matter of minutes, my couch was virtually pet hair free. It is extremely powerful; the only thing I don't like is the motor gets pretty hot.
