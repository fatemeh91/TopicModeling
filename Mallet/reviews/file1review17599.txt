review/text: This is my third one of these. I love these things--I love the shape and way it cuts, but the battery on these things eventually just dies, to the point where you cannot use it without having it plugged into the charger, and then, eventually, it will barely work when plugged in. For me, it has taken at least a year for this to happen though, therefore justifying the relatively cheap cost compare to more fancy trimmers. I will buy more, even when my third one croaks in a year or so, unless I can find something better, which I haven't : )
