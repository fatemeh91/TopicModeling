review/text: I am on my first bottle of Iberogast. I was diagnosed with IBS thirty-five years ago and took Bentyl for 17 years. Because Bentyl caused unwanted side-effects, I went off of it and my intestinal trouble remained. I have tried many products, along with acupuncture, massage,and meditation. Iberogast seems to be helping the most. My digestion has calmed, and I have much less gas and bloating.
