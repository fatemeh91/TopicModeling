review/text: Let me start out by saying I am a pen fanatic. In general I love Cross pens. That said, this pen comes in handy with its two ink colors and a .05mm pencil. I like it for its convenience. But other then that it is a blah pen. The micro point cartridge is not your usual Cross point. It is more of a fine point, not a medium point as I prefer. Also, I prefer the heft of the regular medium point to the light weight feeling of the Tech 3. I gave the pen 3 stars because of the handy nature. Would I buy this pen again? Not unless it as a gift.
