review/text: Okay, so for the skeptics, I will try to keep this short and to the point. I am in the process of using this product. I did not get it from Amazon, I got it at a local CVS. I was looking for the Freeze stuff (I was totally in the dark about wart remover things) and saw that they cost upwards of 16 or more dollars. I decided to go with the stick instead. I have been using it for a few weeks. I applied it to a wart that has been on my finger for a while now, and after maybe a week it started to peel off. I.was.a.mazed. I would rub the edge of the stick around the wart to try to keep it from getting all over my finger (since the wart is fairly small). This has kept the peeling down to a minimum on my good skin. I have let it dry for a while to allow my skin some heal time, but I will continue treatment this week. It really does work (so far, to an extent).
