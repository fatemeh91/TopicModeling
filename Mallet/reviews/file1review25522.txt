review/text: My Sasquatch-like nostrils were becoming unmanageable.The unsightly nose hairs were so long they would sometimes get tangled, causing me extreme, eye-watering pain. During cold and flu season, it was not uncommon for me to get some &quot;leftovers&quot; stuck in my nose.I needed something that could tame the beast that resided inside my nose.I needed something that could cut through dense foliage, and not look back.Who was up for the challenge? Not many.I tried a number of different grooming tools, but none of them achieved the level of trimming that I desired. The &quot;pretender groomers&quot; (as I like to call them) would either yank out the hairs at an excruciatingly slow pace, or I would be left with stubble inside my nose. The ladies might like the &quot;George Michael&quot; 5 o'clock shadow, but nobody likes a 5 o'clock shadow in your nostrils.After many failed attempts, I was convinced that there wasn't a tool available that could handle my rigorous grooming demands. I was ready to give up and resort to using my blunt, miniature scissors for the rest of my life.And then I discovered the Panasonic Nose and Ear Hair Groomer.This remarkable piece of equipment mows down everything in its path. No pain, minimal motor noise (for those seeking a discrete trim), and it works equally well in wet or dry conditions. So, worry not Seattle natives!The one AA battery usually doesn't last long enough for me to complete my grooming ritual, but the 90-minute battery life should be more than sufficient for the rest of you. With an ergonomically designed stainless-steel blade that retains its sharpness, the Panasonic Nose and Ear Hair Groomer is the first and last personal groomer you will ever need.However, I'm slightly disturbed by Amazon's option to buy it used.
