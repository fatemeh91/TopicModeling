review/text: I can't speak for the effectiveness of the product yet...only been a few days and no weight lifting yet. However, as for the taste I thought my description may help lol. It tastes like stagnant water. Not absolutely repulsive, but not great. I mix mine with Beta-Alinine and Citrulline Malate.My tip...Use the MIO drink mixes to flavor your water. It helps a LOT! No sugar!
