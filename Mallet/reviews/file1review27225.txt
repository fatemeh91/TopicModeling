review/text: good stuff... comparing the nutritional label to the CytoSport from the Makers of Muscle Milk 6 lb bag I usually get at Costco for $30's, but the price is creeping up increasingly. I've also bought EAS Whey which among these 3 I'd rate bottom on taste and mixability, it also gave me a bloaty/gassy feeling. The ON has a lot less Cholesterol, Fat, and Sodium per serving. Both of their chocolate flavors taste great. I work out everyday doing 5-8 mi of running, followed by weight/strength training so I ordered 2 - 10 lb bags w/ Amazon's Subscribe and Save for my morning protein smoothie and my post work out protein supplement.Price is good/competitive w/ the S&S; and cost effective bulk sizingNutritional facts are goodTaste is goodMixes and goes down well even in plain water.here is the Nutritional facts from the 3 that I've tried. Unless I find something better or Amazon raises the price a lot I'm sticking w/ ON and have Subscribe and Save set up for a shipment every 3 months.ON Gold Standard 100% Whey Double Chocolate 10lb bag:Serving Size 1 scoop (30.4g)Servings per container 149Calories 120Calories from Fat 10Total Fat 1g - 2%Saturated Fat 0.5gTrans Fat 0gCholesterol 30mg - 10%Sodium 130mg - 5%Total Carbohydrate 3g - 1%Sugars 1gProtein 24gBCAAs 5.5gVitamin A 0%Vitamin C 0%Calcium 8%Iron 2%Costco CytoSport/Muscle Milk (6lb bag/Chocolate):Serving Size 1 scoop (35g)Servings per container 78Calories 140Calories from Fat 20Total Fat 2g - 3%Saturated Fat 1g - 6%Trans Fat 0gCholesterol 60mg - 20%Sodium 150mg - 8%Total Carbohydrate 3g - 1%Sugars 1gProtein 27g - 54%BCAA's - 6gCalcium 15%Iron 4%EAS 100% Whey Protein (5lb tub) Vanilla:Serving Size 1 scoop (30g)Servings per container 75Calories 120Calories from Fat 20Total Fat 2g - 3%Saturated Fat 1g - 4%Trans Fat 0gCholesterol 70mg - 24%Sodium 50mg - 2%Total Carbohydrate 2g - 1%Sugars 1gProtein 23g - 46%BCAA's - 5.6gCalcium 145 mg15%Iron &lt;1mg 2%Potassium 170mg (other brands didn't list)
