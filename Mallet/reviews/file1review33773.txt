review/text: I chose a 5 Star rating because I have always heard about Tend Skin being so great and that it really stops the ingrown hairs but I've never tried it. Finally decided to and I really like it. It keeps the hairs from curling back under the skin and causing bumps. I use it before going to bed and after shaving. I would definitely recommend.
