review/text: Hi I just saw the post about fires and called the company. I spoke with Steve Powers the owner. The current owner bought it in 2006 and completely rebuilt the vaporizer. Added 3 new safety features, TCL switch, ceramic casings, all kinds of technical stuffs. He has never had any problems with fire or hazardous malfunctions since the rebuild of the product. He said he has had 3 returns for various reasons since 2006. Thats a pretty darn good track record. He was very helpful and had alot of information for me. Nice to see someone who is proud of his product and stands behind it 100%. I bought this product for my 18month old for congestion and been using the eucalyptus pads and they have worked great! I am very impressed with the product. This is a great American product and I am happy to support a home-grown business.
