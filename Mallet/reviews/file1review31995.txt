review/text: I don't think any of us get enough of our fruits and veggies, so drinking the "green stuff" (which is really Perfect Food by Garden of Life) lets me know I"m getting what I need.I feel so good and have more energy now, so I have shared with my friends.Six of my family and friends are now using it. I' 66 years old, and making lots of healthy choices now . Never too late to get healthy and Perfect Food is a big part of it. I find the best prices are on Amazon.
