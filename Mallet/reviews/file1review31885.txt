review/text: What a wonderful product!!! Truly beneficial... I have a truly thick heavy beard, I dull a Gillette Fusion in a single shave, and get bad razor burn... my solution was a full beard, that is until I tried this (well Pre-Shave oils in general) and this particular brand quickly became my favorite. Preshave oil, Badger Brush, Shave SOAP, Straight Razor/Safety Razor, and a high quality post shave balm made all the difference in the world.This particular product is the best value for money out of the Quality shave oils on the market... its more expensive than the worthless 'who knows what's in it' bargain store brand, but one of the most affordable and effective, $5-10 less than the other Quality brands. I will continue to buy this product for as long as they make it.
