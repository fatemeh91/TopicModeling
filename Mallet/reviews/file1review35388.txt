review/text: I feel in love with Spiru-tein when I used to get the small, pre-mixed cartons. They made me feel great, and tasted great. This powder is also good, but it can be really hard to mix. I have been a vegetarian since 1987, and Spiru-tein is the best protein supplement I have found. You will need a mixing bottle or a really good blender with slower settings to mix this with milk.
