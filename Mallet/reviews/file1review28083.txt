review/text: This is not acceptable. I purchased this whey because it was a good deal. I ordered it with my credit card, and have a receipt for my purchase. Why was this order cancelled? You cancel my order, and tell me to repurchase it for 3x the price I just paid for it. This is complete false advertising. I have had great experiences with amazon for the past few years, but this is unacceptable! Bait and switch tactics without any explanation.It is a horrible business practice to lure people in with a good price, then attempt to force them to pay a greater price for the same product.Your urgent attention to this matter would be appreciated.
