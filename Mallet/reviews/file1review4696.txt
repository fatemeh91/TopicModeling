review/text: I'm on a low-carb diet and use this for at least one meal. It fills me up very well. I use a blender with some Splenda to sweeten it up and it's pretty good, especially with a straw, to make me feel special. Sometimes I add a little unsweetened yogurt to give it a tang and extra creaminess and that makes it even better.
