review/text: After having extensively researched these online, I was eager to try it out: and it is fabulous!The perfect shape for my extra large head;stylish patterns; and best of all, light as a feather--the Tempurpedic one I used to have but never used felt like a fleece covered brick lying on my face.It's cut extremely large, and I don't understand people's complaints about light leaking--it's not spywear; presumably your eyes are closed at night, so a tiny bit of light is no problem. And the strap is very unobtrusive--I fasten it under my hair, don't feel it at all, and it keeps my hair fluffy and off my neck.Very well thought out and constructed--I immediately ordered 3 more as gifts.My sleep has improved immensely since using this!!!!
