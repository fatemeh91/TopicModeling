review/text: I just recently bought severl bottles of this specific magnesium product because I was told that 'taurate' works better than any other magnesium type for treating depresssion (or in my case Bipolar Disorder - Depressive). First, I was wondering if this is true or any type of magnesium has just the same or similar effect. I've been taking two a day equal to 250mg. But that still seems like too little but if I take any more, a bottle runs out fairly fast (less than a month). The most important thing though, is to find the right dosage to take specifically to treat Bipolar Depression. Do any health professionals know the proper dosage to take daily??? Also, anybody know what other supplements might help this dreaded debillitating recurring illness???
