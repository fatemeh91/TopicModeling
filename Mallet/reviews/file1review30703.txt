review/text: I received my razor today and tried it out a few hours ago. I have been using the Gillette razors for years and only recently discovered this whole world of "classic shaving".I started out with a single edge Gem razor I found in an antique shop. They no longer make single edge razors, but you can occasionally find the blades. I just had too hard of a time finding blades for it, so I decided to try the Merkur double edge razor because it was highly recommended in several online reviews. I also ordered some Derby extra blades to use with this razor.After lathering up and assembling the razor with one of the Derby Extra blades, I had a very smooth and pleasant shaving experience. I am thoroughly pleased with it. The derby blades are so sharp the whiskers offer zero resistance. It glides through them as if they aren't even there.Like other reviewers have stated, you don't need to apply as much pressure. the blades are so incredibly sharp that all you need to do is gently "wipe" the lather off you face with the razor and the whiskers come off with it.Also, like other reviewers have said, this isn't for those of you in a rush. I'd still keep a modern razor handy for those times when you are in a hurry (or a lot of bandaids and styptic pencils). This is for those times when you want to really enjoy a great, close, careful shave. It's like the man version of a bubble bath, a way to spoil yourself.Another advantage is that the blades cost WAY less than Gillette cartridges. I got the 100 pack of derby blades for 15 dollars. Even if I only use each blade 4 times, I will still be able to shave for over a year with 100 blades. At 15 cents per blade that beats the heck out of the Gillette cartridges.If you want to treat yourself to a luxurious, traditional shave this is the way to go.
