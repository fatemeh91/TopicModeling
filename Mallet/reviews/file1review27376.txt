review/text: First off, I've used a lot of protein powders in the past. I can't tell you which ones have worked better than the others or anything like that. No change in protein powder is going to make you bigger; you get bigger and stronger by lifting consistently and correctly, and also by providing your body with the correct amount and type of nutrition.That being said, from the nutrition facts label, this is by far one of the best proteins out there on the market. The taste is great (and I just drink mine with water) and you can tell that there isn't too much sweetener in this powder. I've used muscle milk before and still do occasionally when it goes on sale, but there's way too much sugar in it. Optimum is always consistent and holds itself to the highest of standards; they put out products that you can trust in. Aforementioned, I drink this as a supplement after my workouts. It's a well known fact that one must provide him or herself with a healthy dosage of both carbs and protein shortly after a workout, and that's precisely what I use this for, especially when I know I can't get a meal in within forty five minutes of finishing a workout.In conclusion, you can't go wrong with this protein. I haven't had any problems with it and I've been using it for a while now. It is my protein of choice. 5 pounds should last a while. I definitely recommend it. Four stars
