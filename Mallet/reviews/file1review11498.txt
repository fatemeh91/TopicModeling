review/text: This design is just horrible. I bought this to trim my goatee which I keep pretty short. This was no problem with the unit I had before, but it's near impossible to get a decent trim with this thing. If you look at the picture, you don't trim with the front edge like you do with other bear trimmers, but instead have to use the spring loaded flat top part. The results from my second shave with this thing was a way short trim over my top lip and a much longer hair under my nose. Also, while trimming along my chin I seem to have tilted the thing just right to get a very short trim on one spot which looked real bad. I tried to go back and trim the rest to match, but I just couldn't seem to get the trimmer at just the right angle to get an even trim. Since I already had the thing set to 1 my only other option would have been to remove the guard and free-hand the trim. Needless to say, I spent the next couple days with a very uneven goatee.The next problem I have with this thing is that you can't just plug it in and use it. It has to charge before you can use it, so if a charge runs out before you are done trimming, you have to wait until it charges to finish. This is completely opposite to the way their electric razors work, where if the charge runs low while shaving, you just plug it in and continue.Overall, you might want to use this if you have a full beard, or a thick goatee, but if you want to keep it trimmed short, this is not the product for you. I'm going to go buy something else.
