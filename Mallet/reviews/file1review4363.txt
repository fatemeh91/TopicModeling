review/text: Last year I got a gift of Gillette razor and two 5-blade cartridges. They were superb in performance gliding easy on my skin. They lasted for almost 12 months; yes, one full year. Encouraged from this experience I ordered these cartridges[ASIN:B004B8AZH0 Gillette Fusion Manual Cartridges, 12-Count] from Amazon. In fact, I subscribed to receive a supply every six months. These new blades do not shave the way the ealier ones did. There is no comparison. These ones do not glide smoothly, I need to pull the razor and it makes scraping sound! As if I am sharpening a razor on a leather belt! The quality of shave is not at all close and clean and it irritates the skin. I was so much impressed with earlier Gillette experience that I did not contact Amazon immediately and kept trying different blades.... even after 3 or 4 different cartridges still no luck.The mineral oil is missing in the strip. Very poor experience....and I have now decided to return the unused cattridges and cancel my subsciption for future supply.Update : 01/04/2012My earlier experience was with Fusion Proglide! And, this review covers Fusion. There is noticeable difference in experience from Fusion and Fusion proglide. I can not understand why Gillette should have very similar nomneclature for two different products which led to this confusion. My repeat experience with Fusion Proglide blades is excellent.
