review/text: I can't say enough good things about this item. My daughter-in-law has one and I've wanted one ever since I saw (and heard) hers. So I bought myself one and when my mother-in-law saw it, she had to have one for herself and one to send to her sister. So she had me order these two on my Amazon account. You wouldn't think a little box could pack so much atmosphere into your room, but it really does. The loons are my favorite sound, they drive my husband crazy but he loves the thunder. My mother-in-law loves the birdsounds and leaves it on day and night for its soothing effect. The first night we had this thing we put it on thunder and fell asleep on the couches where we slept like babies all night long. Get one of these, turn off the lights and enjoy the lights as well -- you'd think the lighted colored rain effect would be kind of cheesy but it's just so cool. The summer night setting reminds me of being in the Blue Bayou Restaurant adjacent to the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland. Can you tell I like my Rainforest Fountain? Get one. You must experience this.
