review/text: I've been looking for a heating pad that would actually get hot enough to do some good, after waisting my money on several of them that claimed to be the best I finally found one. Thermophore Moist Heating Pad is absolutely the best I've every used. I just wish they would make one that gets this hot in an automatic version.
