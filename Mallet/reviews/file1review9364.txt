review/text: This is a great product. I gave it to my dad for the holidays because it is portable and has a spot for AM and PM. He would put his vitamins in a tissue and half the time they would fall on the floor. I use it as well and it keeps me organized and I love the option of putting each day's compartment in my pocket, so I can take my vitamins at lunch!
