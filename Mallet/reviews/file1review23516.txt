review/text: I've suffered from IBS for years, and over time I had developed a coping process that was usually effective. Heather's Tummy fiber has improved my process! The amazing thing is that you feel no side effects. No sugar rush or bloated feeling from fiber bars. It feels like nothing, and yet I really sense an improvement. I used to start my day with two slices of high fiber toast and then a granola bar. I honestly think I could do well on the Acacia packet alone. Great product!!
