review/text: We got it due to all of the amazing reviews and assumed it would fit on what we thought was a normal size toilet. We rent a duplex and the bathroom is a little small for a normal home but is the usual size for any type of renting. I don't think this toilet or the last 4, from previous apartments, is any different in size and even with the adjustments this trainer will not fit.It's too oval shaped and goes right up the back of the toilet seat making it a very awkward and barely usable fit. Be careful if you think your toilet is a little small or of a more rounded than oval shape.
