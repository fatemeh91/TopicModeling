review/text: I remember, back in the day (probably circa 1995), Ricola ran a series of melodious and memorable television ads for their cough drops, featuring an elderly Swiss man yodeling "Rrriccccola!" and playing a meter long horn, from the tip of the Swiss alps, with great triumph. Pretty much, that embodies the strength and effectiveness of these awesome cough drops. The combination of cherry, honey and herbs coats and soothes, at the same time. It, most definitely, brings me sweet relief, during my collisions with the common cold. I also feel I can take these without worrying about the source of their ingredients - I can easily pronounce healing additions to this product. Recommended.
