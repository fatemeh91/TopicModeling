review/text: I bought the clipper because my son's hair grows like a weed. I got the kit and watched the DVD....I have never used clippers to cut hair before and was a little conserned that I was going to mess it up. I used the different combs included in the set and it was really easy to do. His hair looks great and other people think that he went to a barber to have it done, and that was only my first time using it. Thank you for this awesome product, my son will look better and I will have more money, since I do not have to take him to the barbers all of the time now.Mickella
