review/text: This little machine is powerful and convenient to use -- easy to empty, etc. However, the brush is pretty much useless. I bought this cleaner to try to keep up with cat hair on my sofa and in my car (gets carried there on my clothes). In both cases, the end of the hose is much better at picking it up than the brush. The brush seems to distribute the suction so it's nearly non-existent. There's no convenient way to stow the cord other than wrapping it around the body of the tool. Although there's a built in clip near the plug that is made to secure the end of the cord, there are no prongs or hooks to wrap it around. That said, it does the job I intended, just not as elegantly as I'd hoped!
