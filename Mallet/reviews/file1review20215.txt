review/text: This product is pretty good. It does not have the perfect fresh black cherry taste that I have experienced with a product that was twice the price, but it is not bad. We paid less than $5.00 for the 16oz., so bang for our buck was exceptional. We have paid twice that price for similar sizes. We are happy with the product. My husband swears by black cherry for his recurring gout.
