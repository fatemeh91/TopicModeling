review/text: This perfume truly lives up to its name. It is simply a pretty fresh foral smell that leaves you feeling like a princess. The smell is light enough to wear everyday or you can sprits a bit more for a elegant scent to last through the night. With an equally beautiful bottle this has got to be one of my favorite perfumes out there!
