review/text: I have tried three different flavors so far and extreme milk chocolate was by far the best. Double rich chocolate was a disappointment but mint chocolate was also quite good. I can't tell if this product works better than other protein powders, but it is in the middle of the pack pricing wise and at the top taste wise. Highly recommend.EDIT:Tastiness of flavors I've tried so far:Mint Chocolate: 8/10Double rich chocolate: 5/10Extreme Milk Chocolate: 10/10Rocky Road: 7/10Vanilla Ice Cream: 5/10Cookies and Cream: 7/10
