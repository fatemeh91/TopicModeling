review/text: As a college student, I was really excited about this at first. I thought, WOW, I don't need to spend extra money on shaving cream/gel and it would be a quick shave. However, my excitement over this razor quickly diminished. The moisturizor around the blades wore down unevenly leaving a need to actually use gel/cream. Also, the shave itself is not very close. I am just overall disappointed with this porduct and went back to my Venus razor as soon as I used up the Intuition blades.
