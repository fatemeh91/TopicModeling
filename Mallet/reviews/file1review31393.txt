review/text: I used the Tuli's Heavy Duty Gel Heel Cups when I had plantar fascitis. After that cleared up I got these heel cups because the sides are not as tall so they don't show over the top of my shoes. These still have the waffle pattern in the center so they give the same comfort as the heel cups with the waffle pattern all over. I also like the idea that you can hand wash these when needed.
