review/text: I bought this after trying GNC's whey protein. This protein blows it out of the water. For starters, I know that lots of people say it, but the taste is phenomenal. I have the rocky road and I plan on trying the cookies and cream flavor next time. Also, I definitely feel as though it is helping with my weight lifting. Not like it's a miracle supplement, but it helps me between one set of lifting and the next, giving me faster recovery times than I am used to, and helping to get my protein uptake up to what it should be. Anyway, it is good, and it is worth it.
