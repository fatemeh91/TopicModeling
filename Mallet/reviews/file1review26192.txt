review/text: I was excited to order this cause I've been looking for a fun toy. When I got it the plastic rubbery odor was horrible. I even washed it a couple times and it didn't go away.Also it's wayy too thick. I tried everything and it didn't work.For someone who can handle how big it is and not mind the odor it's great!
