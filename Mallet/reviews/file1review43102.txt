review/text: I got it and was really excited to use for my back support as I reached 8 months pregnancy. But it's really annoying to wear it and try to cover it with turtle necked sweater all the time. Otherwise the white belt will show up around my neckline. Not sure if other people have the same issue. Can you imagine If you use it during the summer? Don't know how you can hide it!!! Had to take a loss to return it because it's unbearable!
