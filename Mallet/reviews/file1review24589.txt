review/text: My husband and I started taking this product....I got chest pains, trouble breathing, so nausated I couldn't ride in a car. and I felt like I was freaking out...my eyes were real darty....horrible feeling. My husband broke out in a rash all over....I mean ALL OVER.....even the unmentionables. He itched every where. We both experience weight gain and bloatedness. NO WEIGHT LOSS at all. We bought this at GNC for $59.00, not knowing it was here. SO Price doesn't always mean better product. If there was a NO STAR catagory this wouldn't even qualify for that.
