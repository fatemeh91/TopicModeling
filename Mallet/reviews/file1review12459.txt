review/text: After an intense step aerobics workout, I started experiencing pain in my left heel and couldn't make sense of it and it wouldn't go away; after a short trip to the ER, the doctor informed me I had plantar fasciitis. GREAT. So after much research, this FREEDOM Dorsal PF Night Splint seemed to be what I needed, and the price was right.I put it on before bed, (with a sock, which I found more comfortable than a bare foot) and about half way through the night my toes would fall asleep; I mean to the point of numbness, and I would end up waking up in discomfort and ripping it off at like 2am. I wore it repeatedly thinking I had the velcro strap over my foot too tightly. Even after loosening it up, it still was never completely comfortable. I did make it through several nights of sleeping successfully, and noticed an improvement in my heel pain. For some reason, I just eventually stop wearing it, and gave up; I think half the time I would just forget to even put it on before bed. I suppose I need to give it another try as I believe I'm still not healed.I went home for a visit, and my mom gave me her splint she got from the podiatrist (for the same issue) to try, and it was even worse! It was the hard style, and it made me feel like I had to remain stationary all night and couldn't move. THAT was a fail! So, I think I'll just start wearing mine again and see how it goes, because heel pain is simply inconvenient!
