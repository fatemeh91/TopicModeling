review/text: I just got the rocky road flavor in the mail right now. I think it tastes better than the double rich chocolate. It mixes very well with milk. The rocky road seems to mix even better.Be warned however, the flavor is STRONG with rocky road. I actually wish it wasn't so strong. I put about 1.5 scoops in about 3 measured cups of milk. It's a strong splenda type flavor. I generally try to chug it as fast as I can without breathing so the flavor isn't as strong lol. But the powder itself seems to work pretty well.I feel like my results at the gym have been improved due to the protein powder.
