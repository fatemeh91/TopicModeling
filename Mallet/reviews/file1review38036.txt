review/text: Sudden heart stoppage is a common cause of death. CPR and defibrillation are techniques that can start the heart again and give the patient time to get needed help at a hospital. This unit is an external defibrillator that can start the heart with the help of another trained person who is available immediately within a few minutes to intervene and start the heart again. All persons should see their doctor to have the risk evaluated. In addition to the the external defibrillator there are also implanted defibrillators available. Only a medical professional can advise you what is best. There is a definite advantage to the implanted defibrillators in that they act automatically without the immediate intervention of another person.
