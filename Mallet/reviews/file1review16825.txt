review/text: Recently researchers found that high fiber consumption, especially from beans and cereals, is linked to longevity. A recent article in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition said that fiber provides cardiovascular protection and can lower the risk of heart disease. Yet nearly half of all Americans do not consume the RDA for fiber, which is 28 to 34 mg for men and 22 to 28 mg for women.This very tasty cereal bar is therefore a good way to add fiber to one's diet. It contains 5 grams of dietary fiber and 4 grams of insoluable fiber. Insoluable fiber is important because it acts as a sponge in wiping cholesterol from the inside of your arteries, which if not wiped off can cause fats to get caught on the cholesterol's hooks. These fats in turn lead to arteriosclerosis or thickening of the artery walls.Another plus is that 70% of this tasty bar's ingredients are organic. Non-organic foods carry the risk of cancer-causing pesticides. In short, this is a high fiber food with 110 mg of sodium, that doesn't taste like cardboard but is delicious and flavor-packed!
