review/text: I am always wary of "dr. shcoll's" products as being nothing more than overblown marketing. I decided to give this item a try after reading a few of the positive reviews on this website ...I was surprised that they really do help! It is not a 'cure' (of course), and there is still an issue of nighttime pain, but these really, truly help when I wear them during the day. Give it a try.
