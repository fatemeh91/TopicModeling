review/text: The capsules smell strange, and when I see what the powder looks like inside the clear capsules, it's tiny flicks of orange in a mostly white powder substance.More importantly, since these pills are NOT cheap, it is advertised as if each capsule IS the 600mg dose, where as in fact, you need 2 capsules to get the 600mg, so there's actually 50 servings. Very deceiving!Haven't noticed any change for this past few weeks, and will not order again.
