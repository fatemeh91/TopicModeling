review/text: These are a joke. They shred constantly and require way more floss than the regular kind. It feels like you are just pulling out tons of extra floss, trying to get it to stay, having it shred, repeat. I bought these from Drugstore (an unnecessary 5-pack!), hoping they'd be comparable to the Glide Crest Flosser that they are replacing. They don't even deserve a star. What a waste!
