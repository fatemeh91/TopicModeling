review/text: I needed a trimmer to take with me for traveling and this product did not disappoint. It caught my eye due to the price but it is of a solid construction material that I do not expect to break in my luggage. Do not get me wrong, I don't expect it to survive much abuse by dropping it.The trimming experience is adequate. This has really saved me time in the mornings, but I would have liked the closest setting to be a bit closer of a shave. I do make sure to take the head off and clean out any hair that may collect every week, so i am not sure what a lack of maintenance may do to its performance and life span. Power retention may not be as great as higher end models, but for the price I can handle plugging it in every few weeks.If you are looking for a affordable trimmer that you would not rage over losing or breaking and still performs well, consider trying this product.
