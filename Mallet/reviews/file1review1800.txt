review/text: My boyfriend's jock itch affliction had gotten to the point where he was constantly sneaking behind bushes or disappearing into hidden alleyways because he was desperate for a good scratching. Of course, scratching temporarily provides relief but the end result of incessant scratching is usually a full blown rash. I bought FungaSoap because the key ingredient is tea tree oil, which has anti-fungal/anti-bacterial properties. Now my boyfriend swears by it and can't get enough of the "refreshing sensation." Using the FungaSoap with a decent anti-fungal cream has worked wonders. I had to order the larger size because he likes to use it as a body wash as well.For jock itch, his routine is as follows... Pour a quarter-sized amount in your palm, then massage it into the affected area(s). Really work it in until it gets sudsy. Try to use the soap at least twice a day. My boyfriend will use it during his morning shower then have a quick body rinse after he gets home from work. Rinse and dry thoroughly then apply a fast-absorbing anti-fungal cream like Lotrimin AF. Doesn't matter if it's marketed as a foot fungal treatment as long as it has the anti-fungal ingredient clotrimazole. In fact, the foot treatments are generally cheaper than those advertised for jock itch but it's practically the same thing. Cheaper products with mineral oil as the base don't work as good because petroleum by-products trap moisture on the skin and fungus thrives on moisture! No matter what you use, be sure to rub in the treatment until the cream disappears. Afterward, try to keep afflicted area clean and dry as possible i.e. no nut-hugging underwear and/or tight hipster jeans. Give your jock and nuts space to breathe! Hope this helps.
