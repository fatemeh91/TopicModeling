review/text: This does do a good, fast job of removing hair but has a couple of drawbacks:1. The cord comes out of the side which makes it very awkward to hold and since it's quite small it's hard to get a good comfortable grip without fear of catching your fingertips in it. It takes a lot of practice.2. The two rolls of tweezers make for fast removal, but if you don't hold the skin really taut it's very easy to get pinched since the rollers roll inward towards each other. You need one hand to hold the machine and if you try to do your underarms you really have no other hand to hold the skin taut. I gave up using it there as I got pinched a few times.3. The brush they give you to clean it doesn't work well. It gets stuck between the tweezers. I use an old toothbrush instead with better results.4. Like most of them you can't use it on your face. I had to buy a separate one for that. I wish they would make a good all-in-one.I'm surprised at these problems as Emjoi usually makes a good product. I think I would go back to Norellco Satinelle or Braun Silk Epil.
