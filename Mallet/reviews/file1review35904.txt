review/text: I have autoimmune problems and my sinuses were a real mess. I couldn't breathe hardly at all and I was constantly reaching for tissues. With the Activated Quercitin I can get some air in and I'm not constantly reaching for tissues. Anti-histimines and decongestants deal with the problem after it has happened and I've had a number of side effects from them. I've had no side effect from Activated Quercitin, and it helps prevent the histimine reaction from occurring in the first place. I'm not symptom-free, but I'm MUCH better, and I've gotten more relief from Activated Quercitin than anything else I've tried.
