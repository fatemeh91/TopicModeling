review/text: The blades that were provided were poor. They seemed like they were refurbished and felt like shaving with a toothed sawblade. Terrible and of course they are now not returnable since I opened to try them. Tried three blades and all were poor quality. I have used Fusion blades from other stores and they have been fine but not these!!
