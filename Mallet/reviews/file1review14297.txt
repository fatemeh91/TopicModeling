review/text: I have been using the Norelco 7775X for about a year and three months now and it is a great product. When it came time to get replacement blades I could not find them anywhere so I looked on Amazon and sure enough they had some. I think the price is good and they work in my razor perfectly. I would recommend them to anyone who needs them.
