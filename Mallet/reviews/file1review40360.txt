review/text: Every time I get a cold, the first thing that relatives tell me is to take echinacea (and/or zinc) to prevent its onset. I have tried zinc, which in the end proved to give me severe migranes and make me sicker than the cold itself.But, I'm always willing to give natural cures a second try. I thought this was the perfect opportunity to try out the Gaia Herbs 20-capsule Quick Defense that I received recently.The Gaia Quick Defense has Echinacea, Ginger Root and Elderberry. Supposedly, echinacea is supposed to be good at boosting the immune system, especially when fighting colds.But it didn't work for me. Unfortunately, when I took this at the onset of a cold, it did not stop my cold from developing. In fact, I ended up losing my voice for a few days.Sadly, my search for a better, more natural way to cure a cold continues. Until then, I'll stick with my Dayquil and Nyquil.
