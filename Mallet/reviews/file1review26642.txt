review/text: I have to sit for hours at the computer to do my work, and my lower back has been bothering me on and off for years. I tried the Back Booster at the suggestion of a friend, and it is GREAT! It is easy to inflate and deflate when I move around to another location. The packaging is nice and fits in my purse. I have gotten more to give to other friends with similar problems as well.
