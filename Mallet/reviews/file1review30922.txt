review/text: I take them 3 times a day- 2drops at a time. I am so much more productive and energetic! I tell everyone about how much they have helped me get motivated to go to the gym, clean my house and some days just get out of bed! They don't have the best taste but what vitamins do??? I find the best thing to get the taste out of my mouth is to drink a Coke Zero or green tea- anything but milk and water should do the trick as well. I am afraid to try another brand because I am sooooo happy with the results I get from these. I only gave 2 stars on my first review b/c I couldn't get past the taste but the more I used them the more I found I didn't care how they tasted b/c the results were worth it!! And after a few uses I got used to the taste and they don't bother me as much!! They really don't taste bad just not great!!!
