review/text: I have dry mouth due to radiation treatment for head and neck cancer. The OralBalance gel helps me to sleep as many as 6 hours straight without waking up due to dry mouth pain. The taste seems neutral to me, but I don't have much sense of taste at the moment. It is a bit like sticking pnut butter to the roof of your mouth, spreading it out evenly with your tongue, and then leaving it there. The gel breaks down a little at a time and keeps your mouth nice and moist. If you have a dry throat, this can help a little bit, since you get some wetness to swallow every so often. Sometimes I still need a swallow of water to wet down the throat. Overall I am very happy with the product and am grateful for the improvement in my quantity and quality of sleep. My only complaint is I kinda wish it was available in a larger size!
