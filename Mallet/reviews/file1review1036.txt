review/text: I take this daily and it seems to have assisted with my acne and other health complaints. A higher dose helped considerably with the common cold (along with taking Vitamin C and garlic); the extra immune system boost helped me get over it within 2 days as opposed to the usual 5 with garlic/C. I cut one vcap open to help with a cystic acne spot that was bothering me. I rubbed the oregano ointment on the skin, let it sit overnight covered with a bandage, and the spot had shrunk considerably by morning. Is this the placebo effect in action? Perhaps, but I don't see the harm in using it if this is the case. At least it seems to help.
