review/text: We have a high iron content in our water. So our porcelain sinks and tub tend to turn yellow. I am also a life long asthmatic. I have been searching for a product that cleans well and doesn't effect my breathing. This product removed most of the yellow staining. However, I found the Lemon Verbena fragrance overpowering. I haven't tried the other two fragrances yet. So, my search continues. Perhaps one day Mrs Meyers would consider one without a fragrance.
