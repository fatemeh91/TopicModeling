review/text: I've been taking krill supplements for well over a year. I decided to try TwinLabs Cardio Krill Oil seeing it was on sale and it just doesn't compare to other krill oil I have had..same dosage etc. Also in most stores to buy otc it's almost $40! Amazon had a great price but it's not worth it even at a discount. The capsules smell and my hands need to be washed afterwards because they stink from touching the capsules. I question the quality because I don't feel that sense of "lift" & well being that I did with other krill oil supplements. I will now only purchase Source Naturals Krill Oil, it is an excellent quality product, small capsule and zero smell, plus they list the content of astaxanthin which is found in krill oil and not even mentioned on the Twin Labs Cardio Krill. Don't waste your money, or if you did try Source Naturals Arctic Krill, it's amazing!!
