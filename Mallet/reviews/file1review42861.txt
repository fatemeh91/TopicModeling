review/text: Pros:Apparently effective at increasing histamine, at least in the stomach. This in turn stimulates acid production, which is usually the reason people take histadine. Tablets don't fall apart before you finish the bottle. Not very expensive considering the scarcity of histadine supplements on the market.Cons:I noticed no change other than acid indigestion and exacerbation of my ulcer.Other thoughts:I take medications which are known to decrease histamine in the brain. Histamine is implicated in learning and memory. Over the years I have taken these medications I have noticed my memory and concentration decreasing. I was hoping taking histadine, which is a precursor to histamine, would improve my thinking ability. However, I noticed no change in this respect. I also hoped it might decrease my appetite, which the medications also increase. It didn't do this either. I only took it for 4 months, so maybe it wasn't enough time. Still I would not recommend it for anything else than explained in the next paragraph.On the other hand it did give me constant acid indigestion and made my ulcer come back (bad idea to take it in the first place). The common reason people take histadine is to increase stomach acid, so it is effective for this. Really effective, for me. However, because of the potential damage to one's stomach, I would recommend not taking histadine unless you have been diagnosed with low stomach acid for whatever reason, and need to increase it.So you may be wondering why I gave this product five stars, when it didn't do what I was hoping it would? Well, the bottle and store page made no claims about histadine's usefulness. In fact, the bottle said only, "Histadine is an amino acid." The only explicit reason I could find on-line for taking histadine was to increase histamine in the stomach and thus increase stomach acid, which it did. Therefore, I judge the product effective for its common use. Just don't take it for anything else.
