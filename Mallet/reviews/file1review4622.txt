review/text: I have to shave every day. This is not a good shave. It is very uncomfortable on the skin. The Mach 3 is a much better shave. I tested both for several months, each one for a week or so. Each one is the power handle which definitely helps. The fusion is rough on the skin, I even received nicks on my skin. I don't know why this is. Don't waist your money and time. I tested them for several months because I thought more blades would be better but are not in this case.
