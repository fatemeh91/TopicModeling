review/text: The first other-brand environmental friendly dishwasher soap I tried not only failed to clean the glasses it left a white crusty film in the walls and filter of the machine.My girlfriend turned me on to Seventh Generation after she had already done all the brand comparisons. I love that the glasses and dishes are sparkling and that they have no chemical odor, in fact no odor whatsoever.This one does work!
