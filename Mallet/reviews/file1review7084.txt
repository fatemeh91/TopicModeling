review/text: After years of rebuilding my System 4000 shavers, I decided to break down and get a new unit as the cost for replacement parts this time were so close to the Amazon price for the new model. Still has the feature I like most of the electric shavers I've used, the different foil heads. I've tried other brands and still kept with the System 4000 for the better shave I get with the close and super-close foil heads. With the new model the shape is easier to hold and I think it is a little lighter. Seems that the cutters and foil heads are identical to the old in design, but then if they work why change right? This one isn't made with too many 'customer serviceable' components like the older version. Its ability to work corded is better than the 4000 model. The models I had of those were dead if the battery was dead, and wouldn't work plugged in until the battery was charged. It is overall still worthy of checking out if you're looking for a really good shaver.
