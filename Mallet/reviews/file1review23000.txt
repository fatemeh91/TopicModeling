review/text: As a mom of two I have tried many products. I was thrilled to finally find one that worked, wasn't overpriced, and didn't have all the bad ingredients found in many baby care products. The travel pack is a perfect introduction to these wonderful products. Plus, they last forever and the adorable packaging makes them a great gift. My kids are sensitive and this stuff is so gentle on their little baby skin.
