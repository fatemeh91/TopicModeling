review/text: My 2-year old son has started a day care recently.And he started to get sick every other week. I was looking around to find something to pick up his immunity. It's hard to find anything without the corn ingredients, to which my son has allergy. Finally i found this line ChildLife.I called them and they assure me that there are no corn ingredients.So i bought it.We finished the first bottle.Right on the last day he got sick.Some virus.But this time we were done in 1.5 days.So i would say it works,not 100 %,but certainly improves things.It has pleasant taste,he took it with no problem/My only complain- something wrong with the bottle itself.Every time you pouring the liquid some amount goes on to label.So by the end all label was dirty. And i was trying hard to save every drop of this pretty expensive medication.Price here is much lower than in my neighborhood nature pharmacy.
