review/text: This is a great deal for $14.40 on the "Subscribe and Save" w/Prime.I freeze banana's and make a real shake. Use about 5 frozen banana's/w 3 dips of Slim Fast and fat free milk.Makes my mouth waters thinking about it.Banana's must be very ripe and frozen and milk must be cold to get that frosty cold milk shake affect.I am buying the bananas by the case and letting them ripen to a very ripe state before peeling them and then freezing them.
