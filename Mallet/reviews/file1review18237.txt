review/text: So I have really bad anxiety and it causes extreme nausea and I went for a couple months of non-stop nausea right after eating and eventually all I would eat was club crackers and vitamin water and even then my stomach would get upset. I went to a gastroenterologist and he wanted to do all these invasive tests and stuff and I wasn't for it, so he recommended me trying this before we went further. I don't know if it was the placebo effect that I wanted this to work so well that I didn't have to do the other procedures, but it worked right away! I took it for a couple of days and found my stomach relaxed even with some minor anxiety. I started to eat again with bland foods and I found little to no nausea anymore. Now whenever I start getting the nausea after every meal symptom, I take this for a couple of days and then I'm all better.My friend had hip surgery and she was really nauseous and constipated from all the drugs and everything and she was trying all these remedies, so I gave her the rest of my bottle (I bought a new bottle later on for myself) and she said it worked so well for her! She had surgery on her other hip about a month later and she is using it this time too for the nausea and constipation and she says it really makes a difference. I was so glad to have helped her!Anyways, sorry for the super long review, but I just have good things to say about Pepogest. I would definitely recommend it to more friends as I have already done so.
