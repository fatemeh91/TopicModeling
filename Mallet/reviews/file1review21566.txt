review/text: First, I had a hard time finding air filters in this size (24 x 30 x 1). They were not available at Home Depot, Lowes, Walmart, or Target. Home Depot said they could special order them for me and it would cost double what I paid for these filters. I received this set of filters on time and at a great price. They are not the cheap filters either. I like them because they are sturdy and have an arrow indicating the direction of the air flow to help when installing them. I bought these on Amazon and didn't pay shipping. It was great to find this product with no more running around and have it delivered to my door. Great product, price, and easies way to shop, in the convenience of my home.
