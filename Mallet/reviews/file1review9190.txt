review/text: The size is perfect for all my meds and supplements, I love the way they fit into the tray, perfect because I travel alot, however I think sometimes they tend to open on their own. My preference would be that they open on the opposite side but that's because all the others I own open on the right side and I am continually trying to open like all my other pill boxes.
