review/text: A FEW YEARS BACK I HAD A PAIR OF ALL SILVER REVLON TWEEZERS THAT WERE MY FAVORITE, BUT I LOST THEM. EVER SINCE I'VE BEEN TRYING DIFFERENT REVLON TWEEZERS SINCE I HAVEN'T SEEN THE SAME ONES EVER SINCE. I BOUGHT A PAIR THAT LOOKED GOOD JUST A COUPLE MONTHS AGO, BUT THEY WEREN'T VERY SHARP AND ARE ALREADY WORN OUT. THIS PAIR OF TWEEZERS ARE RIGHT UP THERE WITH THE REVLON ONES, BUT ONLY BETTER BECAUSE THEY ARE MADE OF STAINLESS STEEL. THEY ARE REALLY STARP AND GET EVEN HAIRS THAT LOOK LIKE THEY'D BE HARD TO GRAB. I LOVE THESE AND I'M PLANNING ON GETTING THE LARGER SIZED ONES IN THE NEAR FUTURE JUST TO HAVE AN EXTRA PAIR. TOTALLY WORTH PAYING ALMOST TWICE AS MUCH AS OTHERS SINCE LAST FEW PAIRS I'VE BOUGHT DON'T WORK NEARLY AS WELL AND GET SO WORN THAT THEY HAVE TO BE REPLACED WITHIN A FEW MONTHS.
