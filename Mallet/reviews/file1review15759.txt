review/text: I've bought 2 Tech 3 pens 2 years ago. The weight, multifunctional , and durability are exceptionally good. The problem is with the refills. It seems the original ink that came with the pen have markings FJ 0807 ISO 12757-2D and it was likely made in Japan; the black and red colors were consistent, brilliant, and dark.The refills didn't have these markings. The black and red had inconsistent streaks that were lighter; these refills are junk like they were made for $1 disposable pens and\or made in China. I used these pens for taking notes to scan and the deep vivid streaks are vital. I would pay more for the original refills.
