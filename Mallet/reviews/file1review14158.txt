review/text: I just bought the 7735X Norelco electric shaver, and it's the best shaver investment I have made yet. The ability to dispense the lotion directly from the shaver is great, and the closeness of the shave is amazing. The best part is that it does this with little to no irritation unlike my past electric shavers. I highly recommend these lotion cartridges to anyone who has these shavers!!!
