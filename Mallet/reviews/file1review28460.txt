review/text: It tastes good with sugar and I haven't had any side effects. At least not that I know of. The only problem is that over time the powder gets harder to mix completely with hot water. They'll be a few chunks of undissolved powder floating around your cup of whey. A blender or some sort of mixer can be used obviously to overcome this. Also check the cholesterol levels on this one, it's comparatively high.
