review/text: I wouldn't say that I have been obsessed, but maybe something close to but not necessarily obsession as far as skincare goes. So, I have tried a lot of different products along the way. Dermalogica special cleansing gel is hands down the best facial cleanser to date. Skincare 101...do not put any product on your face that contains perfume and soap free cleanser is best--this product meets both of those criteria. Your skin will be clean but not stripped. You will notice the difference the first time you use this product.
