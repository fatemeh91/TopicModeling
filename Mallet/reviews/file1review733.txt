review/text: My son used this to help build up nasal membranes and it has helped cut down on nose -bleeds markedly. The only negative is that these are a fairly significant sized capsule which some might have difficulty swalloing and though my 10 year old takes them with ease, I know I would personally find them a bit daunting
