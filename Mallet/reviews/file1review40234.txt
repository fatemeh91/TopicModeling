review/text: 1 of the tubes was smashed and they were going to send me another tube. After I posted my comments I recieved many phone calls from someone (1 was after I went to bed) and some were at dinnertime! It turns out all they wanted was for me to remove my feedback and they gave me a $2 refund for the smashed tube I really wanted the toothpaste which is what they said they were going to do when I called them, but it was asking too much I guess! The bottom line is I recieved a lot of phone calls (at inappropriate times) and I could hardly understand what the gentleman was saying as his english was not too good.
