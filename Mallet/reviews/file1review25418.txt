review/text: You should think about using eye-watering tweezers rather than buy this product. I gave up using it after the first few attempts because, amazingly, it doesn't cut hair! You spend 5 minutes trying to align each hair so that it will enter the nozzle at the right angle to cut. Even then, the blades tend to push the hairs out of the way rather than cut them. It even managed to scratch the inside of my nose because I was pushing too hard to make it work. A bit of a design flaw for a hair trimmer!
