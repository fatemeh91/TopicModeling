review/text: I had an Oral-B battery powered flosser, but it broke, I bought it three or four years ago and loved it because you get the little forked floss between your teeth, you push the button and the floss vibrates between your teeth. I went back to a food store where I bought it off the shelves and it was not there. I looked then at major retail stores in the dental section and no one seemed to carry it. Indeed, no one seemed to know about it. I searched on Amazon, found the product, and bought two of them. It' was only $14 for two of them, including shipping. Flossing made easy...and you get to hear a hummingbird!
