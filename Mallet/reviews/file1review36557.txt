review/text: My husband told me about gentian violet being used both in WWI and WWII. Used to treat wounded soldiers.....and soldiers who had been 'indiscreet'. That was good enough recommedation for me. BE CAREFUL, YES IT DOES STAIN. Otherwise, do some research and find out more about gentian violet. I wouldn't want to be without it.
