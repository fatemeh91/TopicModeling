review/text: Although not rocket science, sometimes a simple device can make life much more accommodating to elders. This is such a device. When the legs and back no longer flex as they did in younger days this aid is a boon to assist one putting on a sock or stocking. Most days I don't need it, but on that occasional stiff day it is invaluable. Works well, too soon to tell how well it will hold up to continued use.
