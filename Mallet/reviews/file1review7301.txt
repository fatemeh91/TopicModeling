review/text: I purchased the foot bath because I am started to listen to all my aches and pains that my body is telling me and thought I am going to take care of myself because I do not want to fall apart at 42. I received my foot bath and was so excited. I used it 4 times and was real happy since I am on my feet all day. Well, sad to say that the heat and the massage no longer work. I tried plugging it in to different outlets thinking or hoping it was the outlet. I did not use any salts or oils like they advise you not to do. I was going to return it but it states that I cannot return this item do to sanitary reasons. Please do NOT purchase this item. It would have been a lot cheaper for me to just use a bucket of water to soak my feet.
