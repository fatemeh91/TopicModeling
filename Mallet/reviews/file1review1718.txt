review/text: I have been suffering from tenia versicolor and acne on my back for almost 10 years. I have tried many products: ketoconazol orally and in shampoo, antibiotics, Hibicleans, selsum blue etc. I have been using Fungasoap for the last 6 monts with good results. It provides similar results than the ketoconazol 2% shampoo but it does dry my skin. The acne on my back is gone. The tenia versicolor is not completely gone but it is not very noticeable. I like this product because is from natural extracts. it does not dry my skin. The only bad thing is that it irritate my eyes. I need to close my eyes when I use it.I use it almost every day. I let the shampoo stay on my skin for few minutes. In my case it took a month to see noticeable results with this product.
