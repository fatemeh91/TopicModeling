review/text: I took a sperm test a while back after months of trying to get my wife pregnant, while the test came back slightly low or at the borderline. I had to deploy for 4 months, I started taking this and the sperm motility boost the last 2 months before I got home, my wife conceived 2 weeks after I got home. It's a vitamin and does help. It definetly did its job!
