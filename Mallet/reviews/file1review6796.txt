review/text: helps relieve painful stressful tension in the back, hips, down the legs etc.quite handy to have around when you need to get to a sore spot and to press on acupuncture points. the only reason i gave it a four instead of a five was if it had one area that i could use as a scratcher, then it would be a five....
