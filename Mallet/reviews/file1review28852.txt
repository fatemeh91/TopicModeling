review/text: I was pretty happy with the Double Rich Chocolate flavor, so I decided to branch out slightly into Extreme Milk Chocolate, unaware that Ashton Kutcher was waiting in the next room to run out and yell "Sucralose'd!!!" The sweetener is overwhelming and gross, (Double Rich Chocolate doesn't have it). The website has no indication which flavors have sucralose and which use other sweeteners, so I'm afraid to try any other new variations. If anyone can report other non-sucralose flavors, I'd greatly appreciate it.
