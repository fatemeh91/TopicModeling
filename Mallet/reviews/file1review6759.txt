review/text: I have been getting regular massages for the past 10 something years. Well, not as regularly as I would like, given my budget, but I try to go at least once a month. My main problem is the tight muscles in my neck and shoulders. I have literally begged my friends and hubby to just pound my shoulder area as hard as they can to try and loosen the pressure.When I finally broke down and bought one of these, mostly based on the reviews on here, I had low expectations. I couldn't figure out how it worked based on the pictures. How could the leverge possibly create enough pressure to really get IN to the muscle like I needed? Boy am I glad I gave it a try. Yes it looks weird. Yes it doesn't make sense (at least to me). But if you play around with it you will fall in love. I go into a trance when I use it. I'm FINALLY able to hit the exact spots I want hit, and hit them as hard as I want. It's absolutely amazing. And after I do my shoulders and back I go to my feet. Pure heaven. Can't say enough!
