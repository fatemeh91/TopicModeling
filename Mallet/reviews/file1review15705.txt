review/text: I used the Rainbow Light Menopause One and my hot flashes actually stopped. I started around late August 2010, It took about 4 to 6 weeks to see' results. I took 1 vitamin each day and I saw a decline in the hot flashes each day, until one day I realized I did not have any hot flashes. The effects may vary from one person to another. I took the vitamins with my breakfast.These vitamins do no bring instant relief, but rather a gradual change. I contacted the Rainbow light company and they responded with the reply to my question as to how long does it takes to see results and they were right, it took about 4 to 6 weeks. All natural ingredients.
