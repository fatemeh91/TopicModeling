review/text: ...but this worked great for me!! My dog has an infection on his front leg that stinks to high heavens when he pulls the bandage off. I never thought I'd get rid of the dog smell in the carpet from it, but Bissell's cleaner worked so good I was actually able to get on my hands and knees without smelling it at all! Wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't shampooed the carpet myself...Am going to get some more tomorrow and do my couches. Would highly recommend (and I have TWO dogs).
