review/text: I use this to wash out my thermos or tumblers. When I drink coffee I usually add a little chocolate powder, so if I don't end up finishing my cup it stays at the bottom or it can get on the sides and that can be a pain. This brush helps a lot. It reaches where a normal sponge can't and it cleans it well.
