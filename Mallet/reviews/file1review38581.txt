review/text: I recommend this First Aid Kit for its completeness and its organization. It has first aid items that will come in handy for most minor injuries. The clear plastic dividers make it easier to find what you are searching for. I wish that it had a tube of ointment for cuts and burns instead of the small packages. I augmented my first aid kit with saline solution and Glucose for personal needs.
