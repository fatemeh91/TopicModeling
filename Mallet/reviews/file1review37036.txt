review/text: I've tried just about all the different deodorants on the market and have always gravitated back to Right Guard. This powder spray was really nice and didn't leave sticky stuff under my arms. Some do and you can't take off your shirt and feel relaxed cause you never know. I'll continue to buy this and feel confident I can use it through the summer... Very good product.
