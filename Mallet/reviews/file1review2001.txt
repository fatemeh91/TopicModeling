review/text: PVC is a porous material, first of all. You'll never get it disinfected or sanitized. Secondly, that paint will come off over time. Where do you think it's going? Third, this type of material contains phthalates, which are potentially dangerous and can cause allergic reactions in some people, phthalates have also been shown to cause cancer. Please choose something else that is NOT PVC, Jelly, Rubber, Vinyl.
