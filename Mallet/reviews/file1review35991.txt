review/text: This stuff tastes awful. Recently they came out with those things you squirt into water to flavor the water and I am using those things to flavor it when I drink it. I mix the L-Arginine with water and put the squirt flavor in. It improves the taste, does not make it taste good so I still make faces drinking it, but, at least I don't want to puke.
