review/text: I love having my medicine organized for each day. I can take the little pod with me to take meds as needed. I do wish the little pods were slightly sturdier - if you open the lid all the way while refilling them, they kind of tip backwards because there isn't enough weight to keep them stable. This issue is solved by not opening the lids entirely back - just hinge them all open a bit, refill for the week, and they should stay upright. Also great for travel!
