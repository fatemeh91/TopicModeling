review/text: I have struggled off and on with sniffles and flu symptoms since I had my son 4 years ago. And, I would often have to stay home from work at least once per month nursing the body aches, sore throat, headache, and general discomfort. I was starting to think nothing would work. However, I swear by this stuff now.I tried this product a year ago when I was pregnant with my daughter. I was extremely disappointed because I thought it didn't work. Well, that's because I took it for a viral infection well after the onset of the bug.A few months later, my husband and I had sore throats and we both took a few doses of these immediately at the onset of the flu symptoms. Honestly, it worked so well that we were well but both of our little ones were sick. This never happens. Anyone with children knows that if the kids are sick, the whole household gets sick.I tend work myself really hard which only perpetuates sickness. And now, with two little ones, I don't take care of myself like I should. But, since I have gotten these, I don't get sick anymore. Period. I might have a sore throat for a day but it never gets beyond that because I take these at the onset. No more sneezing and coughing or sniffles. I keep them in my purse and take them as needed. Which isn't very often. But, I have only taken one sick day this year as opposed to previously when I would take at least one per month.I would totally recommend this product to anyone who struggles with frequent sniffles and flu-like symptoms like I used to. I have been able to take them while nursing my daughter with no impact to her since they are homeopathic. There are no drowsy side effects. And, I actually feel more energetic after I take them. And, I get the flu-shot every year but a friend of mine who is a licensed doctor never gets the flu shot and only takes these. This price is the cheapest I have found. Its a great buy.Get the industrial size since you'll want to have them on hand immediately.
