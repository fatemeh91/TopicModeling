review/text: I don't eat this. I use it on my skin and in my hair. It is great for locs as it is a light-weight conditioner and has a subtle coconut scent that quickly dissipates. It won't weight your hair down, make it hard; or, get kind of rancid like castor oil can. It was fresh and well packed. I recommend it as a great natural softening product for hair and skin, especially right after a bath/shampoo.
