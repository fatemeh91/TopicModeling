review/text: I just bought this and am impressed with the price. I have used Borion products before and they WORK. I do not have health insurance and have to be my own doctor. I find these save me lots of $$$ as they work for most symptoms. I like the one for hot flashes it works! The price is very good as just one treatment costs around $6.00 each plus you get this nice storage case too.
