review/text: My mother has dificulty getting into cars. My Honda Element has a grabg bar above and to the right of the passenger seat. She uses it but it is slightly too high and slightly too far back to be optimal. I attached the CarCaddie to the grab bar. I tied a couple of elaborate knots in it and when she pulls down on it the knots tighten.I broke the buckle while I was fiddling around with the Caddy (my fault). But it isn't needed for this appplication anyway.
