review/text: This item might have been okay, but it did not fit my boyfriend. He has bad degenerative neck disease and I thought this would help keeping his neck warm. I should have been wary of the one size fits all aspect of this product. The true problem is that I attempted to contact the company in the manner and within the time frame that they wished for to be able to return this AND never got a response back. Anybody want to have it for free? It is of zero use to us.Maria
