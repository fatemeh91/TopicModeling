review/text: I had to buy this on Amazon because I can't find it in the stores. It's available as a liquid in stores, but liquid detergents are just way too messy. This product does a great cleaning job and is easy on sensitive skin. I also buy it for my elderly parents for their sensitive skin. Contrary to other reviews that say it won't dissolve in cold water, I find that it works in any water temperature & I use only cold water in the summer. Wish this product were easier to find.
