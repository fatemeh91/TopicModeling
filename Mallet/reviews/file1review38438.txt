review/text: First let me say I have very dark, very coarse leg hair and even after shaving you can still see the hair on my legs and a couple hours after, it is already prickly again. So this product does work with coarse hair...I'm not sure about fine hair. Anyways, I hated it so much, and started waxing. I then began to hate that...letting your hair get that long stinks, and $50 a visit began to drive me crazy! After doing some research I decided to invest in this product and have never been happier. I received it a little over a week ago and my first experience with it was painful. Let me tell you, the first time you use it, it kills! This may be because I have such coarse hair though. After thinking about it, I also think it is the same pain level as waxing, however, it seems worse at the time because you are doing it to yourself and can stop and agonize over how much it hurts instead of someone just ripping away. Anyways...a week later...as with waxing you do have a very tiny bit of growth...not even noticable but I have always just glided a razor over it but it's not necessary. I just decided to use the epilator again real quick to get a little more growth that has started and it didn't even hurt. You just need to learn to pull your skin really really taught. The only negative is I found it very hard to get my knees, but I feel like I'll catch on soon enough. Also - if you've ever noticed, with waxing they usually start half way between your knees and ankle... do the same when epilating because it is much more sensitive around your ankles! So if you do experience a lot of pain during the first time...don't give up! Take it out again a week later and you'll be pleasantly surprised. Just don't let the growth get too thick again or else you'll go through the same amount of pain as you did the first time. By epilating every week that shouldn't happen.
