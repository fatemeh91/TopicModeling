review/text: I have used this product for years. It soothes arthritis, sore muscles and joints without the "Ben Gay" smell or feel. It takes a fraction of the amount you would use in the more popular brands and has a pleasing lemon scent. At night before bed I apply a small amount to an area in need and wake up feeling great.
