review/text: This is NOT a 9V battery. This is a 9V SIZE battery, but even at full charge only supplies a maximum of 7.2 volts. The reason for this is that NiMH cells provide a lower voltage than do alkaline cells, so you can't get exactly 9V BUT if Energizer had added 1 more cell, they could have gotten 8.4 volts which is very close. For some reason (most likely monetary) they decided to cut us out on 1.2 volts (I feel cheated as a customer--minus 1 star). In most cases, this isn't a problem (thus a rating higher than 1 or 2 stars) since devices that use batteries are made to work under a variety of voltages since batteries lose some voltage as they discharge BUT if you are running a sensitive device that turns off at a threshold at or above 7.2V, then these won't work for you (minus 1 star). Other brands offer 8.4 Volt 9V sized NiMH batteries. I suggest you go with one of those.
