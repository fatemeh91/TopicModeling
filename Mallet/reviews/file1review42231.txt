review/text: I am having a hard time remembering whether I took my prenatal vitamins or not, so I decided to get a handy pill box to help me keep track. I didn't want an old grandma looking one, so I was happy to find a cute little purse sized pill case. I love that the days of the week are labelled, but not in such an obvious way. each slot is big enough for my giant horse pills, and there's an extra container for storage that I can use for some tylenol, tums, or other things I may want to keep in there. If you need to take a lot of pills daily, I wouldn't reccomend this one, but for just a couple a day - its perfect! I haven't missed a vitamin this week!
