review/text: I bought this at my local health food store to boost my immune system. Last week, my husband got the flu. He still has it lingering (so it's been about a week and a half). When I came down with it a few days after him, I started taking 3 capsules a night, and I got totally over the virus within 3 days of taking it (4 days total), less than half the time it took my husband. But it smells and tastes AWFUL.
