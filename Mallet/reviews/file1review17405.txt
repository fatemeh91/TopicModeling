review/text: Even though I went through most of the reviews for this trimmer, I was skeptical about this. But finally I bought the trimmer and trimmed my beard which is 2 weeks old. Surprisingly, this worked like a charm...I fell in love with this trimmer after the first use...It didn't pull my beard at all. No rashes or any kinda problems. Above all for the price, I would strongly recommend this product with 5*****
