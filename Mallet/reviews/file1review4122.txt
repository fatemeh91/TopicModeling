review/text: i purchased this along with some other supplements meant to help with chronic fatigue due to fibromyalgia. like i told everyone, if i had to narrow it down to just 1 or 2 supplements and that's all i could afford, this would be on the list. i noticed a difference within a few days of taking it. i am still on the ultimate supplement search, but this was definitely worth the money.
