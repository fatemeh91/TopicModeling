review/text: My Wound Care Specialist gave me a bottle of 'SAF-Clens AF' to use before changing the dressings on my sensitive skin ulcers. This works well either sprayed directly on the skin or onto a gauze-sponge for cleaning the wound area.This is a gental clenser and does not have a strong scent or leave a residue.Highly recommended
