review/text: i bought this set of replacements on amazon and so far 2 of the 3 heads are useless after only 2-3 weeks use. for some reason, after i used the first head for a couple weeks, the head wouldn't spin anymore; it would just vibrate. i thought it was just one of the very few defective ones that i was unlucky to get so i threw it away. i opened a second one and the same thing happened after just about the same amount of time (2 weeks). the brush heads look like new still but it's very loose and all it does is vibrate, it doesn't spin. beware- do not buy these on amazon, buy them at your local walmart or target instead.
