review/text: The best thing about optimum's whey is it mixes without lumps on the other hand the flavors are a hit or miss. The strawberry banana flavor tasted great with milk as do the majority of the flavors but when strictly combined with water the chemical taste is overpowering.The chocolates and cookie and cream flavors I found to be fine in water but all the fruit flavors taste terrible. Strawberry banana and vanilla ice cream are undrinkable in water but fine in milk.
