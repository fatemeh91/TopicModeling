review/text: Last year I was diagnosed with peridontal disease. After the first root scaling, flossing became a very important part of preventing that from ever happening again. My hands do not fit in my mouth to easily floss all of the teeth without trying to stuff both hands in my mouth. These flossers are wonderful and work very well at dislodging food between the teeth. My hygenist commented on the rapid improvement I have had. As for throwing them away after each flossing, it isn't necessary. I rinse the head after use in hot water, and dip it into Listerine to sterilize it for the next use. I wait until the flost starts to self destruct before replacing. I do not replace my toothbrush after every single use, so I don't see a problem with this. A little common sense goes a long way.
