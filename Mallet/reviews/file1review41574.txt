review/text: I own the old 155XX series brush that was given to me about 6 years ago as a gift and have been using it until now. I just bought this new one since it's a new type of brush head. I must say that I like this one much better. For one thing, it's much quieter and faster at the same time. The larger brush body allowed them to put in a more powerful motor. It almost feels like they've incorporated the Sonic motor into this unit. The new brush head seems to work better at getting the plaque off also.The only drawback is the extra heft of the larger handle. I didn't really need the LCD display either. Many of the function could have been given by the way that the handle shakes or beeps to signal for different modes. That would have allowed them to remove the unnecessary display and reduce the weight a little. Instead of the the display, a simple single green/yellow/red LED would have been just as effective at letting us know if it needs to be recharged. Anyway, that would have been a smarter design.
