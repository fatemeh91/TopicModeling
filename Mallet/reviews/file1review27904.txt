review/text: I have consistenly been working out for the last three years and have tried just about every store bought whey protein, mass gainer, creatine and other suppliments out there. I've used this for the last 4 months and I think I found my new favorite suppliment. I use alittle more than the average serving, but mix it in 24ounces of milk with a bananna and a few other vitamins. I haven't changed up my workout schedule, but I notice a considerable gain......and its not just waterweight like creatine or other suppliments I have used. HIHGLY Recommend
