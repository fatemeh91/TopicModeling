review/text: Used this medical kit while traveling. I liked that it contained pretty much everything I needed. However I took off 1 star because I wish it had contained more antiseptic / antibiotic cream instead of the 4 packets that were inside. I also wish that it had more alcohol wipes for cleaning wounds and hands. I added these and a few more bandaids and believe that the kit is now very complete. Will use it for future traveling and hiking. The contents of the kit were not expired so had no issues with that.
