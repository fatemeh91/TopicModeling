review/text: My husband has sjogrens syndrome and wears contacts specifically designed to bathe the eyes continuously...this product was recommended by his specialist and has become very hard to find at a fair price. His contacts cover the entire eye surface and his cleaner has to not only be dependable but also gentle. We now order from Amazon when he needs more...thanks for carrying it!
