review/text: I am incredibly disappointed in Solgar and they have lost my business all together for their poor decision to add soy to this WHEY protein. I started buying Whey to Go 7.5 years ago after my previous whey protein started adding soy without any warning. That addition caused me to have a major reaction and land in the ER because I am highly allergic to soy. It's nearly impossible to find a good protein powder without soy. So, I found Whey to Go. I have been drinking at least three servings a day for nearly 8 years and have been dependent on this product to be one of my few options without soy. For many of us, soy is deadly and we NEED whey protein as a safe alternative. I can't believe Solgar started adding soy to this protein! It makes no sense. I couldn't find my usual 32 oz container in the stores for a while, then noticed that the smaller container said "new and improved." That is never a good sign, so I read the ingredients. Sure enough, there was soy. I checked the Solgar site and ALL of their whey proteins now have soy. If I wanted a soy protein, I'd buy a soy protein. But no, I want a pure WHEY protein, and Whey to Go is no longer safe for me.I am currently pregnant, so protein is more important than ever. I'm bummed that I have to go searching and experimenting with new proteins to find a product that won't kill me. What a terrible move to put soy in your whey protein Solgar! I was spending nearly $100 a month on this stuff, but never again will I support Solgar.
