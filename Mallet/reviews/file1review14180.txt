review/text: I've been using these creams for a long time, and seeing them available on amazon was a relief (especially with the subscribe-and-save option).This is the basic refill that helps a smooth (and non-painful) shave with Phillips products. It basically comes to not whether you'll buy the product, but where you'll obtain it. For myself, amazon is a good choice.
