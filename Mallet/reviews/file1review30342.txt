review/text: I noticed the following problem.The attachment (the front piece which contains rotating brush) that fixes to the handheld moves up and down while vacuuming a flat surface. It does not get fixed tightly. Therefore while vacuuming I had to make extra effort to keep this front part pressed against the floor while moving vacuum back and forth. I was vacuuming the stairs.Note:- The vacuum works as expected, however this is an annoying problem.
