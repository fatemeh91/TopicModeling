review/text: I bought this to use for my 3 year old daughter and it works great when she has accidents during the night. I use two to ensure she is covered during the night since she tends to roll around. I use it on a queen size bed and I have positioned it across the bed as opposed to up and down. I leave about a 3 inch overlap with the second one and my bed is covered no matter where my little girl rolls.
