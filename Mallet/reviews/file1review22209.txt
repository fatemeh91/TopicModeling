review/text: From packing sandwich for lunch to storing left-over, Ziploc is well-known for its variety of food storing products. I have been using the Ziploc brand containers since high school, and I must say this purchase from Amazon disappointed a lot. I'm not saying this is Amazon's fault, but I have also checked Ziploc products in retail stores like Wal-mart and Target; the quality of Ziploc went down and very down.One thing I hate the most, nowadays many companies say go GREEN by reducing the materials manufacturing their product. Yes, Ziploc is one of the case, and they make themselves look bad. People buy Ziploc because of their quality product likes sturdy plastic box and holding-firm lid. It's no longer a good product that I trust. The box bends in my lunch box leaving stretching lines which makes the lid hardly fits. The lid doesn't firmly snap to brand new container.By the time I'm writing this review, I have already switched to Rubbermaid. Ziploc now to me is just same as wal-mart brand product, Great Value.
