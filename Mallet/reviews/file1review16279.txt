review/text: I had better success with these convenient FINISH powerball tabs than with the Cascade product enclosed in the plastic casing which I tried before this. Cascade's plastic pouches leave a filmy-residue on my dishes, but the FINISH powerball tabs dissolve completely. I will continue to buy them because they also clean great! Five Stars!
