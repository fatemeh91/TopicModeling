review/text: A little background first: I was diagnosed with PCOS in the summer of 2009 after years (ever since I started getting my period at 13) of highly irregular cycles that range anywhere from 8 weeks and beyond. I got pregnant (with no drugs) in May of 2008 and miscarried late June of 2008 around 7 weeks. Started Clomid in August of 2009 and had 4 good regular cycles where I ovulated (out of 6 cycles) but the side effects were horrible and I didn't get pregnant. Stopped clomid in February 2010. Dr. recommends an HSG for me and for my husband to get a sperm analysis. Haven't got the HSG yet due to the high cost but will be getting a sperm analysis soon. Had to take some time off of everything pregnancy related for a few months to have 2 (painful!) kidney stone surgeries in the spring of this year.ANYHOOO, I was running out of hope and feeling defeated, especially since my insurance doesn't cover infertility issues. I started doing some online research and came across Fertilaid. I read about it, read the reviews, and thought about it for a while. Ordered my first bottle late last month and started taking it on day 9 of my current cycle. I ended up ovulating around day 20 which is good for me! Without any type of medications/supplements I don't ovulate anywhere near that soon in my cycle! I'm reaching the end of my cycle now and have the normal symptoms I get after I ovulate so I'm very excited! It's only my first month on Fertilaid so we'll see if it continues to help with ovulation in the months to come. I'll take a pregnancy test in a few days before I leave out of town. My fingers are crossed but I'm just glad it's helping with ovulation! BTW: I'm 26 years old now if anyone's wondering.
