review/text: I bought this because I have a pet rabbit who tracks wood shavings all over the carpet. This sweeper is great at picking up the relatively large pieces of wood shavings (and also rabbit poop). I love not having to vacuum every day to clean my carpet. I would definitely recommend this product.
