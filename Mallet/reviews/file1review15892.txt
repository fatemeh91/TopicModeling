review/text: this maternity support is the best of there kinds that are out there in the world! with 2 small children at home and #3 on the way i had already tryed the other kids of supports and belts THEY DIDNT work so we found this one and i thought i should try it.. I am going to use it after baby as well it feels great! helps with my feet hurting my lower back hurting my upper back and my sholders as well the only adjustment is when you are needing to sit down and get up its not very easy at all.. you have a adjust and get used to it then you get good at it..
