review/text: after carefull review of several brands and types of these I bought this on based on the reviews. dead -on! I'm glad I spent a little more because I feel like it is a good quality product.I just got it last night and I cant wait to get home and use it again tonight. I have a typeII ankle sprain and a high ankle sprain and have been wearing foot braces for months and this is just what I needed.Its not deep enough to cover my entire ankle, but for a guy with size 12 feet it is plenty big enough.this thing is huge! water temp got very warm and the jets worked great.
