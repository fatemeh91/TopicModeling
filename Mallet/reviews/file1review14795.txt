review/text: Citrate form of calcium and magnesium are highly absorbable. I like using the powder because I can adjust the amount provided in my multi-vitamin to ensure my total intake is in line with recommendations in "Prescription for Nutritional Healing". We blend this (along with calcium citrate powder and magnesium ascorbate powder and other supplements) into a homemade smoothie. Even when we blended it with plain orange juice the taste was totally fine (it just adds a bit of tang).
