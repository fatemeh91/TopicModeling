review/text: Assuming you believe that sulfur supplements are beneficial to maintaining joint health, Jarrow Formulas MSM 1000 is a good supplement choice.I do believe in the use of glucosamine and MSM 1000 for joint health. I find taking these regulalry helps relieve joint pain, and aids mobility.As with other Jarrow products, MSM 1000 is low on unnecessary fillers. The ingredient list is:* Methyl-Sulfonyl-MethaneOther ingredients are basically what it takes to make up the tablet: Cellulose, calcium carbonate, stearic acid (vegetable source), magnesium stearate (vegetable source), silicon dioxide and food grade coating.MSM 1000 contains no wheat, no gluten, no soybeans, no dairy, no egg, no fish/shellfish, no peanuts/tree nuts.Each tablet contains 1000mg of MSM. There are 120 tablets to a bottle. The suggested dose is 1 to 2 tablets per day. The tablets are "easy solv" which are designed to dissolve within several minutes of ingestion.To date, I have found Jarrow Formulas' products to be of high quality, comparable to some of the better known/trusted supplement brands.
