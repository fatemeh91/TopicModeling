review/text: Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Choc Malt, 5-pound TubThis is my Honest Opinion on "Optimum Nutrition whey Gold Choc Malt". First off i would like to say i have never had anything taste as great as this protein. Usually i am stuck with buying proteins that clam to taste great, (ex)"Unbelievable taste" is always written on the label... Oh, it's pretty unbelievable... Unbelievably nasty! Most protein shakes taste like straight donkey! Mix this baby with some Milk and a some ice all up in a blender and ta da, you have a great tasting malt (without all that nasty sugar of course, and less calories!)I have not tried any other ON's products but will soon when i have more money.
