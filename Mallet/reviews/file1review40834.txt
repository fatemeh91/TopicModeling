review/text: This razor has a curved handle which makes shaving my legs a breeze. It has snap on/snap off replaceable soap heads that last about a month (with 3 of us using it so it lasts a long time!) and it leaves my legs silky smooth. The cost for 3 replacement heads is around $8, so it is highly comparable to all the other womens razors out there...and I can use it on the run cuz the soap is built in! I highly recommend it to women!
