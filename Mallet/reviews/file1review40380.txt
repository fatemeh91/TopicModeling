review/text: I've been taking these capsules whenever I feel a little down, and so far I've escaped any major illness!However, it's hard to tell whether I'd actually have gotten sick, since I don't have a time machine or fortune teller's ball.But even a placebo effect is better than nothing, if just for peace of mind! If you're willing to spend the money, the herbs definitely won't hurt.
