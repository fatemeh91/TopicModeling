review/text: OkFor home its great. Never buy those store brand kits as all they have is band aidsFor hiking a few hours this kit will do.For over night trip, it will work for 1-2 person 1-2 nights. I wont rely on it if i am doing backpackers trip.But must have one in car, at home and at work. Really this thing can save lots of bleeding, pain and misery if you just read the book that it comes with and carry it with you on trips.Overall the best kit available for price, but a better kit is possible of course you gotta spend 2-3 times more.
