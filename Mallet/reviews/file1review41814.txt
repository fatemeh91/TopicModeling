review/text: I have had this Tooth Brush for 2 weeks now. I had previously used a Sonicare Inteliclean 8500. The Oral B in mind definitely cleans better than the Sonicare 8500. I can see it and I can feel it. The Sonicare Inteliclean uses a Crest tooth paste cartridge which is sort of neat but it makes it a lot more bulky and you have only one choice for a toothpaste. I have been using electric tooth brushes for a long time and the Oral B Triumph is the best I have ever used. Cannot go wrong here.
