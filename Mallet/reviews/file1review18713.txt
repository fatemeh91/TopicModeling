review/text: Got the chair for my dad whose older chair now looks like it's seen the WW II. The packaging inside and outside is quite weird, at first I even thought it was a return but it just seems to be the way they're manufactured.The chair itself is made of nice leather with a lot of padding, which is very important. There's also a very firm lumbar support for the back.The massager is OK, no vibration massage can compare to the Shiatsu one. It's rechargable and already comes with a full charge out the box. There are 3 preset modes plus the custom mode for specific areas. There are also 3 levels of massage. The massager only works if there's weight on the chair and turns off when you stand up to save battery.The chair has only 2 controls of any kind: the tilt lock that locks it in the upright position or allows it to swivel, and the tilt resistance, pretty standard for this price range.The chair is quite solid for the price, I would recommend it to others.
