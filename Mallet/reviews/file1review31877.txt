review/text: EDIT: I am editing my review. I will even leave up my initial review below so you can see how I USED to feel about this product. But I have just gotten my second bottle of this product, used it one morning and I am returning it. The new "version" of this lotion is no longer creamy smooth like it used to be. Also the fragrance of my first bottle that I loved was a nice mellow, earthy sandalwood. However this new bottle is a horrible perfumy over the top sandalwood fragrance. Even my wife was avoiding me the morning after I used this new bottle because it was so bad. So something major has changed with the product, and I will never use it again.----------- OLD REVIEW ----------This product is amazing as an after shave lotion. I used to use the after shave "lotion" which is more or less cologne that is full of alcohol, and I dreaded that part of my shave because of the burning and irritation that followed. I tried all kinds of "sensitive skin" products, but they all did nothing but irritate me. Then one day I was treated to a professional shave at a upscale barber for my birthday. I told the barber how sensitive my skin was, and he said, "don't worry, I got you covered." After the shave he put this AoS Sandalwood Lotion on my face, and I was amazed at how great my face felt afterwards. I left that day with my first bottle of this product, and I have not shaved without it since then.I do work from home ... so I don't shave but once or twice a week :) But this one bottle has lasted me almost 1.5 years. After each shave I squirt the bottle into my hand four times, in four little dots of lotion. One for each cheek, and two for my neck (one under each cheek). That small amount is all I need to fully cover my face and soothe any razor burns. It might seem a little on the expensive side for one bottle, but a little goes a long way and has lasted me 1.5 years.
