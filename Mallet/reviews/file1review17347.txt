review/text: I owned another Remmington beard trimmer for about 10 years and it was a good trimmer - solid construction, easy to take apart and clean. This model is a newer version of the same trimmer. The new trimmer works well but the adjustment of the attachment is not as good as the old one - it feels cheaper to me. Otherwise this is a good trimmer.
