review/text: I got this to try since I am a huge fan of OXO Products. Maybe I am just being "dumb" but when I screwed off the top there was a small hole to put in my favorite liquid detergent and it made a huge mess. When I am scrubbing dishes that can't go in the dishwasher the brissels are not that strong. Even when I don't push the top liquid detergent still comes out which means I can't use the brush throughout the time I am cleaning otherwise there will always be soap. Also, there is no "center spike" to help remove "caked on" grease like other brushes I have used in the past. I would highly recommend the Libman Kitchen Brush [Curved] with small handle which is the one I will continue to use.
