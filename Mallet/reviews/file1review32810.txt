review/text: I like the flavor of this much better than the chocolate... plus, adding fruit and/or yogurt to the drink adds to the volume and helps fill me up so I'm not snacking on the stuff that I'm not supposed to be snacking on. I've added this directly to non-flavored yogurt, too. IMHO, it makes it easier to want to substitute this for the fattening snacks... almost like a dessert.
