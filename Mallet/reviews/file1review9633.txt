review/text: I started using this years ago and ever since then I have recommended it to MANY people who now swear by it as well. I'm a teacher and in the winter washing my hands so much leads to severe, bleeding cracked hands. The oil is MUCH better than the cream (the cream doesn't really help me much). I just put it on at night with gloves or socks and after 2-3 nights, healed! I don't know how it works and it doesn't particularly smell lovely, but I hope they never stop making it! Give it a try--I've tried so many other products, even prescription products, and this is the only product that had real results. It's great on my feet too!!
