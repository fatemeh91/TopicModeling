review/text: I purchased this walker after back surgery and used for every step for several weeks. It was lightweight and with tennis balls on the front feet slid nicely on different surfaces (rugs, hard floors, paved road).One major flaw the the walker had originall is that the foam hand grips were hard, and my hands became raw and red within 10 minutes.However, I came up with a cheap solution. I bought a small piece of black pipe insulation similar toM-D Building Product 50154 Indoor/Outdoor Pipe Insulation - Black (Pack of 40)at the home improvement store, and taped it to the top bars. Not only did it make the grip nice and soft it also increased the area I can use as the grip, and sometimes I held the walker close to me that the original grip position.With this slight improvement I really liked the walker. Although until I came up with this innovation I was very concerned that I would not be able to walk as much as I needed for my exercise after surgery, not because of my back but because my hands would become raw first.
