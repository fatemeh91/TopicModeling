review/text: This product did help to increase my appetite slightly and did give me slightly more energy. However, I wish that you carried it in chocolate. The only two flavors were Vanilla and Banana and I didn't think the Banana would be too tasty. I also feel that it is quite expensive for the size of the cans.
