review/text: I bought this watch for my blind mother 2 years ago. She is always pushing the wrong button and turning the alarm on by mistake. It crows like a rooster and goes off at the strangest times. I finally set the alarm to her dinner time, so it won't go off in church or the middle of the night. After 2 years the face of the watch stopped working - not a big deal since she can't see it anyway. The watch still talks and says the correct time. It has been an okay watch but it would be nice if there were some way to disable the alarm. Five buttons are too many for some seniors.
