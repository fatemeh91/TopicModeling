review/text: I don't like this oil at all. Not only is it greasy, but it smells mostly like sesame seed oil, which has me wondering if that's the main ingredient rather than the bhringaraj. I also don't notice any difference in my hair other than it smells like my hands after eating a greasy pizza.
