review/text: I just ordered my second Wahl 4000 shaver. I'm replacing a Wahl 4000 with a weak battery - it's been two years - it'll be a good spare once I get around to replacing the battery. Yes, the battery life could be longer, but overall it's a good shaver for the price. It shaves close, and I never get razor burn. I pulled out an old Remington I keep as a spare and I was surprised how much better the Wahl performs.
