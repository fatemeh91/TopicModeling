review/text: These are great brush heads. They last a lot more than 3 months - which is the standard time tooth brush companies tell you to change to a new brush. I brush at least twice a day with my Oral-B electric toothbrush and I get about 5 months per head (sometimes longer). They clean my teeth well and do a great job at stimulating my gums. These brush heads are hard to find in stores and when I do find them they are very expensive. Amazon's price is much cheaper so I always get it on Amazon.
