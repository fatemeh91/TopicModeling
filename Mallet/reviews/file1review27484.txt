review/text: I'm not usually a big fan of vanilla-flavored products, but I bought this in the vanilla flavor since I had several recipes on-hand that called for vanilla protein powder. I've bought ON's chocolate and strawberry protein powders in the past and they are among my favorite flavors, and this vanilla one is no exception. It's rich and creamy, and has a nice "ice cream" taste to it. It's also available here on Amazon in two smaller containers (instead of the large bin like this one), which are much easier to store if you don't have a lot of space.After doing a weight workout, try blending a scoop of this with some water or skim milk and some fruit (like a frozen banana and strawberries or blueberries), and you'll have a nice post-workout treat.I've also been using it to make French toast in the mornings: mix about two servings of egg whites with a dab of skim milk, add in 3/4 scoop of protein powder, keep mixing, and then dip a healthy bread like Ezekial bread into the mixture and cook it up.Another yummy ice-cream-like treat for clean eaters (in a recipe I found in _Oxygen_ magazine) is to blend one scoop of this vanilla protein powder with three dates, three or four large Brazil nuts, 1-2 tsp of vanilla, and 1/2 cup of water in the blender. After it's blended, add in about 8-10 ice cubes, and then freeze the mixture until it's hard again. This makes a tasty substitute for ice cream.Enjoy!
