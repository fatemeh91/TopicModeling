review/text: I have been diagnosed with probable Adenomyosis and was recommended a hysterectomy to alleviate my symptoms. I am all about natural healing and preserving my body parts so I did some research on how to deal with this. I've learned that I am estrogen dominant and have to balance out my hormones. I have been using DIM Plus for a few months now. My first noticeable change was that my adult acne cleared up! I have tried everything to get rid of it. I never thought it could be caused by excessive estrogen - now I know. Along with using natural progesterone cream, I have managed to rid my severe cramping and it has lightened up my menses. I will continue to use this wonderful product until I feel it's no longer needed.
