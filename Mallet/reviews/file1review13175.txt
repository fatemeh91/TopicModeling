review/text: My son stopped bedwetting. All thanks to the Chummie alarm CHUMMIE Premium Bedwetting Alarm with selectable tones, volume and vibration - Blue. This product works so well that it has stopped my son from wetting at night in just 5 weeks!Unfortunately they don't have the blue color available anymore, but the pink color is here for your daughters. CHUMMIE Premium Bedwetting Alarm (Pink) with selectable tones, volume and vibration - BIG RESULTS IN A SMALL BOXDon't get me wrong, these bedpads are great, but they DO NOT stop bedwetting. Chummie is the only product that worked for my son. I strongly suggest that you take a look at it.
