review/text: This lens cleaning cloth is great. It is the best I have ever tried. You still need to get the junk off the lens first, preferably with an alcohol wipe. Then you use this cloth by breathing on the lens and wiping off the little spots that are left. It works very well! Each one lasts me about 3 months, then it needs to be replaced because the smudge stuff will slowly build up on the cloth, but that happens with all clothes in my experience.
