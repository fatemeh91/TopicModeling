review/text: I'm sure it does the trick for helping re-colonize healthy digestive bacteria, but for me, it was a mistake because the FOS (fructo-oligo-saccharides) spiked my blood sugar and almost made my doctors think I was diabetic! Perhaps in an individual who isn't as sugar-sensitive, it wouldn't have been a problem. Usually, I buy the Ultimate Flora brand, but thought this did *not* have FOS, which I usually avoid. Perhaps the lettering on the front label (about the FOS) could have been a bit larger.
