review/text: It may be telling that I've never had old Gerber flats. Maybe if I had 20 or 30 year old diapers to compare these to, I'd give them a much lower rating. But I don't.These are absolutely the cheapest way to cloth diaper a baby if you want to buy new diapers. They're an ultra-basic birdseye cotton. MANY modern cotton flats are birdseye. They do indeed appear thin. BUT after a few washes, they are super-soft. I really cannot over-talk how wonderfully soft they are. They're a very close second to the flannel receiving blankets I also use as diapers.For comparison, I bought some OsoCozy flats, also sold here on Amazon, back in January. Those flats are visibly thicker. After I prepped the OsoCozy diapers, I did a head-to-head comparison. I put my daughter in an origami-folded Gerber flat, pinned, and kept her coverless until she peed. Then I did the same with the OsoCozy flats--same fold, same pinning, etc and kept her coverless until she peed. End result? These are JUST AS GOOD as the more expensive diapers.So, why am I not giving them five stars? One reason only: size. Flat diapers are supposed to last your baby from the newborn stage through toilet training. These really won't. For all that the product description says they're 27x27, they're not, at least not after being washed. They are very rectangular after prepping, and pretty small.Their small size makes them PERFECT newborn diapers, though. Even if most of your stash is all-in-one diapers, you would do well to buy a couple dozen of these for the first couple of months, especially if you tend to have smallish babies (one-size diapers don't usually fit below 8lbs). They work perfectly for small babies--yes, they even contain breastfed poop!--and once your babe has outgrown their intended use, they are FANTASTIC for stuffing pockets, lining gDiapers (this is my usual use for them these days), and using as doublers for fitted diapers or overnight diapers.
