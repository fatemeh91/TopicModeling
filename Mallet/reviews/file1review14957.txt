review/text: Our local health food store called the Spirulina 'brain food'. Shortly after taking the recommended amount, I can tell that I have an edge in alertness and concentration. All this without any side effects. I am happy with this supplement. Really good stuff!I checked all over the place on price, and Amazon has the best deal and the speediest service.
