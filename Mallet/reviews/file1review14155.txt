review/text: This is better for people with sensitive skin than the HQ171 extra fresh. It feels smoother and doesn't make my razor drag or my face burn like the evil extra fresh lotion does. The lotion packs last pretty long.For me it is cheaper to buy the lotion packs than buy new gillette mach 3 turbo blades. (this would depend on how much lotion you use) Although I don't get as close a shave I get way less irritation.
