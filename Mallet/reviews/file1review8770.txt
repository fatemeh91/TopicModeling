review/text: I don't consider myself a health nut, but I do like to take supplements that I know will increase my energy and well being. Like most smart shoppers, I was a bit skeptical because let's admit it, as a supplement this stuff is pretty pricey. It's almost a dollar a day. The big question is, is it worth it? You bet it is! I take one scoop every morning with 6 ounces of water and I definitely notice a difference in my energy levels, my hair, my skin and even a film on my lower teeth is now gone! I encourage everybody to take the supplement! It doesn't taste too bad either. I take it with water straight up, but I've heard of many people mixing it in orange juice and other beverages.I fully investigated the ingredients and nutritional profile before I purchased this product. It's a very high-quality product with only the best ingredients. It's a great way to get more nutrition and greens in your diet.
