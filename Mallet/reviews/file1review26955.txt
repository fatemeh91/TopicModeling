review/text: Did some research and Optimum Nutrition seems to have the best whey product out there. It has the least ammount of carbs and sugar, and the most protein. All the chocolate flavors taste awesome, and you definately see results. This is a lean protein, I am sure there are others out there meant for more serious gain, but this one hits the sweet spots for those who want to cut weight and build muscle. Never any complaints and have easily gone through 30+ lbs of the stuff
