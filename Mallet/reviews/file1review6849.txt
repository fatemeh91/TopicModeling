review/text: This loupe performs perfectly well, and for the money it's a great deal. You can use this on flat items by placing the canopy directly on the surface and looking through the eyepiece. You can also look at 3-D items by turning it around backward and putting the open end of the canopy up to your eye socket, you control focus by the distance from the item to the eyepiece, like a magnifying glass. Works great!I have these placed at various locations throughout our electrical engineering labs to aid in reading small part numbers on electronic parts, identifying color code stripes on resistors, and inspecting solder joints. It's a GREAT tool for the job!
