review/text: If you notice hairs sticking out of your ears or nose it is very frustrating to go after them with tweezers.No worries this is a wonderful appliance to trim those unsightly hairs away. A must for everyone who shares this problem.And don't worry it has a "protective safety cone" that protects the skin and keeps you from pinching the heck out of yourself. So you can feel free to go after those hairs with out worries. It uses one AA battery (not included).
