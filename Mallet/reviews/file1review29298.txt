review/text: Though the description says this is waterbase lube, it is in fact a silicon-base lube. With a similar consistency to baby oil, the lube is a bit runny and can get messy (I'm used to using gel lubes), but it gets the job done. Kind of a pain to clean up after, and definitely not worth what I spent, but I'm not so dissatisfied that I won't use it.Overall, I'd suggest buying a different lube of a similar price.
