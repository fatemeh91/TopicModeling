review/text: I bought myself 2 of these and attached one to my SLR and one to my point and shoot. I had so many people try to steal them that I started giving them as gifts!! These are an excellent alternative to your shirt tail and clipping them to your camera strap keeps them available at all times. If you love your camera and don't want to ruin your lens or filter, buy this cleaning cloth!! Actually - buy several. Someone you know is going to want one!
