review/text: For those who already using these blades, need I add more than the great value offered by Amazon!In terms of these blades, they offer the closest shave and minimum of re-application to the face, which can create the 'soreness'; very sharp and does not blunt down that quickly so there is great value per blade even though the intial cost seems a little high. Yep, bettter than an electric razor shave and saves that much more time and less dragging effect across the face, which I am sure helps to keep the skin in better shape!
