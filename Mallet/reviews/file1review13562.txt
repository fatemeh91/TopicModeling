review/text: I like these insoles, but the arch wasn't high enough for me. I have had plantar fasciitis for two years, and still have pain. The cushion filled cut out is wonderful. If the arch was higher I would have rated these insoles as a 5.I wear them on days I have moderate, to no pain so I don't know if they will get rid of cellulite. The feel is similar to my Earth shoes which make me stand strait and I do get a feel that I am getting some kind of workout while just walking.If you don't have high arches I think these will be great for you. They are well worth the money to try them.For those of you suffering from plantar fasciitis I recommend Brooks tennis shoes, originally made for runners. They hold your heal in place and have some arch support. I have tried so many other shoes, even with springs these work the best for me.
