review/text: This is a good tea to drink in the winter because it is quite warming. The ginger, licorice root, black pepper, are all very good at warming the body through. It took me a while to get used to having pepper in my tea, but now that I have I like the little kick of spice it adds. I don't even add honey anymore. Some might consider this to be a very "biting" tea. This is why I say it is good for winter. I've bought it during the summer and feel it would be more satisfying in cooler weather. I have to say that I won't buy again because of the pepper, but this reflects a personal preference, not impression of quality.Yogi Tea uses organic ingredients and 100% recycled cardboard for their attractive packaging. They are a company based out of Oregon.I couldn't say how well it helps with digestion, as I don't drink it on a regular basis. But we all know that ginger is very good for the body.
