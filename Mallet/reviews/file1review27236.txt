review/text: I have been working out pretty heavily for the past 3 months. I work out for 2 hours 4 days a week and 2 miles before that. I never thought in a million years that I would buy this stuff but after seeing the reviews, I had to give it a shot.Taste:Not too shabby, another review said the strawberry tastes "deity". It does have a slight hint of something other than sugar but all in all the stuff resembled a bland Strawberry Instant Quick. ...which is good, since quick was the sweetest thing I think I have ever drank. 1 out of 10 I give the flavor an 8. As in I could drink this stuff for a month with out any worries.Results:After using it for 2 weeks I did start to see more of a build after a work out. Before taking this supplement I noticed a plateau in my muscle growth. After 2 weeks my arms started gaining again. ...This stuff works.How to use it, for men anyways:Take your weight and then use that number to use the number of grams of protein per serving. Example: I am 200Lbs so I take 8 Scoops (8x24 grams of Protein) which puts me just under. With the nice rounded scoops I use, I can assume I am taking the proper amount. ...Honestly though I take about 100 grams a day, 1 scoop before and 1 scoop after a work out, and they through out the day I will take 2 more. From what I read your body can only absorb 24grams in protein in a 3 hour period. ...may want to look that up your self. Another review I read, a fellow used 2lbs container in 45 days and he saw results. ...no way he was doing 8 scoops a day.
