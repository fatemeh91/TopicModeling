review/text: I bought the product for a friend to use at the recommendation of a friend of his. They have been impressed with how good it was for keeping shaved heads smooth with little to no irritation. Be gentle with the pieces. One of the foils broke after a few uses. The replacement was easily purchased (at a low cost) from the Wahl product Web site. No problems reported since.
