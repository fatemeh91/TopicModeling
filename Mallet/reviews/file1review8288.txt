review/text: As noted in other reviews, this brush works great for wide mouth Nalgene bottles. But, approximately 7/8" in diameter with brushes compressed, it wont fit a bottle with a "Grolsch" type neck, which is less than 3/4" wide. (I got these from Ikea to store homemade syrups) I haven't tested the small neck Nalgene bottles. I just tried it on the GSI 10oz flask. It doesn't fit through the neck, however.
