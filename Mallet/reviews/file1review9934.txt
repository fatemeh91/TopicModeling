review/text: I really was hoping for something very precise. These have a nice point but they are not as small at the tip as I had hoped. The tip is certainly much larger than the Revlon Platinum Tweezer Slant Tip, which I have included in an image next to the Tweezerman - Ingrown Hair Splintertweeze.I am currently using these for crafting, which they are actually perfect for. Anytime I need to grab something fine like a bead or brad they really do the trick. They are also great for small stickers or stamped images or pretty much anything else. If they were advertised for this, I would give them 5 stars. As tweezers they fall a little short.I hope this helps!
