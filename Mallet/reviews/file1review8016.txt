review/text: The tips are very sharp and delicate, they are able to remove certain things (ahem)which are attempting to emerge in your facial area before other people even aware of those certain things. I use mine with a magnifiying mirror and sufficient light. DO NOT DROP THEM or you will ruin them, and much like buttered toast (though I know Mythbusters busted that), they will invariably land point down and then you must buy another pair. You may want to buy two pair just in case you are a klutz like me.These tweezers are a fine and delicate tool and must be treated as such.
