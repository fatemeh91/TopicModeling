review/text: This was my second edition of a Braun Silk Epil. My older one (several years old) finally just gave up and quit running. This one is even better (and I think it is cheaper too!). I haven't used the additional accessories now included, but I find the main product is even easier to handle and works better with less 'pain' than before (the 'staggered' tweezers help there).This is a great product for folks who really do have to shave daily and have dark, course leg hair. If you're looking for help, this is it. I wear capri slacks almost every day, and dresses on Sunday --no pantyhose in this heat! Having my Silk Epil again has released me from the burden of shaving every day.Yes, the first time is a bit more painful and time consuming, but it's worth it (and not unbearable). It took me about 30 minutes for both legs the first time. Once you get past the first time, the maintenance mode is a breeze (just don't get lazy over the winter months or you'll have to start all over!)I find I need to use mine about twice a week, but it's a quick process to catch those few hairs that have sprung up (I have to look for them, though; they're hard to 'feel' when they grow back so much softer!) I sometimes will shave afterwards just to get a really close, smoothe feel and catch the few stragglers I missed (and the 'fuzz' above my knee). But I don't even do this weekly, and that's a ton better than daily! I'd buy this product again--hey, I DID buy it again! And in a few years when this one poops out, I'll be searching on-line for a new one.
