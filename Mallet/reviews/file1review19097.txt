review/text: I used a bunch of these tests and was starting to think they were faulty. But this month I tested 15 dpo and got a positive result! The only problem with these strips is you have to collect your urine because it won't work with your urine stream like most store-bought tests. However, it's worth it when you normally pay anywhere from $5-$10 for just one test and these are way below that cost so you feel less guilty for testing too early.
