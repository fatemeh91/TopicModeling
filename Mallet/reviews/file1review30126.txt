review/text: I am not sure what the point in this item is. I bought in hopes of using it for cold sinus relief but it does no such thing. Maybe only works if you heat it up. It does not work cold at all. You can leave it in the refridgerator or freezer and it doesn't get cold. When you place it on your head it is room temperature and does nothing for sinus relief. HUGE waste of money.
