review/text: Head lice seem to be epidemic at my kids' school and I've had to use this product twice. The first time, all 3 of my kids had lice. 2 of them had MAJOR cases of it. I used Nix on them and then combed through with the plastic comb that came with the product. Basically, the plastic comb sucks. Throw it out and get a GOOD metal one. I used the Lice Meister, which Amazon doesn't sell. They do sell some other metal ones:Nit Free Terminator Lice Comb, Professional Stainless Steel Louse and Nit Comb for Head Lice Treatment, Removes NitsLiceGuard Professional Egg & Lice Comb - 1 Ea I've never used them though so don't know if they are good or not.I then nit picked every day with the Lice Meister and did find a few baby lice that lived through the treatment (Nix is supposed to kill all eggs but apparently it didn't). But I never saw any live lice after day 7 so I did not do a second treatment.The second time, just one of my kids had lice and a pretty mild case. I got more Nix and used it and then nit picked every day. I found one louse during the first comb through and never saw anymore after that, Nix must have killed all the eggs.The bottom line is this does work but don't expect that it will work on it's own. You still need to comb, comb, and comb some more! Comb every day for the first week. Don't use more Nix unless you see live lice after day 7. Then comb every other day for the second week and maybe twice a week the third week. Then be sure to keep checking your kids once a week or twice a month for lice. Take it from someone who has been through it, it is MUCH easier to deal with a case that has been caught early.
