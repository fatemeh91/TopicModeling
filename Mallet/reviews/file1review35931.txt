review/text: I absolutely love this toothbrush. Just a very gentle brushing at a 45 degree angle, making sure you get the gums as well, makes your mouth feel very clean and you do get all that sticky gunk off the teeth (which I didn't realize was there until it was gone). The bristles are varied lengths, so they get between the teeth nicely. I use with just water, a salt water solution, or sometimes a drop of hydrogen peroxide/baking soda. It works well with all. The handle is nice to hold, the overall design streamlined and attractive, and it's easy to keep clean. Sometimes I spend 5 minutes brushing my teeth and gums because it feels so good!
