review/text: I have had this product before from local well known orthopedic store but thought it was overpriced at $80, even in the $50's I paid I wonder if they are really worth it. They help but I don't know the cost to benefit ratio. Regardless they are in my dress shoes and make the feet somewhat more comfortable and provide better support than anything I've tried from the local Walmart/shoprite or pharmacy footcare sections. Vendor was very good and would look at other products they carry as well.
