review/text: 1. Taste.Other than some of the choc powder from Gaspari Nutrition, this is probably the tastiest brand of powder i have sampled.2. Digestibility .This particular brand i can consume ALOT of it (5lbs a week at least) and it gives me very little gastrointestinal problems or other wierd symptoms. Very 'clean' .3. Cost .$10 per pound or lower is 'benchmark' price.Winning combination.rocky road > extreme milk choc > double rich choc
