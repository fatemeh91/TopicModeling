review/text: I ordered the 12.5 grams size (10cc) for $10.93NOW Foods, LAVILIN UNDERARM DEODORANT CREAM - 12.5 gm (10cc)as a Prime Member. I had been debating whether to buy the size I did or the .44 oz size thinking it was more given it was in ounces and the higher price of $13.99. I found out that .44 oz is the same as 12.5 grams when I went to this site [...]. In fact .44 oz is actually 12.473790164 grams rounded up to 12.5. Please do go the the site to check it out. Same amount just charged more because it sounds like more product. I did hit the "Contact Us" button to speak with an Amazon Customer Service rep to report this. The woman I spoke with wrote up a report and told me she would forward it for investigation. As I just ordered Lavalin I cannot give an accurate review at this time but I will after I receive it and use it long enough to form enough of an opinion to leave feedback for it.
