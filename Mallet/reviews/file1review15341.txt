review/text: There still are smokers in the world, and a number of my clients are among them (as am I)! I have used a Zippo Pocket Ashtry for years and everyone who sees it thinks it's fantastic. You still have to hide around a corner somewhere when you smoke, but wherever you smoke, the Zippo makes sure you don't leave the evidence behind. That's why I ordered a lot of these little wonders to use as closing or listing gifts to clients. Ace Mart Stores was great - rapid shipping, items in brand-new, still-packaged condition - and I'm going to order more of these!
