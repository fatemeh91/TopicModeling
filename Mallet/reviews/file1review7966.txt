review/text: I bought this thinking I would love it as much as every other OXO product I own - boy was I wrong. The sponge constantly twisted off the handle during use, and after just two weeks, the tabs that connect the sponge to the handle broke off completely. This product does not live up to the OXO name. Go buy a cheap no-name brand; you'll be happier with it's performance.
