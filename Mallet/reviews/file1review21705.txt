review/text: I just transitioned my 22 pound 1 year old to this tub from one of those hard plastic things that kept him in one position. He loves this tub and so do I. He's got plenty of room to move around without getting into trouble, and has room for plenty of toys, too. I have to soak him once or twice a day for his eczema and this tubs accommodates that extremely well. I can completely cover him with water up to his midsection with no problems. It fits in my bathtub pretty well. I have to squish it just a little bit, but it's no big deal. He loved taking a bath before, but now he loves it even more. I also love that this deflates for travelling, which we'll be doing in the next few weeks. Not having to worry about how I'll bath him on vacation is a great thing. He'll feel right at home. And if this tub springs a leak anytime within the next few months, I will definitely replace it with the same tub. It's worth it to me.
