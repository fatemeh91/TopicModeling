review/text: As a fitness enthusiast for the last 15 or so years I have tried just about everything there is to try in the way of protein supplements and meal replacement drinks. Met-rx not only tastes good but it works. No digestibility problems like many other protein drinks and since its best mixed with water it travels well without spoiling. (if it thickens up on you, which it will do, just add a bit more water.)Now that I'm in my mid thirties I find it increasingly difficult to get the nutrition I need to recover from workouts without getting fat, but with Met-rx it's not a problem. Most days I drink 2-4 shakes plus a big green salad and eat fruits and whole grains and my body fat and recovery is as good as it was in my twenties. Great product!!
