review/text: I bought the the Wp-65 model , after 1 week the pump would not work. returned it to the store for a second one but it had no water pressure after 4 days. this marks a 100% failer rate. maybe the older waterpiks work but not the newer ones, Waterpik has really lowered its standards. If they keep going the way they are the company will probably fold in 9 months. the concept is good but they have to make a machine that actually works and without the jackhammer noise that shakes the whole house. I will be looking for a competers brand.
