review/text: I've had a series of different cushions of this kind, concentrating on the inflatable ones because I travel a good deal & have chronic lower back issues. This one is the best so far.I'm on a month-long African trip and inflated it 2-1/2 weeks ago when I left home. It is still inflated! The other ones, sooner or later, leaked, even when they weren't defective, but not the Back Booster! Before I left, the first one of these I had bought stopped holding air--I think the valve was defective. I wrote the email address on the box and got an immediate answer: give me an address and I'll send you a replacement. Three days later it was in my mailbox! No questions asked, no hassles, and a confirmation email to say when the Booster had been shipped!They have made me a loyal customer. I highly recommend trying this product!
