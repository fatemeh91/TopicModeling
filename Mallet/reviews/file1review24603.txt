review/text: After seeing my best friend rapidly lose 15 pounds in a week and a half, I asked her secret and she told me Zantrex. Mind you, I was already on Tight! Which is great, but I was being greedy and wanted to lose weight faster. I started taking the recommended dosage a day and my heart was palpitating like CRAZY; To the point that while I was CASUALLY walking, I had to stop and hold my chest.--a HUGE red flag. I suddenly knew why she lost weight--it was because of the nausea. I felt nauseous almost all the time on Zantrex. I could not look at food without feeling like crap and whenever I did indeed eat, I felt even worse. Did I lose weight? YES! I lost 17 pounds in two weeks, but, it's not worth feeling like your heart is about to explode.
