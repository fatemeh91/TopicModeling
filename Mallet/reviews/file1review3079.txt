review/text: My boyfriend loves these, and we haven't had problems with them. We have to use quite a bit of lube when we use them due to their dryness, but that may be why we haven't had any break on us. He likes the tightness and the feel of the condom, and they are the only condom we've tried that don't slip off. We love these and have had no issues with breakage so we plan to keep the bowl next to the bed full of these.Edit: After almost three years of only using this brand, we've had zero broken condoms and zero pregnancies. So I'm still really happy with these.
