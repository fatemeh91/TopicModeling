review/text: I can get motion sickness within 5 minutes of being a passenger in a car or bus and non-drowsy Dramamine is the only motion sickness medicine that allows me to feel completely symptom-free and manage to stay awake.Normal Dramamine works just as well for not getting sick while riding in the car, but I can't stay awake long enough to have a conversation, let alone share in the driving.I have tried many kinds of motion sickness remedies, including herbal (ginger capsules work fairly well, but not well enough to make me happy)and Non-drowsy Dramamine is, by far, my favorite. Finding it in a store seems to be impossible lately, so I've decided it's worth the extra cost for shipping to have get it from Amazon.
