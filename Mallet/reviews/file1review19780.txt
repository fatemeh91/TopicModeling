review/text: we have our eleven month old using the toilet with this adapter seat. it works pretty good, but i would think it works a little better for a baby girl. the guard in the front doesn't really come down enough and depending how how my son is sitting on it he can make a mess between the toilet seats. not sure if there's anything out there better, but i was a little disappointed in this design. still useable though, just requires a wipedown each time.
