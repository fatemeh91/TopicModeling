review/text: I've been using Lavilin, starting w/the black box and container, and it worked just as stated. It was manufactured by Ahava (sic) in Israel. It's been over 30 years, but within the last two/three years, after the change to the US, I've noticed that it isn't as effective anymore. I could go for a week or longer w/o using more, but it's not about a good product, it's about money. They've made this product less effective AND the price keeps creeping upwards. I'm very disappointed and will not use it anymore OR advise it's use to anyone else. Money over loyal customers--that's the business model.
