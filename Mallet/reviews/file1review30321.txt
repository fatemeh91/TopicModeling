review/text: i bought this "dustbuster" for my daughter who is the proud owner of 2 cats, all 3 of them residing in a small san francisco apartment. she needed something to keep up with the cat hairs and i sent her this product with it's special cat hair filter. SHE LOVES IT! now, she tells me, instead of running after her kitties (to hug them), she's cleaning up each and every hair the minute they shed one. when we talk on the phone, i have to tell her to turn it off so i can hear her. she's single and now i think she's in love...WITH HER NEW DUSTBUSTER!! ;-)P.S. she still hugs the cats!
