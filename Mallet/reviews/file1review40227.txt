review/text: I was excited to test drive the Rembrandt Dazzling White, Mint Flavor. And after using it for the past few days, I'm delighted to report that it's working wonderfully. I noticed a difference in the color of my teeth after the first couple of uses. I love very strong coffee and I also smoke, both of which are terrible on my teeth. Dazzling White is a product I would definitely recommend to anyone who wants a whiter smile.
