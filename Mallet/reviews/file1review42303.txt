review/text: I've been using Nature's Plus liquid vitamins for close to 2 years now. My fingernails and hair are growing strong. I rarely get sick. I think most of my illnesses were due to vitamin deficiencies. I even like the taste! It looks like thick green goo, but it tastes kind of like blueberries or something tropical. I have a hard time finding this item in town...it's always sold out and on back order. Everybody seems to like it!
