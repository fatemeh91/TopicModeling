review/text: I use this thing a lot and it's still kicking. The charging is a little annoying because you don't know when it's going to die until it does, and you can't use it again until it's charged up for a little bit. Just having the plug in won't run it off the outlet. Other than that it works phenomenal, I've dropped it a couple times and it's held up, and I shave my face and chest with it. Works really well, I liked it a lot.
