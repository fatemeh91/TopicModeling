review/text: This type of pen (Cross Selectip) was one of things our daughter had requested for Christmas. We ordered it and, at first sight, she loved it. The problem that has developed is its weight. She was exposed to Lyme a number of years ago and the pen is too heavy for her to easily use. Not the pen's fault, mine for not noting the description included the term heavy.
