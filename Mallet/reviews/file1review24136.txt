review/text: I received the product with an expiration good for another two full years. Upon opening, everything seemed fine and the product works to provide slight benefits to concentration, memory, and recall.However, a few days after opening, the capsules began to crack and become soft, and elicited a terrible odor. It is my understanding that these capsules are intended to break down in the presence of moisture; but I heeded the recommendations and store the container in a cool and dry place. I cannot explain the spontaneous wearing out other than by the lack of quality in the consideration of the capsule's integrity. It is almost humorous to believe that exposure to the air initiated this breakdown. The pitfall of this design? The pill loses its "two-staged" claim, works quickly, and wears out in a few short hours.Be aware that as this is a consumable dietary supplement classified as a grocery product, you cannot return it.
