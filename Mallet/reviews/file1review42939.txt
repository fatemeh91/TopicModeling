review/text: I love the way this scrub cleans... and I use all 'green' products in my home..... but I don't like this scent. The geranium scent is 'rose' geranium (which is really a pelargonium)- it is cloying and too flowery it gives me a headache. I like the lavender... I haven't tried the lemon yet. Next time I will get a different variety.... but I will always use this brand!!!!
