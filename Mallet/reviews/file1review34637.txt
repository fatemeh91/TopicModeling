review/text: This product is great, if you want to take small doses of coconut oil. If you are planning on taking doses based on weight and need more than a teaspoonful per dose, you might just want to go for regular oil, as these capsules only hold about 1/8 tsp of oil. Otherwise, they are fine :)
