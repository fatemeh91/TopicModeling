review/text: This is a great product, its long history says far more than I ever could. This item will sit in my pocket for a long time. I do not smoke but I do like playing with lighters and find it useful to have one around similar to my Swiss Army knife. It does run out of fluid weekly, but that takes about 2 minutes or less to remedy. Love it!**DOES NOT COME WITH FLUID**Don't rate poorly because it doesn't. If they had fluid in them while shipping they would become small bombs. It is easy to find fluid local drug stores have it.**DOES NOT COME WITH FLUID**
