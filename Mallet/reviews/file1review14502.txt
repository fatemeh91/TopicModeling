review/text: I hate to feel nauseous. Hate it. So during my first pregnancy I was anxious to find anything that might work to help me lose the morning sickness. I tried Sea Bands (no effect, returned them), saltines (ok), ginger ale (also ok), prescription meds (wonderful) and preggie pops. I thought they would be convenient as I could carry them around with me in a pocket or purse and not have cracker crumbs all over my growing tummy. Although the preggie pops are indeed portable, that's about all they are. They did NOTHING for my morning sickness - they're just a more expensive lollipop. Apparently they're supposed to help with dry mouth, but ANY candy sucker or mint will perform the same function for a much lower price. Although some people have said these pops have been helpful for them, I can say without a doubt that I would not buy them again.
