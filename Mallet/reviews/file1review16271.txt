review/text: These little tablets work very well in my dishwasher. They are individually wrapped and free in the box. To use, you tear open the packet and drop it in the soap dispenser- one tablet per load. So , this box will do twenty loads of dishes.They work about as well as any detergent- better with hotter water and a rising agent. All together I am pleased with this product.
