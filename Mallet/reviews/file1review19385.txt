review/text: I tried these because I liked the prenatal vitamin. I wanted calcium, which these have, and I didn't mind taking 6 a day. My periods were already regular and I usually have one day of tiredness before my period. When I started taking these it really screwed up my hormones. I suddenly had 2 weeks of pms and it made my period 6 days late(it's never that late). I stopped taking the vitamin so my period would start. I thought I might be pregnant - I wasn't. I tried taking it again when my period was over. It made me start spotting and feel really bloated again. I went back to my prenatal. I don't doubt this vitamin has helped a lot of women with pms, but if you don't have pms I suggest taking a vitamin without "hormone balancing" herbs.
