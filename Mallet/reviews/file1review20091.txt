review/text: A quick history. I am 35 years old and had my thyroid removed 20 years ago. I have never had normal hormonal function, with a very whacky, irregular cycle. I have been told by doctors that my lack of a thyroid has crippled my hormone production.I started taking DIM after coming across an article that mentioned it was helpful in promoting hormone health... The sales rep at Nutrition Smart told me that I should try Estrosense DIM over Nature's Way because it was a better overall supplement.. I did use use the Estrosense for one month and finished the 60 ct. bottle, but didn't feel any difference in my PMS symptoms or period (or anything else). I then read many positive reviews of Nature's Way and ordered a 120 ct. bottle..Within a week I noticed a major improvement in 2 things. Most noticable was my skin. I have always had extremely oily skin and scalp, but esepecially in the last few years and it would worsen after day 14 of my cycle. On NW DIM my acne was clearing up, my skin wasn't shiny and my hair less greasy. Also my skin wasn't extremely ruddy or splotchy anymore and was evening out in tone. Now 2 mos later I feel like my skin is the way it should look, healthy and normal. I am not horrified by photos of my face anymore and actually like how my skin looks.As far as my cycle, it has also improved. For the last two cycles I didn't have bad cramps and my period was shorter by 2 days. I didn't get as bloated as usual, but still did have some water retension. In the past, however, I would gain 5 lbs in water weight and be extremely uncomfortable for a week. This time it was more tolerable.So I highly recommend Nature's Way for anyone who feels they have problems with hormones, whether it is lack of production like me, or too much as in estrogen dominance. At the very least buy the 120 ct bottle and give it two months to see for yourself..
