review/text: I bought this as a second stethoscope to keep in my "rescue bag" in my car. I'm a vet tech and sometimes I see a stray and it may be hurt. I didn't want to use my nice Littmann - I leave that one at work.With that said, I am impressed with the sound quality of this stethoscope! I would have given it four stars, but the heart shaped bell is quite a bit larger than it looked in the photo. I would have preferred a much smaller bell.Shipping was super fast and the packaging was perfectly wrapped to ensure that the scope was safe during shipping.
