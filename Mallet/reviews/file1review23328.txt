review/text: My grandmother had one of these. I used to sweep her carpets for her when I was little. This carpet sweeper is great. It works fine and is handy to have around for quick clean ups. The only thing is that if you don't take a mallot and hammer in the handle pieces, they won't be tight and they will keep falling apart. Banging it on the floor as suggested does not give you a very permanent hold. I love it.
