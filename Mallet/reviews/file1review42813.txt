review/text: We have used this product for years and are very happy with it. Unfortunately, in this order the wrong version of this was shipped (there is another, I think newer, formulation called Primal Defense Ultra). The Ultra formulation doesn't *seem* to work as well for us. As I was not home when this arrived and hubby didn't realize there is a difference, he opened and began using the product. When I returned home a couple weeks later it was obviously too late to return the product.I am placing an order for this product again. Hopefully, the correct one will ship, as I really do like this, the original, formulation.
