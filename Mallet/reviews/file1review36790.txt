review/text: My sock aid I used daily for five years cracked just before I was leaving for vacation. I ordered this one because of the ability to get it fast. The type I use is a similar one but is solid (not the three finger design). Unfortunately it was not available for Amazon Prime shipping. It was free shipping but would take 5 days to get to me. Expedited shipping cost way more than the unit cost.This unit is poorly constructed. After 2 weeks of use, the blue material is separating from the white. When you put the sock on the unit, the thing collapses at the bottom where only a child could get it on easily. I have a size 7 woman's foot and had trouble getting it into the sock. The pull straps are also fraying and coming apart from the main unit.Save your money and order Mecanaids found at this Amazon URL: http://www.amazon.com/Sock-Aid-with-Foam-Grip/dp/B000SOJM84/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid;=1341762328&sr;=8-4&keywords;=sock+aid.This is the type I have used for 5 years daily, which speaks highly of the construction I plan to order this for myself now that I am back home.
