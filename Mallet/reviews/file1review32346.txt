review/text: My mouth got so dry at night it actually woke me up. My dentist told me it was important to have moisture in my mouth to reduce decay and recommended Biotene toothpaste, but neither that nor the mouthwash helped night dryness caused by the HCTZ I take. While I like several things about the toothpaste and mouthwash, I needed something extra and found this product does the trick. This is a small tube and with the recommended dose would be gone pretty fast making it an expensive solution, but I use only a fraction of what they suggest and find it works just fine. As a result, the tube lasts and I am not bothered at night by a super dry mouth.After brushing before bed, while my mouth is still moist from that, I use less than 1/4" of gel and smooth it around with my tongue. It's great to get that needed relief. I've also found that brushing my teeth after dinner, thus allowing longer before bedtime for natural saliva recovery, helps with the nighttime dryness (also keeps me from snacking at night :). Then I just use this product before retiring. Highly recommended.
