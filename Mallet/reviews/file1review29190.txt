review/text: My wife and I have been using the Oral-B CrossAction Battery-Powered Toothbrush, powered by one Alkaline AA battery, for a few years. We both prefer it over the manual toothbrush because we feel that the final results are cleaner teeth in less time, and at a price considerably lower than that of several of the other name brand powered toothbrushes. The original design of the brush was changed in order to prevent the brush from accidently coming loose while in use, but the new brush design has definitely corrected that problem.
