review/text: I was concerned about my blood pressure as I went in for a physical and I did not pass the first time as bp was 158/80. I had less than 3 weeks time till my next one as this was for a job and knew I had to change things. I immediately tried to lose a goal weight of 7-10 pounds by eating better (oatmeal 2x a day and increased fruits and veggies), exercised every day when I could and as the blood pressure supplements I had been taking before the physical were not helping I searched for something else that would work fast. I have used Vaxa before and they do not have testimonials on their site, but when I came here to Amazon and saw the first review I was very hopeful. By the time I ordered and received Circulin i only had about a week till my next physical but I was already losing weight and cutting down on my snacking and sugars for the day. When I went back for the 2nd physical my bp was 134/86 which made me happy as I passed physical and am hopeful by the end of the month it will be even lower, Together with diet and exercise changes this product really does work and I am getting ready to order my second bottle before my first one runs out. Like the first reviewer I did not want to start on prescription drugs. When I told the Dr. I was going to get it down naturally I received a dirty look, but I was able to do it within 2 weeks! Not at my goal yet but will be obtaining it soon.
