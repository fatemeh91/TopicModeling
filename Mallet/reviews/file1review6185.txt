review/text: I purchased this product because I was having a total knee replacement and needed a higher toilet seat temporarily. This toilet seat was very sturdy and I felt secure using it. One complaint was that it is not really "elongated." Yes, it fit on my elongated toilet bowl, but the opening itself is not elongated, which was a disappointment. Overall, though, a good value for the short time I needed it.
