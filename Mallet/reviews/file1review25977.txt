review/text: I bought this mask because sunlight streaming across my eyelids tells my brain it is time to GET UP!! In summer that can be 5:30 or 6:00 on a Saturday morning. Something clearly had to be done about that- and I thought this mask might be the answer.The way that this mask fits on my face results in a light leak around my nose. When I tighten the band that goes around my head the light leak disappears but the mask smashes my nose a bit and compresses my nostrils- making it hard to breathe. It is too much to ask that a mask like this fit every face- and it clearly wasn't designed for mine.I have come to the conclusion that room darkening window shades will work for me better than this mask. It also is a bit awkward when you attempt to sleep on your side with the mask on.It's a good thing the ear plugs are a free gift because they proved ineffective and useless.Maybe there might be a way to design this mask with no light leaks- and also in a way that did not press against your nose, effectively half closing your nostrils?
