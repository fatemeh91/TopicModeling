review/text: I got these pill containers as a present. I need them to take with me while on vacations Now I use the pill containers for my regular weekly pill intake. They save time espically when taking 6 + pills twice a day. I like them so much I will recommend as a gift to others who need a good quality pill box. Easy to open and easy to read the days of the week.
