review/text: Originally, I ordered a medicine chest that was too small for my needs. When I let them know, they found the perfect one for me. It is exactly like the one that I purchased many years ago and I have been looking for additional ones for years. I like to fill a month's supply of medicine and vitamin supplements at a time, since filling the containers is one of my least favorite jobs. Thanks again for working with me.
