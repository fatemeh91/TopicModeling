review/text: I got the acai for health reasons and I'm sure it's doing what it's supposed to do. It disolves much harder than I thought it would, if it disolves at all. Like others, putting it in a smoothie distributes it through the drink better. It's good in the Kefir products. Had no taste that I could discern.
