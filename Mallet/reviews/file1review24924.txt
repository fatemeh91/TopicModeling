review/text: We have been trying to conceive for one year now. Over the summer I bought FertilAid after reading all of the positive reviews. I have always had an irregular cycle. I started taking FertilAid in hopes that I would have a more regular cycle and I had just the opposite happen. After taking the FertilAid for 3 months I still had no signs of AF. After one more month I went to the OB/GYN who recommended I go to a RE and then prescribed me Provera to induce my AF. FertilAid did nothing for my cycle and actually made it worse (which I didn't think was possible). Don't waste your money or time on this product.
