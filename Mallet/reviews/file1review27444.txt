review/text: I have used Whey Optimum nitirition 100% whey gold for over a year and a half now. It is packed with protein and does help with muscle building and shorten your recovery time after you work out. I have tried the vanilla creme flavor and would say it's a 4/5, but stay away from the cookies and cream. The cookies and cream taste more like a coffee flavor and it's not that great; more like a 2/5. I would recommend this to anyone who is starting to build muscle because it does help out. The shipping was fast in that it came in a week and cheaper to buy on amazon than in-store.
