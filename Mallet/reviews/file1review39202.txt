review/text: I bought a norelco basic sideburn trimmingk it but after realizing it couldn't cut close at all for sideburns I started using it as my main trimmer. My hair is really thin and easy to cut so it was okay but it got dull/weak really quickly. Then I stumbled onto this wahl pro on amazon and it got good reviews so I bought it. It is extremely powerful and cuts through my hair very quickly, the norelco started hurting and took a long time. This also can not completely cut sideburns but this one does exactly what it was made to do trims quickly and thoroughly. If you need a good bang for the buck trimmer look no further.
