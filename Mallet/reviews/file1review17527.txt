review/text: I've only used this trimmer five times, but I would give it six stars if I could. It didn't look like it would work, but I took a chance and bought it after reading the good reviews on Amazon. It does a better job and gets the job done much faster than the previous two trimmers I've owned with the various "combs." I could not be happier with it, except I was hoping to find a corded version to help save the environment. I have not had to recharge it yet.
