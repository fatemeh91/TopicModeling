review/text: I have chronically dry eyes and after having to put in eyedrops multiple times a day with only temporary relief, my eye doc suggested I try some omega 3 supplements. To my surprise they have actually helped with the dryness throughout the day especially when I have to have my contacts for days when I'm moving around a lot.I haven't had problems with the fishy smell, but I did note that it didn't work too well initially when I failed to read the directions and wasn't taking the recommended number of pills. After consistently taking the recommended 3 in morning I got more relief throughout the day. Overall a good supplement to try if your eyes are constantly dry and you're tired of having to use eyedrops constantly.
