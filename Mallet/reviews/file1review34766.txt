review/text: This worked for me but not my daughter. She has her father's genes I suppose and needs something stronger. She has my desire to go as natural as possible though but this didn't work for her. It smells nice and I liked it, thus the 3 stars, but because it wasn't strong enough for the teenager I havent bought any more. We've moved on to a national brand that's been going natural with a lot of their products and are sticking with that for now.
