review/text: This thing is better than the fluid wart removers because:1.The wax base makes it easier to place EXACTLY.2.The acid is 45% rather than the usual 15%.I rub some wax on a band aid, then put the band aid just where I want it. I seal the band aid with waterproof adhesive tape and wear it for a few days.Maybe the stronger acid will act in an evil way, so PAY ATTENTION.
