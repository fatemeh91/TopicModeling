review/text: We bought this tub 3 months ago for our 6 month old daughter. It was great until it developed a slow leak on a seam. We would just have to re-inflate it a bit before each use, but now it won't even make it through one bath. Since it had only been 3 months, I called Amazon to see if they would replace it. Amazon told me I needed to contact the manufacturer, Kelgard. When I contacted them I was told to contact Amazon. So bottom line is no one seems to want to send us a replacement. It is great until it leaks. Is sure seems like we should have gotten more than 3 months use from it!
