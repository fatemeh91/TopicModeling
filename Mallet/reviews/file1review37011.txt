review/text: A little bit bigger than your average condom (especially anything made by Trojan or Lifestyles) but smaller than Magnums, these condoms are the perfect size. I love Durex anyway, but these seem to be even better. They feel similar to the Ecstacy brand made by Trojan, but have way less of a rubbery smell to them. Keep in mind that when you order from this seller you'll probably be receiving a lot of condoms in a plastic ziplock or something similar, but I used the entire batch and didn't have any problems with a single one. No babies here!
