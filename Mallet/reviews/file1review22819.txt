review/text: I wanted to try this product due to the great reviews from Amazon and [...]. I wasn't prepared for all the pills (like 18/day). But not a problem. I rec'd the product quickly and it was in good shape.It's been about 5 days now and I can no longer take it. The directions say to take one packet upon waking and another one later in the day. If I take the pills on an empty stomach, my stomach feels as if its on FIRE. My usual routine is to wake up, take my supplements, work out, then grab a bite to eat. So unfortunately, this product is not for me.
