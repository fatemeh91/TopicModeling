review/text: So I'm pretty new to going "green" ;) and have been trying a couple different green drink products. I consider this the professional grade compared to the others because others worked ok, but nothing like this brand. It took me a while to get used to the taste, but honestly it magically became more of just a neutral taste and I now I actually crave it. I keep a nalgene bottle full of it everywhere I go and I feel more engeritic throughout the day drinking it. I will warn you, you will get a lot of attention from people at work asking why you're drinking what they call "pond water" which leads to a great conversation on the healthy benefits of greens. I am in no way a vegetarian or vegan, not saying that's bad, just normal guy trying to live a longer more enjoyable life with the people I love. A+ product, I definitely recommend it.
