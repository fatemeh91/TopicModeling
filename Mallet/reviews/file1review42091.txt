review/text: I was suffering with severe groin pain during my pregnancy, so I purchased this belt hoping to find relief. I found this belt to be very uncomfortable. The elastic is so rough,it irritated me all day. Also the straps that go over your shoulders come up so high you are very limited on shirt options without the bands showing. Also, I had seen that it runs small and to order asize up, so I did. The band still cut into my lower ribs around my waist. By the end of the day I couldn't wait to take it off! I wore it once, then found a different support band and am much more comfortable now.
