review/text: I wish I could give this product no stars.I bought this stuff from a local health store and used it as directed. The product boasts a higher content of salicylic acid than other products. When I applied the product I was expecting it to burn. However, I never felt a thing. It's doesn't go on very smooth either (it's not like lip balm) and seems to cake up. I used it for 2 months and the wart actually got a little bigger. I saw no noticeable change other than that. It was a waste of money for me. When I went back to the health store to tell the guy about the product, they had already stopped selling it because of complaints of it not working. Oh well.
