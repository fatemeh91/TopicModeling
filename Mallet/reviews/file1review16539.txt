review/text: love focus factor, i used it for school and i can remember every thing i planed the day before. i had a bit more energy than i usually had, i remembered every thing i had to do threw out the day. my mind was very focused. i seen the reviews below and focus factor is not for all but is for people who have a really hard time paying attention. like your mind is a tv and it is constantly changing the channels when trying to pay attention. i am a intern for my teacher and i need to get things done in order to get my credit and certs. it works like their is no tomorrow. i bought a 2 pack and still using them.
