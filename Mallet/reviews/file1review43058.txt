review/text: My daughter was having extreme back pain in 8th month of pregnancy and was taking tylenol round the clock without much relief. She did not want me to buy this for her because she thought it was silly since she only had one more month to go. I bought it anyway and within 2 days of wearing this brace, she was totally off the Tylenol and painfree! She LOVED it and wished she had gotten it sooner. She plans to wear it starting in the 6th month the next time she gets pregnant to prevent back pain. The only negative, and it is a small negative, is that you have to wear crew or turtleneck tops to cover the criss-cross straps in the front. Well worth the money. Would have paid alot more for the relief it brought my daughter!
