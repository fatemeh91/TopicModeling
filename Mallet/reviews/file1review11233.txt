review/text: I was shocked to see that other people have had such bad experiences with this thermometer. My husband went out and bought 4 different thermometers including this one because we have four kids and our thermometers seem to always be missing when we need them. This thermometer reads the fastest and it's got a color coding system so if the temperature is normal it shows green, if it's a low fever it's yellow and if it's a high fever it shows red. I love this! Plus the numbers are big and easy to read. This is the thermometer I always look for now when my kids are sick.
