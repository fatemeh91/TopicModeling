review/text: After reading "The Trigger Point Therapy Book," I purchased the Body Back Buddy to work on my trigger points. I unfortunately got a little to harsh with the use of the Back Buddy...my nerves became inflamed. But I know now what pressure it takes to loosen the trigger points, especially in my back. Now I don't have to spend so much money going to massage or chiropractic.
