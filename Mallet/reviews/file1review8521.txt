review/text: Of course I didn't see all the reviews about the bristles being too soft to do a good job of cleaning the bottles until AFTER I ordered it, but I am so glad I ordered it before I saw that. The brush came today and I used it in one of the 40 ounce kleen kanteen bottles that had mold? something black inside the bottle and it worked great! Clean as a whistle! Love this brush!
