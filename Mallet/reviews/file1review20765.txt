review/text: I'll try not to be redundant, as most of all the glowing feedback on display I agree with 100%. I'll add that I have the enviable honor of having sensitive skin, along with bullet proof stubble. It's always been difficult to shave every day because of my beard being pretty thick. Since a close shave irritated my skin with most razers, I would have to wait 2 - 3 days for a close and comfortable shave. More than likely it's the newfangled foil, but I can shave every day now if I choose and not have irritated skin, and/or a 12 o'clock shadow. The cleaning system is also handy for those of you lazy like me
