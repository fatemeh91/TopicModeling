review/text: I tried this as a supplement for our high-shed dogs, who also tend to have dry skin, the on the recommendation of our vet. The salmon oil itself worked great and I noticed a change in their skin and fur in less than a week of use on triple dosage (1000 mg/30 lb. is normal dog dosage). I liked that the softgels were pre-measured, making it easy to assess how much to give, that they were a human grade product and that they didn't need to be stored in the refrigerator, like many high quality oils. And the dogs really liked the taste, even going to the point of boycotting their kibble if I forgot to add these. The major downside was that they had trouble puncturing the capsules, so I had to cut them open and mix them into their food, which got quite messy. (It's basically impossible to cut them in half without the oil squirting everywhere.)So, I'm totally sold on salmon oil, but am looking into less messy options right now. But, if I don't find anything as effective, I'd happily return to these as I felt they did work well and, as I said, the dogs actually enjoyed them, too.PS: Though I didn't take these myself, I'd note that, for human use, these are HUGE pills to try and swallow. I don't usually have a problem with pill size, but these are about twice the size as my giant prenatal vitamins were and I can't imagine how you'd get them down in one gulp.
