review/text: Well, I can't really remember how many of these I have purchased during thelast 10 years. They always died the same death, the hose between the reservoirand the tip began leaking and that was the end of it. Unfortunately there arenot many alternatives, so I keep spending money on this brand. Let's hope thisunit will last.
