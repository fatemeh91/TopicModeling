review/text: I get a good reaction from melatonin, and usually take 1.5 mg at night trader joes brand but wanted to try a time release version. This did not work well for me, I only tried two nights but I think the b-6 had me restless or something I am not really certain what the issue was but this did not work for me at all and I am going to throw it out and try something else
