review/text: How do I even tell you how much I love this little bag?!I love it.I've seen other reviews that said it only fits regular tampons...define regular? I can fit three super plus Tampax Pearl in it. 6 if I lay them head to toe.I can also fit my Iphone, a credit/debit card, and some cash and flat keys in it if I want to be silly and use it as a clutch for a night out (and yes, I would do that).It's super cute, super fun, and functional. Get It!
