review/text: My boyfriend had this razor and occasionally I would use it when I'd stay at his place. I absolutely fell in love with it. I know it's a guys razor, but given that I'm a woman and as a woman, you basically shave everything, I was getting tired of razors that didn't shave as smooth as they should....oh plus the fact I'd have to replace the razors that are made for women, whether it's paying $30 for a new razor head, or just buying a new razor all together. Anyway, I decided to buy one for myself and I will never go back to cheap, disposable, plastic razors ever again. The benefit with this is that it's heavy and you can change out the blade, which means it cuts close (which could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on how steady your hand is)and it shaves as smooth as fresh as the first time, every time (because you can change out the razor blades which come in huge packs at once for a reasonable price). This razor was worth every penny and I use it to shave everything- just be careful because it is so sharp and heavy, if you aren't paying attention it is easier to nick yourself than with plastic razors. Either way, I would gladly recommend this razor to any friend, guy or girl. It's so worth it- the feel, the positive results, the endless supplies of razor blades you can purchase aside from this, and the fact that it is just cool looking. Nice product indeed.
