review/text: Peaceful Mountain Shinglederm Rescue, 1.4-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2)I contracted shingles early in July of 2011. When i saw this product, I felt very hopeful that it would help my PHN. I waited almost two weeks to receive it and was very disappointed with the results. It didn't help at all. Also it's a very small amount and didn't last very long. Save your money! Get a prescription from your doctor for a med that will really help.
