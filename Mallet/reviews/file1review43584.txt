review/text: We purchased the Omron HEM-711AC based upon recommendation from a leading consumer magazine. The price from Amazon was very attractive. The items itself was very easy to use. However, my wife felt the cuff was uncomfortable at full inflation. Worse, we could not believe the numbers. After several tries over about 5 days, it always measured high for her; higher than any number she ever got at a doctor's office or drug store BP monitor. And I got numbers lower for my BP than I am used to seeing. So we had not faith in the accuracy of the numbers, and upon her Dr's guidance, returned the unit. Not sure what we will do as my Dr. recommended the Omron brand as well.
