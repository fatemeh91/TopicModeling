review/text: unlike other balms which promoted acne near my lips and caused a vicious cycle of application and drying, karite lips actually enabled my lips to heal. after years of dependency on inferior drugstore balms, i was able to ween myself off of lip balm in all but the coldest winter months. i bought the first stick over 3 years ago and it has lasted until now. this is one of the best products i have ever used.
