review/text: I give this to my son every time he starts coming down with something and his sickness just seems to go away. I use a medicine syringe to extract it and just give it straight into my son's mouth because the bottle (like most other Child Life bottles) leaks when you pour it onto a spoon, and given the price, I'm saving all I can!
