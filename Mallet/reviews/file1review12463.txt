review/text: I've been struggling with heel pain from plantar fasciitis. I had high hopes for this product, having previously used the more cast-like products which are too immobilizing. This is far less constricting and even lets you get up to walk to the bathroom in the middle of the night. Unfortunately there is a BUT coming. If I adjust the velcro on my foot with even a little bit of pressure (which is needed) I wake up with tingling in my toes. No matter how much I try adjusting the pressure it doesn't seem to help. I'd love to give this product 5 stars, because it does help, but I can't.
