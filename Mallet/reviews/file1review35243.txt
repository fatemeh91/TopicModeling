review/text: This Pedialyte is the same product as in the groceries and this is a similar price, the convenience of delivery really makes it easier on those that cannot leave the house easily.I use this for my elderly mother as she doesn't like to drink enough water, so she does very well on this product, always enjoys it and will always drink it.I add a little well water to it not only to stretch it, but to add the plain water she won't drink otherwise. I don't know if that would work for everyone, but I've found it most helpful.They also sell it in the individual 8 oz containers that are easily carried and consumed and well received.
