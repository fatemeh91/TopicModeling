review/text: This is a nice pen, and I think that when people see me writing with it they know I am super serious about ink pens. However, this pen is not without flaws. To start it wrote in all caps for the first two weeks I used it. It was very embarrasing because everyone thought I was being a jerk. When I got that mess sorted out the pen would write a letter "B" anytime I needed to write a "P", and I could never figure out how to get the letter "S" to appear. It also claims to be a multi-function pen, but it was completely useless when I tried to check the tire pressure on my car. I would recommend this pen, but only to people who are interested in writing, and only words that do not need an "S", "B", or "P".Thank You.
