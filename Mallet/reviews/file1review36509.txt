review/text: I have used various deodorants with levels of aluminum and other ingredients that have been connected with breast cancer and Alzheimers. It was time for a change. Weleda Wildrose Deodorant spray is made with great odor neutralizers, like citronella. The wild rose scent isn't so strong that it is obtrusive, yet, isn't so subtle that you don't feel fresh and clean. The scent lasts and doesn't merely cover body odor. The package does recommend that you spray it, as you need to, since it isn't made with chemicals that normally "kill" scent, as well as serve as strong anti-persiparant components. Pretty pleased so far!
