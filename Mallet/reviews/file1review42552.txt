review/text: I've been using this stuff for years, and I am one of the most selective people when it comes to food and nutritional products. I am lactose intollerant, and tend to feel sick from most foods. I've tried a few flavors from Elite protein and they've all been phenomenal. (chocolate mint, butter-cream toffee are excellent!) It is low calorie, low carb, low sugar, and the perfect protein for me. Most times I only use 1/2 a scoop. I recommend using it in a blender, if you use a shaker-cup instead make sure it is high quality. The blender always works best for me.
