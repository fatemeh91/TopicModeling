review/text: I purchased a Wahl razor in June 2004.I have owned Wahl products in the past.My razor stopped running on Jan 10th 2005.I took it to a certified Wahl repair store and found out that Amazon had sold me a razor that was out of WARRANTY before I received it.Up to today I have no razor and cannot get repairs because of problems between the two companies,as to whom is responsible.I would suggest that buyers investigate warranty dates on mdse before purchacing from Amazon
