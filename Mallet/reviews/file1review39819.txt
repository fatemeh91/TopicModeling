review/text: When I first started buying gophers 10 years ago they were a precision instrument. I could pick up toothpicks, grains of rice and even needles from a carpet or any other surface. The last few I bought had the cups misaligned. The current and last one I will ever buy is assembled with the jaws at a 90 degree angle. From now on I will pay a little more and get something of better quality.As the song goes : "since there ain't no zeroes I'll give it a one."
