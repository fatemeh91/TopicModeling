review/text: I have seen this in stores before for 50.00 I am pretty sure I got for someone about a year ago. I have been searching for it for a while, a friend got me one of those clocks that makes rain sounds but its not the same as real water.other reviewers have said its to loud I don't think so just make sure you place the pump all the way on the bottom and put the right amount of water to cover the pump. you can play the sounds at the same time as the rain if you wanted to.and yes its plastic as i read in another review, what did you expect it holds water.I personally love it and would buy it again and again.
