review/text: My neurologist recommended this supplement starting with 2 a day and going to 3, along with phosphatidylserine 3 a day, to counteract the short term memory loss associated with taking topomax (prevents migraines.) I've taken these now for 4 months. They helped quite a bit until the dosage of topomax got too high. I stopped the topomax but have kept up the two supplements. I notice these supplements have cleared up some of my 63 year old foggy thinking and I am finding I am able to think more clearly on my feet which as a high school teacher is critical. My regular bridge partners commented on how much sharper my playing is! So that's outside confirmation. Its not a miracle drug, but I've definitely noticed the difference. I've recommended it to several friends who are complaining of memory loss.
