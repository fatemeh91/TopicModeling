review/text: This seat has worked great for us. I was looking for a really secure seat for my timid daughter that would also be easy for her to put on the toilet herself. This seat has lived up to my expectations. The only issue I've had with it is that it didn't fit on my parents toilet, which has a smaller plastic seat.
