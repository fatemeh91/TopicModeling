review/text: I wouldn't recommend these (or any other 9V rechargeable) for smoke detector applications. They drain down after 120 to 180 days and need a charge...which is ok, if you are disciplined enough to make this necessary recharge. They will save you money over time compared to the alky bats, so you make the call. Chargers for these bats are also pricy and you need to make sure you have a charger that will handle your battery. An 9.5 charger will fry an 8.5 bat...beware.
