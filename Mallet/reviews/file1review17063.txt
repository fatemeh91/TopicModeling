review/text: My old Remington MB-10 lasted a very long time. Must be something like 10-15 years. The motor finally died, so I needed a replacement. Found something from another brand at a discount department store for ten bucks. What a piece of junk that was. I returned that that day after I bought it. Just ordered the Remington MB-200 on Amazon. If the quality is as good as my old Remington beard trimmer, I expect to be very satisfied.
