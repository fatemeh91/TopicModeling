review/text: I really don't understand what this product does, but it seems to work on aches, pains, sore muscles and the like.My wife, my mom (at 94 years of age), my children, and I love this stuff. I don't think it will help serious cases of arthritis, of cancer pain, but for the everyday problems, it's great.
