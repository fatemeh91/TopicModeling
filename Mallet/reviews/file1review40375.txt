review/text: I was getting cold symptoms, so I tried GAIA QUICK DEFENSE. Two capsules,five times a day, for two days. 20 capsules. The cold did come on; it was mild. Maybe because of the Gaia, maybe because I dropped four 1000 vitamin C pills, drank alota liquids and kept relative quiet, which I do for colds. Generally making them mild (I live at 7500-feet; there's lots of snow and cold outside m'windows; I get maybe one cold per winter, taking precautions.)So gaia HERBS could be good, or just along for the ride. Directions:20 capsules. Think I'll stick with old-fashioned remedies.
