review/text: I was surprised this product worked as well as it did. It was much creamier and smoother than I thought it would be. To tell the truth, it worked really well on my elbows as well as my feet. I also liked the peach scent. A lot of foot creams smell like peppermint, which isn't one of my more favorite scents. I work on my feet all day and I would recommend this product. Remember, it works well on other parts too, especially elbows.
