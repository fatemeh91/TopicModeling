review/text: Hubby has borderline glaucoma and his eyes started getting really dry throughout the day. The lubricating drops prescribed by the doc weren't doing the trick so (since I'm a trusted Fan of Similasan) got him a bottle of this stuff to see if it helped the gritty dry feeling. He used it twice a day or whenever and his eyes needed it and was greatly relieved.*FYI - Since I'm a herbalist as well, I also had him try (in conjunction) with the drops a herb called "Eyebright" root in capsule form. The two of these items did the trick. Last visit to the eye doctor was outstanding, pressure was normal in both eyes, she asked him what he was doing. Eyebright herb is fantastic stuff for all kinds of eye conditions/I've used it as a wash for eye problems in dogs, given internally as well it does double duty, used an eye wash in allergy season when you wake up with itchy gritty eyes. Makes your eyes seems whiter and brighter and seem to look and feel less tired after a day in front of the computer.
