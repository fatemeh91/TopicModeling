review/text: I was one of the lucky ones, I got eight months and two weeks use from my Waterpik WP-65 Personal Dental Water Jet. It works great, for a while. I plan on buying another oral irrigator but definitely NOT a Waterpik brand! This is also very loud which could be an issue for apartment dwellers.
