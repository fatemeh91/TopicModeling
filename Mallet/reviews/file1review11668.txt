review/text: I started giving this to my daughter a couple months ago at the age of 11 months. She loves taking her &#34;vitamins&#34;. I have tasted the product and it does not taste overly fishy, and tastes quite pleasant. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a fish oil product for their young child who is unable to swallow pills.
