review/text: Wow! This cream does the job!It has an unusual odor to it, but it does not bother me at all. Applies easily and immediately gives comfort! no joke!It comes with small inserts that can be used for internal application [please...only use it in the South Door]. I personally have not used it in that manner.the tubes are small but it only takes a little dab to do the job as far as surface application.I will buy it again if I ever get through the first four tubes. :-)I like how it does not contain shark oil as some other products do. We really need to stop killing our planet's life forms.
