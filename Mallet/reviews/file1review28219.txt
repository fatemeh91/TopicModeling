review/text: About a month ago I was hanging out with a group of friends and they were talking about weight and such. I have a pretty high metabolism and it is really hard for me to gain weight. For the past 5 years I have faithfully worked out and have gotten myself very toned but because of my excessive workouts I can't gain that much weight. Several friends said that I should drink protein shakes to help gain weight and increase muscle. So I searched the internet and found this Whey Protein. I purchased it and within 2-3 weeks I already felt a difference in my energy, my muscles and my work outs.I purchased the double rich chocolate and I mix it with milk. Also I sometimes put hershey chocolate syrup in it for extra carbs because weight gain is a big factor for me. I think it tastes great. Great product overall. I plan to buy again.Added: If you want a really nice chocolate taste I suggest mixing this with half milk and half yoohoo. It sounds crazy but it is incredibly tasty.
