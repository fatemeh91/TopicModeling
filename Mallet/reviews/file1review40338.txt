review/text: You can't help but be impressed by Quick Defense. There's a unique code on each box that you can punch in on Gaia's website that gives you detailed information on every single ingredient, down to the names of the technicians who ran the tests for heavy metal contamination. The future of herbal supplements is here!The only thing that would impress me more would be if Quick Defense actually worked. The scientific evidence that any of the ingredients does anything whatsoever is spotty at best, so Gaia tries to make up for in quantity what these herbs lack in efficacy: The instructions ask you to take 20 pills over the course of 2 days. And those pills cost nearly a dollar each. Nevertheless, after receiving Quick Defense, I dutifully waited until I felt a cold coming on and gorged on the pills. And the result was... a regular cold. It got worse, and then it got better, on the same timeframe as any other cold.I'm reminded of Michael Specter's TED talk where he adds up the money that Americans spend on supplements despite studies finding no discernible benefit: "It's OK, you want to pay 28 billion dollars/year for dark urine? I'm totally with you." That kind of money can make miracles happen. These pills won't.
