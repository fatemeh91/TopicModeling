review/text: If you're looking for "HEALTHY", this is the right product.Unfortunately, the calorie count isn't SUPER impressive and it's very sweet to the taste sometimes. Also, it doesn't exactly taste like "Peanut Butter". I think it's a great energy bar though. Not chocolate-covered and "healthy-fake" like other protein bars and such.
