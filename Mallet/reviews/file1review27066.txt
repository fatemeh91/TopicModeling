review/text: Got a great deal on the ON 100% Whey powder. Mixes easy using a blender bottle and doesnt taste terrible. Does leave a slight after taste like many other Whey productsHowever, wish I'd just paid a little extra and got the Natural Health Formula Dutch Chocolate which has a much better flavor.
