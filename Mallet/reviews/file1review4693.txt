review/text: *Hi im updating this, its been a while. I did not lose any weight at all with this product, at first it curbed my appetite but the effects wore off for me. I am not saying it will not work for you but give it a try. I did lose 45 lbs with atkins, just saying.Ok so I got this for like $42 at a small store I wish I would of gotten this from amazon for 12 dollars less.But I must say its delicious. I am kind of picky what I eat but this is great. Also great with water. I tried Muscle Milk before and that did not curb my appetite.I love that this gives you energy also.Today I consumed about 1700 calories and I had the energy to exercise for 1 hour 15 minutes.I am pleased with this as I am 325 lbs and never have energy to exercise and I can easily eat 3,200 calories per day. I am not hungry I feel totally fine. Might even have a yogurt as a night snack.Let's hope I can lose some weight, I've only been on this for 2 days and already have the energy to take on the world!Did I mention its delicious too?You should go to a their independent stores and try one for yourself and see which flavor you like best and then buy the tub cheaper here on amazon.
