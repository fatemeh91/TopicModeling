review/text: I'm finally gonna let this out of the bag and let others in on a little secret. This product WORKS, and might be the only thing I'll take and TRUST beside Muscle Juice (more carbs though, which I mix together to help me appreciate the blander, yet fuller scope of the quality protein in this product, comparatively). I'm gonna be honest here, I didn't initially post my rave reviews because I actually appreciated this item being in stock every time I needed to restock. Let's just say I was "testing" it to see if it was worthy of a review first!I'm not gonna talk about how much muscle I've gained using this, because user experience may vary (yada yada) and you may even gain more than me, but I will say it DOES WORK, and that you'll possibly be smarter than the masses who still over complicate the equation and falsely believe that artificial sweeteners can save you from unwanted weight gain in certain areas. Think about it, if you're taking something to gain weight (hopefully muscle) you use the nutrients for energy, right? Or you could expel it, or just not use as much...Be wise, and do your research.The 1200 version has more calories (energy) for your tenacious workout session, than the 900 (which has those terrible tasting artificial sweeteners, which the jury is STILL out on; why bother?) and it also stocks enough vitamins and minerals (you do the research) to not need to take multivitamin before or after your workout. One caveat for those of allergen concern, this product may be produced in facility that also processes shellfish, but I do have FAR GREATER trust for this company's QUALITY CONTROL system relative to other brands out there (aside from TWINLAB & NOW products, and I've tried a GREAT deal of them, and read reports on others).I love this product!
