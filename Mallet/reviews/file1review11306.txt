review/text: I have been taking this product for several weeks, and I can't take the full dose because the after taste of the pill is so strong that I only take 3 pills at night. I do like that my stomach is flatter and I don't crave sugar like I used too! Overall I think it is a good yeast cleanse and worth the money!
