review/text: I have been using this product for about a month now, and I am very satisfied. I had spent a lot of time looking for the right medication organizer, and this one had all the features I was looking for. Sturdy plastic tray holds 7 individual plastic "packs". Each pack is a different color and is separated into AM and PM. Each division is large enough to hold anything you could possibly be taking. I am able to fit all of my medications and supplements with so much room to spare. Most of the pills/capsules I take are giant "horse pills" so a large tray was a must. The packs also say closed so no pills are being spilled in my bag! I love being able to take a single day's worth of medication with me instead of carrying around a full 7 day tray. The colorful design is a plus! Great product.
