review/text: I'm a walker for exercise and I purchased these as a compromise for the expensive negative heel shoes I've seen advertised. I've only been using these insoles about two weeks, but I can already say that I feel my posture is better, and my feet feel great even after long, hilly walks. For the price, I'm very pleased with these insoles - just purchased a second pair.
