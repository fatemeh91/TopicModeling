review/text: It is extremely difficult if not impossible to determine what brush heads to order for your Sonicare toothbrush. The official Sonicare site isn't much help; they don't even have very good pictures of their products. I ordered these brush heads, but who knows if they will work. Also, the Sonicare toothbrush that my son uses has a faulty seal where the brush head meets the base, so that gunk builds up in the crevices inside. Looks like the same gunk that happens on the special brush head holder.
