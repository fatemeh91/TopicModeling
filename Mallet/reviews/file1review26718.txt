review/text: Using this product for years now, and to be honest, you really cant beat it for overall value. Optimum Nutrition is known for making quality products, and Its relatively cheap compared to other proteins out there, The Serving size is only 1 SCOOP compared to other products that require 2 scoops, which means your getting more value. It mixes very nicely with water or milk, and the taste is bearable with water, and pretty damn enjoyable with milk. As a college student its great to use when you have class and don't have time to grab an in between snack... just have a scoop of this! You can use it in the morning, and mix it in with oatmeal for extra protein and vanilla flavor.The only bad thing i could possibly say, is that there is no hydro whey which gets into your system faster, and pro-complex, which contains all essential amino acids... THAT BEING SAID, both of those products are considerably more expensive.Overall, after years of trying products, this is the best whey protein product for your money. Quality protein, for a good price.
