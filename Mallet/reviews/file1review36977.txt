review/text: Like the heft and solid feel of the handle of this one over my old one. Teeth could be sharper, but if I really want them that sharp I could always sharpen them lol. All in all, a good purchase. Wheel spins easily, teeth are fairly sharp, handle is good and solid (does not feel like I will break it by gripping too hard).
