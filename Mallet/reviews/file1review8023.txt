review/text: This was actually a replacement tweezer for my first aid kit since my darling child always happen to get a splinter or two under her skin almost every week. Since it is so sharp, I leave the cap on. I've been using tweezerman for more than tens years and will continue using them. Other than Rubis tweezers, these are the best in quality and durablity. The reason why I had to replace the tweezers was because my first aid kit was "borrowed" and never returned again along with my trusty tweezers. For more than ten years, that tweezer never had to be sharpened so I can't really rate on the FREE SHARPENING SERVICE and guarantee. Kudos also to Amazon for the quick service and delivery!
