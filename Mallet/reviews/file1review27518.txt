review/text: I am a heavy lifter, and so I need to consume lots of protein in order to recover from my workouts. I love ON whey protein. I especially love the double rich chocolate flavor, although I alternate between chocolate, strawberry and vanilla.I start out my morning with a shake made of two scoops mixed with milk, which is low in calories but great in everything I need. It also keeps me going until lunch. When I lift hard consistently, and use ON Whey Protein, I can feel the muscle growing and experience excellent gains.I will always have some on hand, and go through a tub every month or month and a half. I would definitely recommend.
