review/text: I have been using the original non-scented version for a very long time. I have psoriasis which makes it hard to find a lotion gentle enough and moisturizing enough. I also hate the greasy feeling. This lotion has all of that, and now I found a smell I like which doesn't irritate my super sensitive skin. My husband loves the smell too and he doesn't usually notice little things like that.
