review/text: My baby was extremely fussy because she was gassy and in pain. I used Mylicon and it worked so well. The only thing is that you really have to follow the directions for it to work effectively. The anitgas medicine in Mylicon is simethicone, and it works best if you give your baby the dose before the feeding rather than after the feeding. I also used Colic Calm, which is an all natural gripe water type of medicine and it just didn't work as well for my baby. First, Colic Calm is black and it stains anything and everything it gets on, including your skin. It washes off skin but does not wash off clothing. So your precious baby's clothing may get stained with black marks on it from Colic Calm. And it's just not as effective as Mylicon. Mylicon does a great job at getting rid of gas. I highly recommend this product!
