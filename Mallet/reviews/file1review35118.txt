review/text: I purchased this product and have tried it in a few recipes such as pancakes and brownies, as well as simply cooking it with oat bran.The strong sawdust-like taste is very difficult to mask. I've thrown out everything I've made with it so far because the flavor was just a bit too strong.This product is best used as only a very small fraction of whatever it is used in, but on the whole I would look to more palatable sources of fiber.For a better tasting fiber for bulky baked items, defatted coconut flour has a much better taste and having the ability to be used as a much, much greater proportion in a recipe.
