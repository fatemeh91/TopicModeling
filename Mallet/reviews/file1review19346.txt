review/text: It fits a 9.5 inch deep mattress very well. It is soft and doesn't make crackling noises like the cheaper vinyl versions. I wasn't sure it was waterproof so I put a gallon of water in it and it was completely dry on the bottom about five hours later. The water is retained between the layers, so you can't air dry it. Putting it in the dryer at low heat works fine, though. The sides are not waterproof. If you need that you'll have to get one of the vinyl covers.
