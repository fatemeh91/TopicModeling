review/text: I am being treating with a new protocol for non-diabetic Peripheral Neuropthy which requires six injections of a Novacain type substance per foot for 8 visits. Well the skin started itching due to the sticky surface of the bandaids put on the area that recieved the injections. This was not a small itch, it was so intense it woke me up at night and I developed a rash. I aways get a rash from a bandaid or anything with stickey surface that comes in contace with my skin. My doctor gave me a sample of Herb Pharm Original Salve which I applied to all the areas that were used for the injections and whala no more itch. It is a great product to have around the house and when on vacation. I will not be without it as a result of my very postitive experience.
