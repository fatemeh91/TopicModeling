review/text: One of the best protein powders available on the market. I bought the last one at GNC for almost 10 bucks more. It is a good deal from Amazon. Double rich Chocolate flavor. Taste is pretty good if you drink it with non-fat milk. Tastes better and mixes better than the GNC brand protein. This is my usual after-workout drink. I will most likely order my next one from Amazon too.
