review/text: This whey powder has a lot of proteins and will help you develop your muscles if you have a regular trainign routine. This product won't work if taken alone without excersicing.Best served cold. The chocolate flavor is kinda artifical, vanilla is great. Enhance the flavor by adding some milk and a fruit (like a banana).
