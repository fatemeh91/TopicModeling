review/text: I have used a corded Eltron 770 for many years with excellent results. After reading the reviews of the Braun 8585 I decided to buy one. My first surprise was to find little metal and much plastic in the 8585 construction. My second surprise was the modest power of the 8585 compared with the Eltron 770. The 8585 slows down when it contacts whiskers, something that never happens using the corded Eltron 770. Removing a three-day growth of beard with the 8585 was a time-consuming chore with mixed results. Removing the same amount of beard with the Eltron 770 was quick, easy and yielded excellent results. On a scale of one to ten I'd give the Eltron 770 a nine. I'd give the Braun 8585 a five.
