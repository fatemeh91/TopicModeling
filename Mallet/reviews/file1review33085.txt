review/text: My oldest son got me started on the Wellness Formula Herbal Defense Complex last fall when I came down with a terrible cold while on vacation. He told me to start taking the maximum recommended amount each day to help fight my cold symptoms & get well faster. I really think that taking the Wellness capsules seemed to help shorten the time it took me to get better from that cold. I have continued to take the daily recommended amount, along with my other daily vitamin supplements & prescription medicines, just to maintain better health. This June I got another cold and I increased the daily dosage to the maximum amount; this time the cold seemed to go away even faster than before! Hooray for Wellness Formula!!
