review/text: Purchased this product a few weeks ago for my tween son. He started with one wart on his foot but soon others developed. Previously we were using Dr. Sch**** for several weeks and it just had a minor effect on the warts. So, after some research I decided to give Pedifix a shot. It is working very effectively so far! No pain at all when he applies it. This is my 1st review written on Amazon, but not my 1st reading of reviews. I glean a lot of info from reading and analyzing reviews. I am glad I chose this product.
