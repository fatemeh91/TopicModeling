review/text: Vitamins have always made me nauseous and weak. When I became pregnant I tried to take 2 different types of vitamins my ob/gyn prescribed. They were in my stomach for about 20 minutes on average before I got sick. Finally I found this product in Target and it worked great! My doctor checked them out and said they were all I needed. I took 1/2 pill in the morning and half at night and always on a full stomach. I also took an additional DHA supplement. They do taste funky especially if you break them, but so do all vitamins. I wash 'em down with juice. My baby is 13 months old and I'm still taking them!
