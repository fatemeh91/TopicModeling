review/text: Thank goodness I bought these. I have tennis elbow in both elbows because of my career. (Flower design.) I have been suffering for quite awhile and I just got these braces and put them on and I can immediately feel a difference. My fiance better watch out, I can already tell this will help my bowling! A great relief for a great price!
