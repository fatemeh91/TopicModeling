review/text: These vitamins are great. They are the cheapest pro-biotic, whole food vitamins out there but that is a big side bonus for me. These vitamins have a great proportion of nutrients that a pregnant woman needs. I actually had been a big proponent of New Chapter vitamins and my husband and I took the multivitamin for several years. However, when I looked into their New Chapter prenatal vitamins and not only do you have to take three a day, but they are almost no different from the daily multivitamin (but MUCH more expensive-$44 for 2 months) but they lack the iron and calcium levels a pregnant woman needs. These are the best!
