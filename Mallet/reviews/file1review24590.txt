review/text: I started Zantrex 3 on the recommended dosage, two pills before a major meal. Within fifteen minutes I was nauseated, had the shakes, a headache, and a stomachache for the rest of the day. The next day I took only one pill before breakfast and still felt sick the entire day. There is hardcore caffeine in these that leaves you feeling dope sick even after you stop taking it. I had fitful sleep when I finally did fall asleep, even though I hadn't taken a pill in over ten hours. The prospect of losing fifteen pounds in two weeks does not outweigh how horrible you feel while you're taking the pill.
