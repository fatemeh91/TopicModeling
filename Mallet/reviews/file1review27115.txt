review/text: My first try was Strawberry and Banana which was amazing. Even after reading those bad reviews about it's taste, my second choice was still cookies and cream...BAD decision... It leaves a terrible feeling in my stomach after every protein shake I have. Can't wait to get rid of this junk and go back to strawberry and banana...
