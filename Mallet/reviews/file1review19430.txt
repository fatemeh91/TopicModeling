review/text: Do not buy this product if you have kids of any age. My two daughters, aged 17 and 12, both came running from their rooms immediately after I plugged the unit into a wall socket complaining of a horrible noise. My eldest described it as if there were a million crickets screeching into a microphone. As such, this product is unusable in my home. It would be nice if the product documentation gave fair warning.
