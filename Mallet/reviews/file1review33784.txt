review/text: I'd heard great thing from my waxer about this product, but wasn't terribly impressed. It is alcohol based, and it makes me think that regular rubbing alcohol could do the same job. Didn't do anything "magical" to ingrown hairs, just dried the skin, and kind of brought them to the surface (same result as rubbing alcohol). Okay product, but you might be better off with a home remedy of rubbing alcohol.
