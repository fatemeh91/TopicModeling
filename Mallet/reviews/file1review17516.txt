review/text: For the price, this was an ok investment. It is compact, but it doesn't hold a charge very well. If it's out of juice, you can't just plug it in and run it. You have to wait for it to charge and then run it. In addition, the beard trimmings go everywhere. In the end, the hassle of this device lead me to shave off my beard. It's easier to just shave in the shower, plus I look 10 years younger.
