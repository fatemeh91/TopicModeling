review/text: Quick delivery. the pills are large but go down easy. no weird smells or aftertaste! I like that I do not have to take a seperate prenatal vitamin. I will use these daily until our IUI scheduled in December. Keeping fingers crossed that this product will enhance my mucous and ovulation so we only have to do procedure one time. My doctor does not want us doing Clomid yet so after lots of research I purchased these. My husband is happy since he prefers I do as much natural as possible as I have had side effects form various prescriptions I have taken daily for about a month and it seems like mucous is improved. I suggest you get the book " A Cooperative Method of Natural Birth Control" by Margaret Nofziger. She goes into great detail about charting your temps, and checking mucous etc...Good luck to all those TTC!!
