review/text: This is the first stainless steel cleaner I've bought, but I sure thought it'd work better than it did. It left streaks until I went back with a dry rag and wiped it hard...but after that it stayed looking nice for a few days (I have a 1 year old and a messy 4 year old). So I like it after all is said and done, but it's a lotta work.
