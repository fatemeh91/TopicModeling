review/text: The Hummingbird product is, basically, a cell phone vibration mechanism with a plastic toothpick attached. These replacement attachments do not hold any value for a person that has a serious investment in their teeth. A regular toothpick provides more rigid action while being less cumbersome.I promise you that the free toothpicks at any place you eat will beat this gimmicky Hummingbird product, hands down.
