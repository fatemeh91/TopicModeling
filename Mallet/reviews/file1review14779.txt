review/text: Ask yourself... Why Parisi's reviews are always the first and the oldest review on hundreds of supplements, few years ahead of any other review written by anyone else and that is the same situation not for one review but for hundreds of review and all those reviews with high scores for the seller and the product itself.READ THE COMMENT BY GREAT COOK IN PARISI'S REVIEW... Astonishing... Parisi's review is dated 2005 and the next review is dated 2007. I guess no one ever purchased any of these supplements for few years in between or if they did, they had no opinion at all. Parisi even claims that he/she has been consuming all those supplements for years before writing the review. Majority of Parisi's reviews are set like that and even though in many of his/her reviews Parisi is reminded that his/her review is misleading in Perisis's comment section by other individuals, Parisi fails to respond or update his/her comments for some seven years. Meantime Parisi claims in many of his/her comments [I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY]... No one can afford to swallow down that many supplements a day. No honest individual would let his/her review go so many years without updating such review if they are reminded by others that is misleading time after time.
