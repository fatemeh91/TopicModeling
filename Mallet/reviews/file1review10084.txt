review/text: I work at CVS and these can be found on sale for around dollar a bottle, so if your neighborhood has a drugstore check it out to see if you can find it for cheaper.Now let's get to the product. I'll keep it short and get straight to the point. I've seen many people complain about how they are watered down and does not provide long lasting smell, well all I have to say to you my fellow amazon shoppers is to ignore them. The clean linen has been one of my favorite smell ever since I was a kid, reminds me of when my mom would be done with the laundry and ask me to help her fold, so it has a little meaning to me. The smell isn't strong, but it is just enough so everytime your in the area you sprayed, you will be able to smell it and it won't be to overpowering which is very pleasant. I usually spray it around the house in the morning before I leave for work and when I come back later on, the house smells fresh and clean. So you get the idea that it lasts pretty long and you won't have to worry about continously spraying for a good smell. Honestly, for the price per bottle this product is great and gets the job done. If you really love the smell of one of these sprays, do not hesitate because you won't be dissapointed.Fun Fact: At my workplace we use these to keep the store smelling fresh and customers always give us compliments and usually end up picking up a bottle.
