review/text: This is the second time I have been on the herbalife diet. The first time was great, I lost weight, lost inches, and I felt great. This second time, I haven't been doing it very long this time, but I already feel better and feel like I lost weight. I wanted to go back on the herbalife diet, not just because of past exprience, but becuse the products are more natural. I considered using other dietary suppliments, but was uncomfortable with the idea of their ingredients.This shake is best used with other shapeworks products like the multivitamin and the cell activator. the shakes taste good too. You just mix two scoops of it with 8oz of milk (i also add 2-3 ice cubes in a blender) and enjoy. You can have one shake a day for weight management or two shakes a day for weight loss. As a meal replacement, the shakes don't completly fill you up, but definatly don't leave you hungry.
