review/text: please don't buy into the hype or the hope that you'll find an easy, simple way to achieve a huge jump in physical well-being. The results of this product are totally unsupported scientifically and psychosomatic when consumers rave about it. I tried the product with the Cleanse and Colon pill pre-treatment. Absolutely no benefit. I didn't feel any better, lose any weight, feel any stronger or lighter or clear-headed. Scam.
