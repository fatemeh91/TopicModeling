review/text: PURCHASED THIS FOR MY HUSAND. HE IS VERY PARTICULAR ABOUT HIS GROOMING TOOLS AND LOVES THIS ITEM. THE FEATURE HE APPRECIATES THE MOST IS THE ABILITY TO ADJUST THE BLADE HEIGHT WITHOUT HAVING TO CHANGE ANYTHING. THIS ITEM REPLACED AN OLDER MODEL. HOPE IT LASTS AS LONG AS THE FIRST ONE DID. THESE DAYS 10 YEARS IS A GOOD LIFE SPAN FOR SOMETHING THAT IS RECHARGEABLE.
