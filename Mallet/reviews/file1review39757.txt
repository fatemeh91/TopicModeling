review/text: Its meant for books hence the pencil slot in the side...I love this- met the creator at a street fair and only wished i had found this before the end of my master's program.. Sure the catch at the end is inconvenient if you are trying to type (don't think that was what it was made for), but it definately holds your laptop in an array of angles for viewing ppoints, movies, whatever..But BOOKS actual paper pages, this thing rocks. I have since given 3 to friends and often recommend them for people with neck problems due to forward head posture. Proper positioning allows for people to level their heads as they read in bed, or sitting in a chair or on the floor w cushions as i often find myself...So just be clear what your intention of use is.
