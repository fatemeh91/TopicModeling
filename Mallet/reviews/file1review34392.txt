review/text: The lubricant itself is the best I've ever tried. This is the way to buy it - the smaller containers at the pharmacy or supermarket are way more expensive per ounce of product. As for the design of the container as a dispenser, I agree it leaves a lot to be desired. However, my solution was to pour off some of the product into a little spray bottle with a really small hole, and use that as a dispenser - not as a spray.
