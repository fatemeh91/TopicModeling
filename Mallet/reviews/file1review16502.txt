review/text: The description of the product was thus: Ingredients per Daily Serving of THREE (3) Glucosamine Chondroitin Joint Health Complex capsules: Glucosamine Sulfate 1,500 mg - Chondroitin Sulfate 1,200 mg - Essential Fatty Acids 30 IU - Vitamin C 75However the bottle's label says it contains only 500mg glucosamine sulfate, and 400mg chondroitin. I will contact the seller to see what's up.
