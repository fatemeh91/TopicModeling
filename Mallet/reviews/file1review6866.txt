review/text: I use this to view my negatives and slides in photography. It is a nice handy loupe. It is a little bit bigger than I expected and you will not be able to use it in a way similar to other loupes (that is putting it in your eye and lodging it there). However, it is great if you have something that you can set on a flat surface and use this to view that item. The clear plastic ring lets light in which adds to the visibility of an item. I would not say this is the most sturdy/heavy item you can buy for this purpose but for the price and for the way I use it, it has held up very well.
