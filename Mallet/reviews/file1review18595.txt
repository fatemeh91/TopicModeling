review/text: I needed a larger cuff size for obese patients. The product indicates that it is a large size 13-17". When it arrived it was the standard size 9 - 17" which is no different than the one that I already have. The message from the company before I ordered had not been clear that this cuff would not solve my problem. The company refuses to accept returns although the product has never been used. I wasted my money on this purchase.
