review/text: First, let me start by saying I was out of shape and overweight before the pregnancy (180lb, now at 205lb at 30 weeks) and short (5'2"), so it was inevitable that I would have a lot of discomfort in the last trimester of my pregnancy. I bought this on recommendation of my doctor for some severe pelvic instability issues that was causing pain with walking and stairs. With that being said, I think that you should consider what you're buying this for and what you're hoping to accomplish before you judge the cons of this product.CONS:It makes me look even fatter - because of all the bulges it creates under my clothing. This is due to my being out of shape and overweight though, as no amount of support could be given if it were loose enough NOT to create bulges.Its not east to put on, and requires a bit of adjustment after moving around a lot.Its bright white! Easy to see under dark clothing.The straps that cross in the front are visible at the neck line of all but turtle neck tops - and I have not found a way to pin them out of the way without it pulling on the item and my under clothing in a worse way (the cross of the straps is at the center of my chest).PROS:The pressure is relieved. Not 100%, but relieved enough to make the inconveniences worth it. I don't believe this is for someone who is experiencing manageable pain. This is for someone who is at their wits end and realizes they have months to go and they are willing to look a bit unflattering for some pain relief.
