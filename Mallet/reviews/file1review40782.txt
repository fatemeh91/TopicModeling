review/text: i'd used the women's gilette sensor since i started shaving as a 6th grader over a decade ago - but on a good friend's recommendation, i decided to experiment with an upgrade. i've been using the intuition for a few months now, and it's the closest shave i've ever achieved - no razor burn, no knicks.i love that the razor and lather are all-in-one. i think it's so convenient..even if it does wear down a little unevenly - it conditions my legs and makes them super-soft. and i think my hair's been growing back with less density, plus it seems to grow in slower, lighter, and softer - brilliant!i love the grip of the razor, just the whole appearance of the design. i tried the venus razor a couple years ago and was really disappointed, but the intuition has my full vote of confidence.
