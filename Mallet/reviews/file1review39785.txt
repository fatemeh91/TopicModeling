review/text: I used to be able to buy Orange Oil furniture polish locally, but when I couldn't find it any more I was so disappointed. I am so glad that I found it again because it is so good for my wood furniture and the wood just shines as if it were new. Orange Oil also leaves a clean, fresh scent after it's use. I love it!
