review/text: I bought Optimum Nutrition Whey protein this time because there was more protein than their competitors.When I tried ON protein the first time I found the drink to be thin and runny. but the flavor was good.This time it is even thinner than before, and the flavor is almost non existent.I have tried ON whey protein, twice, GNC whey protein, and two others that I will not name because their consistency was like mixing water and sand.For flavor and consistency so far I MUCH prefer the GNC proteinI recommend you avoid Optimum Whey Protein if taste and consistency are important to you
