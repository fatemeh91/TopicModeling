review/text: This "boo boo" soother has an adorable, machine washable terry cloth cover, but the small, round, soft plastic insert that you freeze is not effective. The insert isn't large enough to soothe most boo boos and the coolness dissipates long before the boo boo stops hurting. I would look for something larger.
