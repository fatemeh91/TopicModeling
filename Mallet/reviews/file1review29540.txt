review/text: Good way to drink loose tea. The bombilla is a very sturdy metal and appealing to look at. It is, as others have mentioned, a bit shorter than it looks from my photo. Mine measures about 6.7" inches long. Maybe that is normal if using a gourd, but it's shorter than I expected.Minor detail there, I'm otherwise very happy with the product.
