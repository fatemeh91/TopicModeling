review/text: I think we all share similar stories. My husband and I have been TTC for the past 2-3 years. I have normal cylces and ovulate, but it just hasn't happend for us. We visited an infertility specialist, results were normal for both of us leaving us more confused as to why I can't get pregnant. After 3 IUI's,shots and doctor visits we have considered IVF for 2011 if we cannot conceive this year. I have pretty much tried everything. After reading several reviews for this product, I figured I'd give this one a chance. I ordered the 3 month supply pack. I received my order and have began taking the pills 3/9/10. Not bad, the capsules do not have a bad taste, smell and so far so good-no changes. The real test will be in the next few months. Hopefully, with good news to share! Baby dust for everyone... Good luck and for those that have acheived results, keep posting them! Your story and review is one of the reasons I decided to try this product. :)
