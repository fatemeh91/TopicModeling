review/text: I purchased this after looking at a lot of reviews. The mineral make up is very good and the price was ok, but once I got the product, the pills are solid, somewhat hard to swallow and they tasted strange. I had to drink a reasonable amount of liquid to get the taste out of my mouth. I must say that after a month or so I got used to the taste. Also a good thing is you only need to take 2 pills/day. I decided to try a different product that requires 3 pills/day for the same amount but they are capsules, much easier to swallow and actually cost less.
