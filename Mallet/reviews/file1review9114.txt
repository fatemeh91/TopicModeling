review/text: I strive to eat two salads a day. I'm lucky if I eat one. And while I do not eat processed foods, it is very, very easy for me to fall into a habit of eating the same things day after day after day.I got this to cover the bases on eating/not eating vegetables. I also like how many probiotics it has in it.It is very easy to drink. There's barely any taste, and what's there at all is a faintly sweet (very faint) grassy taste. I have tried other ground up superfood drinks in the past and didn't stick with them, mostly because I kind of dreaded drinking them. This doesn't bother me.If I could have any complaint about Green Vibrance, it is that it needs to be kept in the refrigerator or, even better, in the freezer after it's opened. That's not a problem 95% of the time, but when I'm traveling, it's a pain. The company does offer this in packets, but the cost of each serving in the packets is MUCH higher than the cost from these larger tubs.Eh - I'll still be using it... I'll just end up spending a bit more money. It's worth it.
