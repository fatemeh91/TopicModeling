review/text: I have psoriasis on my face. It was diagnosed by a dermatologist earlier this year. I have been usingPsoriasin Psoriasis Relief, Multi-Symptom, Topical Ointment, 4 oz.ever since the diagnosis. It was working well at first, but the effectiveness is falling off a bit, so I switched to this for a week to see if it would work better.Unfortunately, this did not work better. I do like that it does not smell funny, it does not sting, it did not make my face redder or my psoriasis worse, but it did not make any improvements, either. After the third day of using this, all the scaliness and redness came back, exactly like what happens when I stop using the psoriasin for three days.I'm giving this two stars because it does not work for me. I can't say "it's okay" which is the definition of a three star review, because it is not okay in terms of actually improving my psoriasis. It makes no difference. But I am grateful that at least it was not super-expensive and it did not make my face look worse.
