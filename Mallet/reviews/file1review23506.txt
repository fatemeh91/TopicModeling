review/text: If you have IBS this will help, a lot! I am on my second can of this and it has improved my syptoms of IBS, I will continue to buy. I like that it is tasteless and can be mixed in food or into drinks. I have used other otc products but none have helped me, Heather's works! Give it a try, I think you will be glad you did!
