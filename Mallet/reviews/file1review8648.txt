review/text: I sort of can't believe I'm leaving a review for a scrub brush, but this is truly a much MUCH better product than the ones I'd been using before. Previously I'd thought that any brush would do, and just nabbed one at the CVS or Walgreens. But this brush has made me realize that cleaning could have been easier.I use this to scrub my bathroom sinks, primarily (with a handy mix of baking soda and cinnamon), and it doesn't scratch them at all. It also seems to glide over surfaces more effectively, while also giving them a thorough cleaning.Am definitely getting a second one of these for my kitchen sink.
