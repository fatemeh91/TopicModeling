review/text: I've been on the subscribe and save for a few months. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I have had no problems with this detergent dissolving. I have a top loading Kenmore than is about 5 years old and we do about 13 loads of laundry a week and we have hard water. This is an excellent price with no sales tax and free shipping. And no fragrances or unwanted chemicals in the soap...
