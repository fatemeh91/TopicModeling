review/text: This Fall I would not have been able to beta test an excellent game for Jeff Vogel if it wasn't for this glove! My hand and elbow start hurting quite a bit and the tendons are inflamed within minutes if I forget to put it on. I can wear it while doing some light typing but for writing things like this review I do have to remove it. So I highly recommend it for heavy use of the mouse.
