review/text: I don't care for meat, fish or chicken for that matter. This is why I buy protein shakes in order to get some protein. I came across a small package of Strawberry/Banana Spiru-Tein. I took out my hand blender, I added a little 2% milk, water and some fresh mango slides (frozen from the season) and OMG: I am hooked!!! Even my husband, who doesn't care for protein shakes likes this one. It tastes sooo good, we have to wonder: is it Healthy??Either way: I am getting the biggest Container I can find! It tastes more like Strawberry than Banana. Adding fresh strawberries will only make it taste even better! (but not needed). I'd blend it well and add crush ice to it. Enjoy! :).
