review/text: One product that does it all. Originally I purchase it for Tinea Versicolor but it does much more. It is now my body wash from head to toe. I use it on my face for acne. A great body wash for anyone with sensitive skin. It gives you a mint fresh feeling cause it has peppermint in it. I can shave my leg with it and it will leave it smooth. And on top of all that I wash my hair with it cause it is all natural and it is does a great job handling dandruff. I love this stuff. Try it for yourself.
