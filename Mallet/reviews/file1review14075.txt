review/text: Most diaper hangers have one compartment for a big stack of disposables. We use a variety of cloth diapers and this organizer is great because it has space to hold our prefolds, fitteds, doublers, pockets and inserts, and covers. I haven't loaded heavy things onto it, but I've never had a problem with the shelves being unstable as another reviewer did.
