review/text: I am glad that I purchased this product. It does a very nice job of cleaning the dishwasher, stove and refrigerator. My kitchen is very small and this causes our appliances to get dirtier than I think they would in a larger kitchen. I have used this product for several months now and it makes them look like new. The only disadvantage would be that the wipes make your hands feel greasy for a little bit, but that is easily taken care of by washing them. Overall, loved this product.
