review/text: Regarding the taste, I find it much better to use milk or a combination of milk and water. Water-only mixing isn't the smoothest drink, and I've found it tough to dissolve all the particles. If you can manage to find some milk or wait till you get home, you'll be treated to a much better shake.Regarding nutritional aspects, I really can't say. So far so good.
