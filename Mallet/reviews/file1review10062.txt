review/text: I thought that the heating unit was okay. It took a lot longer than I expected to heat up, but when it did, it seemed to do an okay job. The stones however, were WAY too small and very rough. The quality of the stones was of lesser quality than what my husband, and 3 kids, could have picked up on a family outing. I was so excited when I ordered this item, and SO disappointed when I received it.
