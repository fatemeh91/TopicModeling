review/text: This seems to be the most popular whey protein powder on the market. It is cheaper than most other professional whey powders and comes in a vast variety of flavors. It mixes well in water or milk but tastes better with milk in my opinion.As for building muscle, I guess it works...I have tried some other brands of whey protein powders and settled on this one mainly due to its price and availability. I am not a supplement junkie so I am not adding pounds of muscle every week but I am slowly working up towards my goal with nothing but this protein powder and a bottle of Centrum multivitamin for supplements.
