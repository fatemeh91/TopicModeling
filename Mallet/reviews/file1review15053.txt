review/text: I have used this product before after a beach trip and the rotties came home with fles. It worked great!!!!! I needed it again this year and was so happy after not finding in the stores to see it on amazon. It works, but not over night but there is no harmful chemicals like the commercial ones that effect nerves of the flees so what does it do to my dog? Try it! I also tried the out door power/spray and it work great
