review/text: Its a simple yet effect machine that does exactly what it was designed to do. the lack of electricity dependence is great because it allows you to just grab and use it any and every time you see something on the floor. a quick 1-2. wont replace a proper vacuum, but will extend the time between vacuuming by a great deal.
