review/text: This product is much better than medication to cure aches and pains. It warms nicely in the microwave and stays warm for quite a while. The only concern I will share is not to keep it in the microwave for the listed times...using 1 minute increments guarantees warmth without melting. If the pellets/rice/herbs within get too hot they might melt the nylon-type covering. Something to be aware of. The comfort and durability of fabric on the exteriorconsistent pain relief from using it far outweighs any other tiny issues.
