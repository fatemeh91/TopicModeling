review/text: I purchased this for my 4 year old thinking it would be a great nightlight. Not a good idea for young children because the glass ball is not attached and is very heavy. Consequently,it will break things if thrown ( the glass ball will not break or crack very well made) anyways... the light projected is VERY dim. It did not project on the ceiling or the walls. Also the sound quality is barely audible. Only two of the six sound was average quality. I bought mine for $19.99 and it was thrown away within two weeks. Spend your money on something else....it just doesnt do the job.
