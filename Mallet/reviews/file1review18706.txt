review/text: Comfort Products is a joke. I have phoned (800) 971-4630 many times over the past few weeks. They provide an option for consumer customer support. After phoning the number you press 2, then 2 a second time for consumer information. The line clicks dead each and every time. If you select option 1 for dealers you can get through. They will attempt to transfer you. You might even be able to leave a message for an Andrew. You will NEVER get a call back. That's NEVER. The controls on my chair are intermittently failing. The chair is almost new. I would never buy anything again with the brand name Comfort Products. Buy it and you're on your own. JM
