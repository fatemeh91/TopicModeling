review/text: I got one of these and the blades would spin for just a bit before the unit stopped even with a fresh battery. Starting and stopping all the time was a pain. It also got hot if I tried to run it long enough to boldly probe where no nostril has been probed before. It didn't cut too well either, leaving plenty of hairs still poking up after multiple passes. Quick learner that I am, I bought another one, just in case. That had all the same faults and also kept coming apart. So much for my reputation as a boy genius. Spare yourself the trouble and get something better.
