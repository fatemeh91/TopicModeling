review/text: When I ordered this, I expected it would be a few points off, but in the doctor's office, the diastolic (bottom number) was an exact match and the systolic (top number) was two numbers higher. We compared several times with the doctor's BP cuff and it was consistent. However, when I used it the way the instructions said, with my arm crossed over my chest, it was WAY off. My suggestion is that if you purchase this, you simply prop up your arm to elevate it to heart level. It was very accurate when used like that. Impressive little product!
