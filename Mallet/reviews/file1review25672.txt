review/text: I have tried a number of others over the years and this is the only one that works really well. Safe and effective, yes it tickles, but it works great. Sure, it will probably break if you drop it enough, but it really is well made. I am ordering another due to blades getting dull after 3 years use. Probably others as good but I don't think you will find better and I know from experience you can do worse.
