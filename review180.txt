review/summary: Clear skin, lighter menstrual cramps
review/text: I first started taking this because I saw it on Dr. OZ as a remedy for menstrual cramps, well what I saw on Dr. OZ was actually "Chaste Tree Extract" but I have not been able to find that. This is probably the same thing because it works. I started taking it a few days before I expected my period and continued until my period was over and my cramps were not as agonizing as they usually are. I soon started to notice that my hormonal acne (Nodulocystic acne on my chin) was not as bad when taking these supplements so I started taking it every day. That led to the unexpected "problem" of me not getting my period for several months. I got a little scared and went to the doctor about it. She told me to stop taking it and sure enough I got my period a few months later. I didn't take this stuff for a while because of the whole messing with my cycle thing, I figured it would be best not to do that, but recently my hormonal acne has been raging again, no amount of acne cream was making it go away so I started taking this again and it went away within a few days. I figure, maybe I can treat this stuff like the birth control pill (not for birth control obviously) but to even out my hormones and I can stop taking it for a week or so to make sure I don't go months without a period. At the time I was also taking St. Johns Wart which I am no longer taking, so that could have been the cause of my missed periods since it seems that everyone else reports more regular periods on this herb.
