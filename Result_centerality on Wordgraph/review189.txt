review/summary: I love this!
review/text: I was diagnosed with PCOS after I had my 4th baby. Weight gain, had not had a regular period since I got pregnant (2 years), and all the fun bs that goes with pcos. After trying 6 months on Metformin, I went to the health food store in town and they suggested this. I now have regular 6 day periods (from 15+ days of hell), mood swings are under control, excess hair growth is slowing, and the pain from the cysts is much better. I recommend you at least TRY this product if you have PCOS, I take 3 pills 2x daily.
