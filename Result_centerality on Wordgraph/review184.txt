review/summary: Works the same way progesterone does
review/text: This works! It is AMAZING! It helps your body to produce progesterone. You don't need to take progesterone if you take this. It made a huge difference with my emotional symptoms before my period. I am like a new person! And it helped with spotting that I was having from not having enough progesterone. I didn't have to take the risky progesterone my doctor wanted me to take- I cured myself with this. Make sure that you take the Vitex that is the extract with .5% Agnuside (this one). Don't take the one that is just Chaste Tree fruit. It does nothing and it's a shame that they make it because people might try it and think that Vitex doesn't work. I want every woman who is suffering needlessly to discover Vitex because it helped me SO much!
