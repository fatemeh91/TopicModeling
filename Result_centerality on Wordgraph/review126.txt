review/summary: Socks for Cast
review/text: The package came ahead of schedule and in a nick of time because it started to get really cold, snowy with freezing rain and these socks came in handy to keep my toes warm and dry over my CAST. I plan on buying more because it is really nasty weather up here in New England and I have to wash them often. Also these look a lot better than others posted/advertised on Amazon because some look just like a surgeons mask instead of a sock.
