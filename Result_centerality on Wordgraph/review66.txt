review/summary: Feels great until it melts and then explodes.
review/text: I had another infrared massager before this one that I used for years to help with sore muscles and a nasty TMJ condition. It finally shorted out and I bought this product just a few weeks ago. I had one of the worst headaches of my entire life yesterday and was using this on my jaw when I most unfortunately fell asleep. I guess muscle relaxers and vicodin will do that to you. Anyway, when I woke up, I found that I had rolled over and the infrared massager was underneath my pillow. It completely melted and burned through my sheets and a couple inches into my mattress. I had fallen asleep a few times with my other infrared massager with no consequences so this surprised and dismayed me. This is not a safe product - it either needs to be made of sturdier material than cheap plastic or have a timer on it - I would certainly be willing to pay the extra money to not have to worry about setting fire to my house or burning myself. Sorry - can't recommend it.
