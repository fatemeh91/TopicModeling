review/summary: Good for travel
review/text: I've always had pain in my legs during long travels either by car or plane when you can't move very much. I used them for a recent trip consisting on 6 flights total and I could feel the difference. I wasn't totally stiff when I got off the planes. They do stay in place with the band at the top. Just be careful they tear as easily as stockings. If you'll use them much you better get a couple of extra pairs.
