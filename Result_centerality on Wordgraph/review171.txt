review/summary: Regulator! Mount up ;)
review/text: I started taking Vitex after reading about it on many fertility sites. My husband and I have been trying to conceive for over 6 months and are trying everything to make it happen before he deploys. I have always had irregular periods- even my first one was. I had been on birth control mainly to regulate my periods before meeting my husband, and then afterwards to prevent pregnancy. I was having two periods a month or one every 45 days- just all over the map. Since coming off of birth control 7 months ago, my cycles would vary in length between 25 and 35 days. It was driving me crazy having to wonder for weeks at a time if I was just "late" again or if I was pregnant. Then when the cycles were shorter, my luetal phase was not long enough to carry out implantation, thsu preventing pregnancy. So I ordered Vitex. I have had a regular 27 day cycle for four months now. I can even pinpoint the exact day I will start my period which has NEVER happened. I will be taking this from now on instead of birth control (after a pregnancy- hopefully!) to regulate my cycles. I highly reccomend it.
