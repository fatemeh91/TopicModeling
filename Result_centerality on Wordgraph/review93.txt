review/summary: Forget the flu shot
review/text: I have been using this product for many years now. Granted I eat a mediteranian diet with loads of fruits and vegatables and fish, so I have generally good health. But I also us a small dose of this daily in my Kombusha/Greentea mix and it works fantastic. During the cold and flu season I just up the dosage a bit. I still catch colds but it never gets past the stage of just starting to come down with it. Never becomes a full blown cold. Why pay for terrible medical care when you can care for yourself in a much friendlier healthier manner?
