review/summary: Meets my needs, would purchase again
review/text: At this price (although twice what I've seen it on store shelves), I'm very satisfied. I purchased this gadget to apply semi-deep warmth and relieve swelling and congestion in sinus areas. Its strength is low enough that I can hold it to skin for a longer period of time than some other infrared devices, giving the heat time to do its job and provide comfort. Bonus: it increases blood flow to the skin, smoothing and healing irritated areas. Because of its low wattage I don't have to worry much about being overzealous and causing damage. Only complaint: the threaded plastic where the red cap screws onto the base is thin, a little too much pressure when screwing it back on and the plastic will crack.
