review/text: My doctor recommended the thigh high version of this product, but I became very aggravated with them constantly rolling down through the course of the day. They were never comfortable. With my doctor's permission, I switched over to the knee highs, and they are WONDERFUL!!! I don't even know I'm wearing them! They totally control my calf aching and swelling. Would highly recommend them!!!
