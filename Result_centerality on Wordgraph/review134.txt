review/summary: Perfect for post-surgery footwear
review/text: I recently had surgery on my ankle after breaking it pretty badly & needed to find socks to wear under my brace (aircast boot). My doc said I could just wear my own socks, but my own socks are way too tight to comfortably wear with my swollen foot & ankle. I found these & they're perfect to comfortably fit without putting any pressure on my incredibly sensitive foot. The only con would be the price - not sure why it's so expensive to make what are basically incredibly lightweight mesh socks (they do have extra padding on the feet, but they're still very light/thin socks). But ultimately, they're worth the price for me (so much so I'm buying a second pair).
