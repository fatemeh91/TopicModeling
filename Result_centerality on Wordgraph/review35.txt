review/text: I had a very bad chest cold and didn't want to take a lot of meds. I knew I had to cough to get all that yucky stuff out of my lungs but there were times I thought I would pass out from coughing. Thank goodness for this throat spray. When I could not stop coughing, it helped to settle the cough enough so I could catch my breath! Cough drops just took to long to work and were too sweet. I am always going to have this one in my medicine chest.
