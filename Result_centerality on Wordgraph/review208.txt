review/summary: Good support, but expensive and not durable!
review/text: I tried these Jobst 15-20 mmHg pantyhose in my search for high quality therapeutic support pantyhose for a severe circulation problem in one of my legs. I did find them a little difficult to put on, but once they were on they stayed in place nicely and provided great support.The only problem I had was, like the other review stated...they ran the second time I wore them. For as expensive as these pantyhose are, they should last longer than 2 wearings.They are not too sheer, if that is something you are looking for in support hose. They look more like tights when they are on your legs. I did find the beige shade to be a little more like a pale nude shade.
