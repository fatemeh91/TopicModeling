review/summary: Super easy to take, recommended by my nutritionist
review/text: I went to a nutritionist and had two different brands of vitamin k. The other brand I had she told me was doing absolutely nothing for me, a waste of my money. But this vitamin k bottle from solaray was definitely benefitting me. So I would recommend this brand you all.
