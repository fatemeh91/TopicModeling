review/summary: This producct is amazing!
review/text: As the other reviewers stated, when taken as soon as you feel something coming on (for me it's either the beginning of a sore throat, with or without a headache, or that run-down feeling right before getting sick), this product has stopped those symptoms from advancing into something worse. My last two bottles have had a long shelf life /expiration date. I keep it in a cool, dark cupboard and seal it tight. They each worked more than a year after purchase. Come to think of it, I don't take any other products, just this one. And the taste isn't that bad to me...it's odd, herbal-y, not pleasant, but ok. Well worth the results!
