review/summary: Welch Allyn Suretemp Plus 690 Electronic Thermometer
review/text: The thermometer is really good once you get it working. I was not very happy that I bought it "Brand New" and when I tried to use it, didn't work. I had to ship the Thermometer Probe back, then waited for a week, then tried again and still wasn't working, so I ended having to ship back the Thermometer with all accesories. It took a few weeks to get it back and working.Welch Allyn however, were very good at keeping the guaranty and sending back to me the thermometer after it was fixed.
