review/summary: Worked like a CHARM!
review/text: I do not write reviews typically but this product changed my life! My periods have always been irregular, however I still did not expect them to just stop when I was 25.. I suffered the mental agony of never getting periods unless I took Provera when I decided enough was enough. The wise Internet came to my rescue and convinced me that Vitex could be the solution. I started taking this product once a day (first thing in the morning) for 120 days (2 boxes) with a gap of 2 days when I forgot to pack it on a business trip. During those 120 days, I got 5 periods (spotting, very light to light flow). Then I decided to give myself a week's break... and got my full fledged period. So, so thankful! If your doctor says everything's okay with you (yeah, right) BUT you just need Provera to get your period and fertility treatments to have children, I HIGHLY recommend you try this product. Just give it time to work. Good luck!
