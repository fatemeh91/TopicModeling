review/summary: Taken at First Sign of Cold
review/text: My wife and I have used this product for a number of years and feel it helps to avoid most colds and lessens the severity of colds that you get. We combine this with an increased dose of Vitamin C when we feel the onset of a cold. We use three stopper full doses three or four times a day when we feel it necessary.
