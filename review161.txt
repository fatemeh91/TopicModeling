review/summary: ran the first time I wore them
review/text: I have worn Jobst compression hose for a few years now. I havenever had a problem. I was thrilled when I had the option fora sheer pair....great for summer. The third time I wore one pair,I got a hole in them. I am not even sure how that happened. I figuredI must have done something. I put on my backup pair and the first timeI wore them I developed a hole in them...the same leg (right one). Nowthat I see these posts I know I will never purchase them again.
